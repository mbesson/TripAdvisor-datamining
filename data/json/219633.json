We have stayed at several 5-star all-inclusive hotels in Mexico and throughout the Caribbean, this resort has topped them all! The lobby, bars and lounge: -All beautiful, this is just a beautiful hotel. A very grand and beautifully decorated lobby and lobby-bar. You just want to hang-out there all evening, it feels so elegant!! The Food: -Buffet: had everything you could imagine, but pretty comparable to all other buffets we have seen in other 5-star resorts, but it was great. -Restaurants: Japanese- I live in Vancouver Canada, where we have some amazing Japanese food, so I wasn't sure how this was going to compare....I was quite impressed, the starter rolls were just so-so, but the rest of the meal was fabulous, I especially LOVED the tempura ice-cream, it is a must!! Brazilian- delicious, well -cooked meat, nothing too special, but really well-done. Steak-house - We LOVED the sea-food starter, extremely well-done, I got the 'Sea and Land', it was fabulous Krystal- This was my favourite restaurant, fine dining, a really wonderful meal, the sea-bass was amazing. Service: This is what made this hotel so amazing, I have never seen such amazing service. The waiting staff, the maids, to the front desk workers, to the entertainment staff had so much energy!! I never got the feeling that you had to tip to get good service, the waiters were literally running to get our drinks, they were amazing. The room: We had a junior suit on the 3rd floor facing the outside of the hotel (which actually meant we were looking at the hotel next door, but there was lots of trees which created privacy). This room was very quiet, but next time, I would request a lower room facing the court-yard, I just think we would have used our balcony more if we had something to look at from our window. But if you are looking for quiet and private, our room was perfect. The room was extremely clean and was kept clean all week (this goes back to the amazing service). The bathroom was basic, but very sufficient. The room itself was huge, huge bed and sitting area, lots of room for two people. The mini-bar was great, it had vodka, rum, tequila and whisky. Fridge was fully stocked with water, pop and beer. The person who fills the fridges only comes by in the mornings, and if your 'do not disturb' sign is out, they may miss you. But if you phone down to the front desks and let them know you were missed, they will come up to fill it immediately (they will even phone up to double check you are happy- again, amazing service). The pool: -At first I wasn't sure about the pool, it seemed small and I wondered if we would go down to the Riu Palace Playa del Carmen (a 10 minute walk down the beach) to use their pool, but I ended up really liking the pool, it is bigger than it initially seems. If you want a quieter space, just sit on the opposite side of the pool bar (you will still get lots of drinks because the service is so good, they are constantly coming around asking if you want another drink). The pool-bar side was lots of fun....had music, volleyball, water aerobics.....really fun. The pool loungers were really comfortable, but bring a little extra towel or a t-shirt or something to put on the bottom of the lounger where your towel doesn't cover because the cushion gets really hot from the sun. The beach: -Beautiful sand and clear blue water. There were lots of palm trees if you want to find some shade, but can pull the loungers out to get full sun. Again, amazing drink service on the beach. -The water does not have snorkelling right off the beach, which I found a bit disappointing. There were also a few days that the wind was really strong, which made for pretty big waves, so you had to work to cool off, but most days it was fairly calm. The Spa: -we each got a message at the beach, it was amazing!! The hotel clearly hires professionals, it was great! The entertainment: -My husband and I are not the biggest 'joiner' so we didn't do any of the schedule entertainment throughout the day...but we noticed there was always lots going on the the entertainment staff were extremely friendly. There was always volleyball, water aerobics, spanish lessons, yoga and so on going on. -The evening entertainment I was very pleasantly surprised with. The other resorts we have been at, the evening entertainment is usually super cheesy. But this resort clearly spend a bit of money to hire some professionals. There is always a band or musician in the court yard before the main show. The main shows usually consisted of different dance acts (ie. Brazilian, traditional Mexican) and they were all amazingly talented!! I was really surprised. The surrounding area: -The hotel is in a gated community called Playacar. There were about 10 resorts and many condos, townhouses and houses in the gated community. About a 5 minute walk down the street is a starbucks and an outdoor shopping area where you can get souvenirs. You felt extremely safe walking around the area. It is about a 20 minute walk into Playa del Carmen, 17 of those minutes are walking through the gated community. The busy tourist area of Playa del Carmen is literally 2 blocks outside the gated community, very convenient. If you don't want to walk in, there are lots of taxis. My husband and I wanted a relaxing trip where we didn't have to worry about anything and we got it. We had no problems at all with this resort, we had an amazing time!!", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "OH", "Title": "\u201cRIU Palace Mexico Very Relaxing! Some helpful hints...\u201d", "Author": "willow6868", "ReviewID": "UR126481611", "Content": "Great property. WEllmanicured grounds. Very nice pools and beach area. Lots of alternatives for food and activities. Be careful to watch out for a few practices at the resort: 1. Tips upon check-in are useless. We came in on a company trip with five couples and tipped the front desk guy $50 to get us some rooms close to the pools/beach. He said no problem. OUr rooms were not ready when we arrived but when we got our keys, the rooms were the furthest possible from the pools/beach and our patio faced a concrete wall (they called it \"garden view\"). After a whole lot of arguing they moved a couple of us closer to the pool but we still had the disappointing \"garden/concrete wall view\". 2. We asked for golf recommendations. They kept trying to sell us on this course that was 20 minute cab ride away (instead of the beautiful Playacar Golf Club within walking distance). He said he needed a cash deposit to hold the tee time. Then he changed the amount of the cash deposit needed when we started to object. We said no chance and decided to book Playacar...no cash deposit...no credit card needed! Seemed like the \"cash deposit\" would have been his commission if he got us to go to the far away course. 3. Food was excellent in our opinion. Many choices. Very hot and fresh. No problems getting the reservations for the nicer themed restaurants. The buffet was great. Wine served at each meal (or whatever you wanted). Champagne at breakfast! Very good! 4. Lots of free activities. Pool demo of scuba for free, Snorkel, Windsurf, Catamaran, etc all right on the huge, clean beach. Some topless sunbathers scattered throughout. 5. Free Wi-Fi in lobby (90 minutes per stay). Shopping within walking distance. Be careful, and know the exchange rates as they sometimes try to confuse you with dollars to pesos conversion. OUr first RIU experience. All other RIUs were right there. In my opinion, you could book any one of them and resort hop during your stay. No need to stay at the most expensive resort.

When we arrived we were very impressed by the main lobby - it's huge & very grand. All staff were very polite & were all very helpful. The room was very large, dark wood, plenty of hanging space, very large bed. Minibar with optics stocked up on a daily basis. Bathroom had bath, shower, toilet & bidet. Main buffet restaurant was good, a very large choice. You would have to be extremely fussy to not find anything you like to eat. We tried the speciality restaurants & found El Patio (Steak House) to be the best. Krystals (Fusions) was not very good at all, we had the lamb chops & they were so tough you could not cut them at all. The atmosphere in the restaurants was excellent thou. The waiters were always on hand filling your glasses with wine, champagne etc. The beach was wonderful, very large & lots of sunbeds. It did get extremely busy when we were there & we do prefer it to be a little quieter. My husband used the Scuba Caribe Dive Club on site which was excellent. He did a 10 day dive package & we went on a diving & snorkelling trip to Cozumel which was very good. We visited a couple of the nearby Riu Hotels for a drink, but the RPM appeared to be the best. We had a trip out by taxi to a nearby restaurant called Alux which was brilliant. It is a Cenote, very unique & well worth a trip. There were a couple of things that drew our attention & they were the bottom sheet on the bed - it did not fit & there was a large gap on one side with the plastic sheeting underneath showing - very uncomfortable. Then a very large group of teenagers arrived & were extremely rude & noisy. They were falling about drunk. I know they were on holiday & everybody is enjoying themselves, but it went a bit to far & was not appropriate for a 5 star Hotel. You do not expect this behaviour. I think the Management did try & sort them out, but it still spoiled 3 days of our well earned holiday. Also their parents were apparently with them, but obviously had no control over them & didnt mind them being so drunk they couldn't walk at 10 am in the morning!! Other than that we had a fantastic holiday & would recommend this Hotel as the staff are excellent, beach lovely & it is in a very nice locality.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario's Near North, Canada", "Title": "\u201cHad a Great Time\u201d", "Author": "CanUSGals", "ReviewID": "UR126203439", "Content": "(March 16, 2012) Just got back from a one-week vacation at the Riu Palace Mexico with a group of friends. This is a lovely all-inclusive resort. The weather was perfect, the pool is lovely, the beach is great. The resort is a nice size and caters to a vacationers looking for a quieter holiday. Anyone wanting dancing and late-night party time could spend time at the Riu Tiquilla across the street. We enjoyed our meals - and the a la carte restaurants (small venues with 2 dinner seatings, requiring reservations). Breakfasts start with my favorite Mamosa's - and a good selection of anything you could ask for. Lunch again offered everything you could want, from BBQ to salad buffet to wings. The dinner buffet was nice - although some of the meats (lamb and beef) were tough. The chefs do a great job of chicken, rice and pasta dishes and there was a good variety of speciality and ethnic cuisines. All meal venues were beautifully decorated, offering inside and outside dining. One of the venues is close to the beach and the pool, making it convenient for anyone enjoying these areas. Staff were excellent. The rooms are spacious - best if you can get one overlooking the courtyard. The only complaint about the room - and one shared by our fellow travellers - the beds were hard, needing an upgrade of softer pillows and sheets as well. The room was nicely cleaned and bar fridge replenished daily. There is a great staff/guest ratio - we never waited for anything - good service from the bar staff - never had a problem getting pool or beach chairs. The one major complaint we had, as well as other guests we spoke to - and from what we understand this was unusual blip of bad judgement for this resort - we had 2 days of \"March Break\" teenage drunken drama at the pool bar - annoying and ridiculous behavior - the so called \"parent\" chaperones who watched and did nothing - especially when bar staff were yelled at - should be ashamed. However, the hotel staff was quick to deter the group with other activities keeping the spoiled self-indulgent brats away from the mainstream vacationers. Staff members were friendly and hard working - thanks to Nando, Mateo, Ernesto and others - helping make our holiday more memorable.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cMy first experience at the Riu\u201d", "Author": "Gembe", "ReviewID": "UR126175814", "Content": "Our first vacation with friends was three years ago with a recommendation from a working collegue we arrived at the Riu Palace in Mexico.

I had been reading reviews before we booked, so I suppose I already knew the 'bad' points. (two beds pushed together, very firm mattresses, musty smell). But The good points out weight the bad points ten fold! The bad: Yes there are two queen beds pushed together, yes they are not very comfortable. The Good: The staff is beyond exceptional! Always a smile and 'hola' no matter if it was the grounds keepers or the bar keep. The Animation team goes out of their way to make everyone feel welcome. Aieda, Cindy, Freddy, DiDi from Japan, the 'VOLLEYBALL' guy (I am sorry I don't remember his name) and all the others, they were exceptional. There seemed to be enough activities to get involved in if we wanted to partake. The room was spacious, We were on the second floor facing the fountains, Great view! I did not notice a musty smell as others have complained about. We did take a few candles and an air freshener, but didn't need them. But I will keep them in the luggage, just in case. The food was incredible. The breakfast and lunch buffet gave you more than enough to choose from. I suggest going to the lunch buffet near the lobby, it seemed to have a nicer selection for lunch than the one on the beach had. We did go to the Steakhouse, the Krystal Fusion, and the Japanese restaurant, the steakhouse was just OK, the other 2 were great. The Japanese restaurant served a lot of food, maybe it was all the rice on the sushi, whatever it was, I couldn't finish my meal, but it was good! We went to Krystal three times, I would have gone more, but we did want to try the buffet for dinner too. Needless to say Krystal fusion was my favorite. The buffet was good also, so much variety, and always fresh. Defiantly not the 'average' dry meat, old casserole buffet. And the desserts.. mmm. The ice cream was SO good! The pool/ beach area is perfect, yes the rooms are a bit of a walk to the beach, but it is so beautifully landscaped, we didn't care. It was a nice walk. With the exception of Sunday, we always had plenty of chairs to pick from either at the pool or the beach. We enjoy the shade, and there was always an umbrella available by the pool, but the bases are HEAVY. So I had the guys move it as the sun moved through the sky. The Beach is pristine! They rake the sand daily, so by the time the sun is up, the seaweed is gone. The staff here really does everything they can to make your stay great. The beach is also walkable in both directions, if you head north you will be in town in about 35 minutes. nice walk. They are planning a reno of this place later this year, so I was worried that the place would just be old and run down, but it is not. It is old, there are signs of age, but it is so well kept that you really have to look to see some of the age. Location: is great! We were close enough to check out the other Riu properties, and close enough to go into town without a hassle. Playacar is a gated community, with plenty of sidewalks for strolling. Very nice area! Overall, this place rocked my socks off :) I would go back today if we could afford it.

The difference with other Riu\u2019s in Negril or the Dominican Republic is that you are not confined in your hotel. The surroundings are very nice for walking and very secure, even in the evening. There is a plaza with some shops in front of the Riu Playacar, just a few minutes walking from the Palace Mexico. Many people are always walking and jogging on the road along the hotels, you will never feel in danger. You can walk to the center of Playa del Carmen but we choose to take a taxi (70 pesos or 7 $, so the price is far better in pesos) because otherwise you might be tired already when arriving in town. There are lots of shops and restaurants downtown; you can easily spend a few hours strolling there. Also along the beach, it is possible to walk endlessly on both sides of the hotel. We often went to the Riu Yucatan just next door. They have a garden that is more like a forest, where you can see monkeys in the trees. The food in Palace Mexico was good and varied. The magnificent lobby has many sofas to sip a good cocktail. We had a seafront room (1045), but be aware that you cannot see the sea because of the very dense palm trees. The beach is nice with no rocks, so you do not need sea shoes. The beach is incredibly large so be prepared to do some walking before you reach the water. The water had already a good temperature but there are always waves so forget the snorkeling in front of the hotel. From the beach you can see the ferries connecting Playa del Carmen and Cozumel. We took the Ultramar ferry. The price was 312 pesos for an adult return ticket. It was a large catamaran (up to 500 passengers) with a nice band playing live music.

Please tip - we brought 100 - $1 bills - they don't make a lot and many don't. The Good *beautiful beach, good waves for boogey boarding, and palm trees in the sand so you had your choice of sun or shade. We found that we could always find a lounger at any time so no need to get there early. Our kids loved playing in waves and digging in the sand. *The lobby bar was great. Very relaxing, enjoyed banana martinis and the kids could get virgin cocktails. Super service *Courtyard seating - a great place for after dinner cocktails, listen to music, and we met a lot of great people. They bring the drinks quickly. They do have Don Julio here (but not at pool) *Pool bar (Ernesto was great)- occassionally busy but they keep them coming. We will bring large mugs next time - drinks are weak but you ask them to top it off with coconut rum or tequilla. They had volleyball games going & the pool was plenty big. The deep ends were a bit deep for our 8 year old but he was fine with 3 foot section near bar. Kids enjoyed the kiddie cocktails. Poolbar is in the shade late afternoon which is a nice break from son. *Restaurants - Japanese was very good and our kids liked it which is saying something. Brazilian had some nice skewers. Fusion had a couple interesting options like pumpkin scallop soup which we liked. Steak house - we loved the bake alaska (see more under the bad section). Buffet - a ton of choices, you can pour yourself a mamosa/blood mary and choices of omelletes, occassional good sea food (giant shrimp, crab, sushi,) extensive fruit selections, etc. We didn't get bored. *Room - loved the sitting area, cigar on the balcony (small balcony), and towel decorations (swan was great) . More on room under ok/bad. We were fortunate to have 2nd floor toward the pool so nice view of courtyard and quieter. *Hotel - fountains are very beautiful - nice facility. *Staff - 99% were super friendly. We kept running into a maitrede who rememembered our kids and joked with them. *not related to hotel, but check Edventure Tours if you want a great day outing of Tulum/Coba, zip lines, cenotes, and swimming with the turtles. Highly recommend. The O.K. *workout room was basic, served its purpose. *mini bar - liquor dispensors were full and fridge replenished but without proper mixers, you really wouldn't drink the vodka or tequilla. Tip - bring mug, fill it up from your dispenser, and then take to beach to make your drinks stronger. *Steakhouse - meat was so so. Not sure if beef is just bad in Mexico, edible but nothing exciting. Almost \"bad\" but saved by the baked alaska. *lunch at restaurants near pool - didn't ever change options. Fun to build your own taquitos or other stuff to a point but got repititious. Italian didn't have much of interest except when kids wanted pizza. *evening shows. After a few cocktails, the lip synched reenactment of movies hits was kind of funny, with no cocktails, you may not be so impressed. You can tell they really try hard to put on fun shows but you just can't have too high of expectations. The Bad *some Europeans just shouldn't be wearing speedos or going topless on the beach *beach bar - nice location, but I was watching them \"wave\" the bottle over the top of the blender without putting much in. Order a straight shot to go with your margarita and dump it in to make it a drink. *Kids club - tiny and not suited for those over 5-6. Fortunately, my kids (8 and 10) finally made friends with other kids on beach to hang out with during evening shows and swimming. They did enjoy the beach activities like soccer which was open to all ages. There is not much for kids 7+ at this resort. The evening kids shows were totally hokey but my kids went anyway and kind of had fun (and gave us a chance to sit outside, have a relaxing cocktail, and socialize). *men should be able to wear long shorts in the restaurants at night. The Ugly *beds with plastic under sheets and hard pillows are hot and not super comfortable.

After a pleasant transfer from the airport we were greeted at the hotel with a warm welcome and a cold cocktail and allocated a room on the first floor facing the Riu hotel next door. The room was lovely, plenty of space and an absolutely massive bed! Others have mentioned that the bed was hard but it was perfectly fine for us and we never noticed any join where the 2 normal beds had been put together to form one. We did mention to reception that it was out honeymoon and that our travel agent had advised to ask about the free fruit basket for honeymooners and were told that they would sort something out for us, later that day they called us over as we were passing and told us that they had upgraded our room! we were now in a similar room but with an inward facing balcony overlooking the internal grounds and fountains, even though we were perfectly happy with the original room, having that view really did make quite an improvement to our stay! The hotel is kept spotlessly clean, one morning when still suffering from jet lag I popped to the bar to get coffees at about 6 am and I counted 15 staff members cleaning and polishing just in the 50 yards from the reception area to the bar! The food was excellent! The buffet for breakfast in particular was magnificent, My wife was particularly enamoured with the Omelette station whereas I always found myself in a battle to resist visiting the waffle and pancake area after picking up my bacon and scrambled eggs. With chocolate milk and champagne (hey, we were on honeymoon!) to wash it down we were like pigs in muck! As with all the staff we encountered, the guys at breakfast were great, really friendly and accommodating and able to find us a table in the outside area even when the hotel was apparently at capacity during our second week. We didn\u2019t visit the buffet much for evening meals, preferring to use the speciality restaurants most nights, we never had any problem getting a table for these for either the early or late sitting. With the jet lag we tended to go for the late sitting first week (giving time for a nap!) and then the late sitting the second week. We visited Fusion 3 times, this was our favourite and managed to have at least 1 different course each time, The Japanese we visited twice which again lovely. The Brazilian & Steakhouse we visited once each, not ideal for my vegetarian wife but she managed to find something nice to eat as she does eat fish. The other nights we ate at the buffet or in PDC as we had a couple of days/nights on the town. We did visit the other Rius apart from Lupita during our stay and although they all seemed lovely we came away feeling Glad that we chose the one we did as it just seemed to have everything exactly as we wanted it. I used the Sports bar at the Tequila a couple of mornings to catch the Manchester united games but as it was only a 5 minute walk from door to door I didn\u2019t mind the Riu Palace not having a sports bar at all. We loved loved loved the Cubana bar, trying all the different cocktails and martinis. We liked that it was quite elegant and made us feel like getting dressed up before our meals rather than going casual, not that you would be made to feel uncomfortable if you did but it just made it feel all that more special and exclusive for us. We are beachy people and spent most days there rather than at the pool, the beach area is fantastic whether you want shade or full exposure to the sunshine you can always grab a bed and pretty much pick your spot. You can either walk up to the beach bar if you fancy a drink or wait for one of the guys to come round with their tray of ready made cocktails. We tended to stop off at the pool on our way back to the room for a few drinks at the swim up bar or sat around the pool, the sun doesn\u2019t seem to reach much of the pool area in the late afternoon, but we had usually had enough of it for the day by then anyway. Now to the hotel\u2019s main asset and best feature, Its wonderful staff! They really could not be faulted, always friendly and eager to help, we have never experienced that level of service before. Coming from England I am usually quite daunted by the etiquette of when and how much to tip when in countries where it is the norm, especially when doing it face to face when you are not paying a bill after a meal. I think we muddled through even though we never felt like the staff were looking for a tip, or were annoyed if you didn\u2019t. We would normally give 50 pesos at meals and 20 pesos to the drinks guys but not every time, Don\u2019t worry too much as you soon get an idea of how to approach it and a feel for when & how much to tip. The resort of Playa Del Carmen is definitely worth a visit, its about 30 mins walk or 70 pesos in a taxi, there are some lovely bars and places to eat, worth going for a few drinks in the day or night if you like that sort of thing. Also I would recommend Coco Bongos if you like a bit of a party night out and I would definitely recommend the VIP as you get drinks to your table and a better view and its good to have seats at is a pretty long show. A tip if you are coming from the UK maybe leave it until the 2nd week so that the Jet lag has worn off as the show starts at 11 and goes on till 2 (we got home about 4.30am) so you will need plenty of energy! We also caught the bus to Cancun one day and had a day there, it was really cheap getting the bus and we also used the 2 Rius there for a swim and drinks as they are close to Hard Rock and the other bars that are open in the day. Just don\u2019t miss the last bus home(about 9pm I think) as we almost did!! Also Xel Ha is a great place to visit for the day with drinks and food included and great snorkelling around the massive lagoon, it is great that you can wander wherever you like around the lagoon (within reason) and get in and out at lots of different points. You really feel as though are exploring the area rather than in park and doing lots of queuing.

Otherwise you can eat warm donuts and desserts everyday. We went to the Japanese restaurant- I thought it was quite good. The fusion restaurant I didn't care for at all. BEACH- The beach here is great. It's very nice and there are plenty of palm trees if you want shade. The only thing is there are no umbrellas available. Also the drinks they serve you are very watered down. Stick with beer or soda in a can. Soda out of the spout tasted like syrup.

I have stayed at Riu's in the past but never a Palace and was worth the extra dollars, though I did get a smoking deal at the time! From the moment we checked in the front desk was more than accommodating in getting us a room near the beach area, though we initially had a room near the lobby. All the staff more than eager to please. The grounds very nicely kept, the room like past Riu's very comfortable and nice having the sitting area.

The buffet, lots to choose from and food was really very good - I usually dont like buffets. The beach....well what can I say about the beach other than perfect! I'm not a pool person but, seemed there was lots of activity always going on out there. But, the beach really was perfect and never did I have a problem finding a lounge (neither did my Mom who stayed at the pool area. I also like that there was bar service at the beach area, didn't always have to get up for a drink. Seems that one of the best kept secrets is the hammock area between the pool and beach area. I used the hammocks quite a bit and never was there more than 1 or 2 people out there. It was a great place to hide out (under a tree) from the rain and do some reading. I really enjoyed my stay at the Palace and would probably have a hard time not staying at another Palace resort the service and food (buffet) really are a notch above.

The hotel is located about 45 minutes from Cancun airport, so the transfer to the hotel is not bad at just under an hour. The resort is well maintained and kept very clean from the rooms to the lobby to the grounds. They have a selection of about four to five a la carte restaurants and a large buffet which is pretty typical for most Riu Palace resorts. The food and service were very good, although not excellent. The beach area is very large and even has a bar located on it. During the time we were there, there was no need to grab towels early and save seats at either the pool of the beach, as we were always able to find them. Although we did have a nice time at the resort there were a few things that we did notice that were working against it. First, the resort appears to have been built in the early 90s and is really in need of a makeover to bring it up to the same standards as most other RIU Palace resorts. The pool area was very dated (a little grimy) and does not have any access for those that are either disabled, or older and need assistance getting into the pool. In other words there are no ladders, or stairs (like we see in newer pools) for those needing assistance. The rooms, although very clean, were also a bit dated. Finally, the other surprising thing was that there were no ocean view/front rooms at the resort. The resort is set quite a distance from the beach area and based on the setup of the hotel, there is are no views from the rooms, other than the garden. We were told that the resort will be closed during the summer months and major areas will be renovated. So, if you are looking to make a trip down to Playa and want the true RIU Palace experience, maybe consider the RIU Palace Riveria Maya which is just down the street and newer, until this one is redone in August.

As we expected, the property is clean and in great condition, the food and entertainment is fun, and the staff is very very friendly! Our only minor gripe would be the check-in process... we arrived around 12pm the day of check-in and were greeted by the front-desk staff. They informed us that our rooms would not be available until 3pm. No worries, the restaurant, beach, pool and all other facailties were open and ready to be used. We were told our bags would be brought to our rooms when they were ready. Well come to our surprise 4 hours later, the bags were still in the lobby and it seems like they were completely forgotten. No worries though, it's vacation right! Anyone who has visited a Riu Palace property will knows what to expect and can be reassured about the quality of the food and staff. Everyone goes out of their way to make you comfortable... awesome! We visited the Spa during our trip for a massage... Yes services seem pricey, but $20-30 for mani or peti and up is about normal for any resort. Once again the staff was very gracious and did a great job. Last but certainly not least is the beach. This Riu is situated on a very large piece of property and no kidding the beach is HUGE! The water is probably at least 200 yards from the edge of the resort which is awesome. The sand is clean and the water is crystal clear and warm. The resort provides plenty of lounge chairs and there is a large group of palm trees between the pool and the sand that provides lots of shade. The resort was fairly full when we were there and we did not have much trouble at all finding a shady spot (this can't always be said about other resorts we've been to in the past). There are bartenders continually circulating amongst the lounge chairs with drinks of all sorts (water, mojitos, pina colladas, and more)!

We decided to give the Riu chain another chance this year and stayed at the Riu Palace Mexico .... we loved it The food- was great so good I came home weighing a lot more than when I left - We ate at the Specialty restaurants - Steak and La Bodega - Our steaks were great and they give you so much food - it is impossible to eat it all -- The La Bodega is a lot of different meats ... chicken, steak, sausage, turkey.... Most of the time we ate dinner in the Don Julian - and found the variety overwhelming - a word to the men though bring a pair of long pants to wear at dinner even if you are eating in the buffet... LONG pants are required - they do enforce as we saw several gentlemen turned away because they had dress shorts on - the El Patio and La Traviata are 2 restaurants on the beach and serve lunch daily - good salad bar and one has Italian food and the other is more mexican and american .. We did go over to the Riu Yucatan next door for lunch one day --- don\"t waste your time - it was horrible The Room - We stayed in the rooms on bottom floor behind the Don Julian restaurant- rooms 83-94 - Okay these rooms never see sunshine so they are damp ... when we go back again we are requesting rooms on the 2nd or 3rd floor... so we get some air circulating and some light ... The rooms were fine always clean and refrig stocked but just never dryed out. The hotel is closing down Aug 1st for a renovation of the rooms and if you go to room 001 you can see what the new rooms will look like ... quite interesting - anyway just a tip to let you know ask for upper level room The Beach - Big and Long - have a beach bar so don't have to walk too far and a couple of days thay had a young man that came around with trays of drinks all different kinds - their cups are small - maybe 6oz - so bring a larger container to put several drinks in the bathrooms are up in the 2 beach restaurants ... Pool bar they have an upper and lower bar - together - swimup bar is on the lower and walk up bar on top - bathrooms are next to the pool bar .... if you don't get down to the pool by 9 forget about getting a chair... never had a problem at the beach lots of seating ....they have towel cards - the towel place only opens at 8 so we always exchanged our towels at 5 so we would have fresh towels in the morning as we were early risers... The Animation entertainers were excellent - Aida was the best - always coming around and talking to us -- play bingo and bocci ball -- that's about all we did but they have at lot of other things to do .... The lobby bar - great drinks - Hiram and his crew always kept our glasses full Would we go to this Riu agan - definitely the only downside to our trip was when we checked in - it was a short gentleman- commented that we were early -- heh funjet dropped us off at 11am and ... the gentleman told us our room would not be ready til 3pm and this is how he said it - It's 11 that's 11 to 12 to 1 to 2 to 3pm - 4 hours come back then -- he was really rude... we got our rooms at 3:15pm I wish I would have got his name ......", "Date": "February 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "upstate,NY", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, Clean rooms\u201d", "Author": "ny_mt_girl", "ReviewID": "UR124538298", "Content": "January 2012. Stayed at the RIU Palace Mexico. An all inclusive in Playa Del Carmen. We also had the RIU, Yucatan, Tequila, & Palace close by to be able to use as well, Except for dinner. Be sure to get a room overlooking the fountains, Pretty views but be closer to the pool as every night some entertainment would go on till 11:00 PM so if you want quiet stay closer to the pool. No ocean view as the building is a distance from it for hurricane protection. The room was very clean but the couch was so old it was sagging to much to sit on. We enjoyed our balcony & a comfy bed that had a topper on it. Be sure to get one. The room also had a bar & fridge with micers & plenty of water to use for drinking or brushing your teeth to making coffee. My husband likes Scotch so we asked them to switch a bottle & they just left a full sealead bottle of J&B in the room. Plenty of hot water for showers. The lobby/ lobby bar always had inscents burning. A bit overpowering for me but mus be used to help with the musty smell. The buffet was always plentful, fresh & something for everyone.Out of the specialty restaurants that you would make reservations for The Brazilian Steakhouse was the best. Fusion was awful & we were 10 minutes late and we were scolded like children and almost turned away. They would have done us a favor as the buffet was better. I am a wine drinker & use to be in the business. The wine is swill.. Just awful. That was a huge disapointment. I would have been happy to purchase a better wine but not available. All inclusive means plenty of drinking But be sure to ask for the rum in your pina colada or else you may not notice any.. We brought plenty of US single dollars for tipping & they sure remembered you & took care of you. We were about a week early for the warmer beach/pool weather but still enjoyed our stay. Overall I would go back, find a liquor store for my wine or buy it at the airport duty free & bring it with me. for less than $10.00 US. You can take a cab \"Downtown\" get away from the inital drop off and walk further away into the nicer section withthe better shops & restaurants. The shop people are constantly barking at you to go into their shops it is annoying. Across the street from the hotel entrance and just a few yards away is a small shopping area. It is clean & safe & a starbucks is there if you feel the need. Playa Del Carmen is a great location. We liked the securtity felt good. The beach is large & pretty w/ plenty of chairs. I will try a RIU property again. The staff was Wonderful, except tfor the one guy at Fusion. Everyone was friendly. You get your moneys worth. Maybe we will go back after the renovations. I would go again as we really enjoyed our trip.

We usually go to different resorts so I was worried that I would be \"let down\" by going to the same place twice but that didn't happen! As before, we found the resort in excellent shape even though it is planning on a complete reno this spring. Heard many comments \"why?\". I asked the receptionist about the plans & he said, the rooms will completely be re-done, the alacartes will be changed & upgraded, a 24 sports bar will be added and the pool will be re-done. Am sure there are other upgrades planned along with those. The beach is the same - long, wide, sandy, sunny, shady and the water a crystal blue. Service was exceptional as before. Rooms were clean, orderly & very function-able. There was some construction going on which resulted in some room changes. A few hair dryers were \"\"weak\" but unless someone tells them - how are they to know? And what a weak complaint! lol We had reservations at 3 of the ala-cartes. Personally, we enjoyed the Steakhouse the most. As Nebraskans, we think we know \"beef\" & we can say our steaks were very tender & tasty. Plus they present a sea-food platter as an h'orderve with clams, crab leg cuts, etc.... Salmon was also on the menu. Service was exceptional. The Krystal restaurant was our least favorite. I had the Sea Bass which was wonderful but it is a very light fish so was glad my hubby had the filet & shared it with me. Their h'orderves are very unusual but all was fun. Again, can't ask for better service. The Brazilian Restaurant was truly a different experience with all the different meats. From ribs, beef, chicken etc... you are ready to bust! It all is prepared on rotisseries & shaved off at your table. Our Olympus Travel representative arranged for our group to take the 8:30 seating so it was a treat to be able to dine together our last night. Again, the service was unsurpassed. The buffet is the best - I don't care what anyone says! If you can't find anything good to eat at that for either breakfast or dinner, something is wrong! Service is excellent. Contrary to another review - plenty of fresh fruit is available!! Yes, they do have wine and/or beer or non-alcohol drinks or any other cocktail anyone wants. Service & smiles are the norm. The beach restaurant was also very good for lunch but how can we eat soo much! The carrot cake was so good, we were tempted to take the whole cake to our table. lol This year was the first to find a shortage of beach loungers but it happened just one day after a couple days of over-cast skies & showers so everyone hit the beach. We found beach service only one day out of the 7 but we figured out that if the pool isn't busy, it gives them a chance to serve the beach. Lots of volleyball was played in the pool by our group. A friendly game between the Germans & USA! Both teams had their own cheerleaders and both sides knew it was \"in fun\". Actually, most of us are all Germans by ancestory! Free water sports are available. They punch your arm band & then you have usage rights for a 1/2 hour or hour depending on how busy they are. I was disappointed in the live band in the plaza. It just wasn't as good in my opinion as last year. But, evening rain showers put a damper on the plaza's activities. I was also a bit disappointed on the Superbowl game reception. Last year, they held it in the theatre. This year, the time frame did not interfere with the evening theatre hours but they held it in a conference room & of course, the tallest, biggest guy was sitting in the front row, blocking the view for us \"shorties\". Oh well, wasn't really a big Superbowl fan this year! Overall, nightly entertainment was lacking but the other Riu's are available for other options. Two nights, they had guest interactive games. The Las Vegas night was a good show. Overall, we just can't find much to complain about. The Riu Palace Mexico is well run, a resort with lots of class, exceptional food & service, the best beach & nice functional rooms.

This is the 2nd resort we\u2019ve visited in the Riviera Maya in the last year. Overall it was a good hotel, great beach and great service. First impressions were great but as the week went on the little things added up. Here\u2019s what I thought, -Friendly staff and excellent service, all the other reviews about the great service and friendly staff were right \u2013 they were accommodating, quick, and always pleasant -Beautiful Beach \u2013 the beach is large with palm trees so you can get both sun and shade, they also have hammocks in the palm trees for a siesta. Usually you had to get down before 10 am to get a beach chair, most ppl throw towels down early to reserve and come back later. The beach is one of the best features of the resort. -Rooms \u2013 rooms are large with a sunken living room, mini bar and a balcony, only complaints were the hair dryer \u2013 didn\u2019t work, we asked for a new one and they had someone up and switched it for another one within 20 mins, but even the newer one didn\u2019t work very well, I would recommend to bring your own. Also, there were ants in our room anytime food or drinks were out. We keep things clean and never left food out but even a pop bottle that had its cap completely closed tight still brought them all over the bottle and table within 20 mins. They even were after water. If we wanted a drink we had to put it back in the fridge if we didn\u2019t drink the whole thing immediately. Our room was on the 3rd floor(top floor) and was facing the Riu Yucatan. The path was right below our balcony for the golf carts and ppl walking to go back and forth to the beach from the other Riu resorts across the street. The carts are gas powered and start running around 8 am. We live in the city so the noise didn\u2019t bother us but it was fairly loud so light sleepers might not enjoy that. FYI \u2013 there are no rooms in the hotel that have any ocean or beach view. -Pool \u2013 it\u2019s narrow and small. The area for the fountains is larger than the pool, but with how nice the beach is we preferred to be out there anyway. -Facilities are clean and well maintained (even though a bit dated), some tiles move in the hallway when you walk on them but this should be fixed once the renovations are done at the end of the year. -Location \u2013 the RPM is in a secure community of 11 resorts, golfcourse, and condos, etc \u2013 you can feel safe for a 30 min walk to Playa Del Carmen or to the shops across the street, etc. Only a 10 min drive from Xplor/Xcaret parks and 45 mins from airport. I really liked the area, everything was close by and lots to do. -Food- it was decent but I\u2019ve had better. I have celiac disease which is basically a food allergy to gluten and the options here were very limited. In Mexico I\u2019m used to corn tortillas in food instead of wheat but at this resort it seemed they used more flour tortillas for most things. For the options I did have the food was okay but a lot of things were undercooked I found-particularly red meats. Chicken was good but the other meats were fatty and undercooked to my liking but to each their own. Had I not been restricted in my options I think I would have been more satisfied with the buffet but overall we both agreed that the Barcelo was better. -Specialty Restaurants \u2013we only tried the steakhouse on the last night we were there. Everywhere it tells you that you need to book the specialty restaurants for the same day between 830-1030 am, the only issue we had with that was that we came out of the buffet from breakfast at 8 am thinking we had a half hr to kill before we would go book the steakhouse for the 630 pm sitting and we noticed a small line was there starting to book the restaurants. We went over and sure enough they started at 8 and by the time we got to book(5 mins later) all the spots had been filled for the 630 pm sitting, only 830 pm was left. Why would you state everywhere that you book between 830-1030 and even tell us that at check in but then allow ppl to start booking at 8am? I don\u2019t get it. The steakhouse was actually just the outside patio snack bar that we eat at midday, nothing fancy, no a/c, sand still on the floor and despite being supposedly an upscale hotel most ppl at the tables were wearing jeans, running shoes and a t-shirt. Felt over dressed in my dress clothes. The staff was awesome as they were the whole trip. My wife had the chicken and that was good, I ordered the rib eye and it was probably the toughest steak I\u2019ve ever ate \u2013 if you go to the steak house, do not order the steak which seems odd to be saying. They served fries with dinner and they were good with the seasoning but we only got like a tablespoon sized serving of mashed potatoes. The staff was good enough that I would say you should try a specialty restaurant but definitely order the chicken or try another one of the restaurants b/c the steak is something you shouldn\u2019t bother trying. We had a great time, the beach and the service were the strongest traits, everything else seemed minor but for the money we paid I think there are better resorts out there. I\u2019m sure most things would be solved after the renovations but I preferred the Barcelo over the Riu.", "Date": "February 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cRIU Palace Mexico\u201d", "Author": "Kate S", "ReviewID": "UR124263799", "Content": "We stayed at the RIU Palace Mexico at the end of March 2010. I travel a couple times a year and this is still 1 of my favourite hotels and places. The hotel itself is gorgeous and very luxurious. The buffet is the best buffet ever with a variety of delicious food and different themes every night. We also had room service which was much better than some all inclusive but not comparable to the amazing buffet. The club was at RIU Tequila which was right across the street (a very short walk) and because we stayed at a palace we were able to go to any of the 5 RIU's to swim, drink, or eat lunch. The club was mainly a younger crowd. The Palace Mexico had entertainment in the evening and then around 10 it started to get a little quiet. Playa del Carmen is a 5 minute cab ride...and that is where you can have lots of fun at night. There are many excellent clubs with wonderful entertainment. there are also many stores, markets, restaurants and bars. The town is something that needs to be visited during the day and at night. From there you can also take a short boat ride to Cozumel, which is also very beautiful. Within walking distance of the hotel there is a small outdoor mall. There you can get beautiful jewellery, snacks, clothes, souvenirs, ect. There is also a bank there. My only warning is not to buy jewellery from the hotel market that they have in the evening because you can get it 10 times cheaper at the outdoor mall or in Playa del Carmen. Tours There are many tours offered from the hotel. We went on explore which was a day trip that included: zip-lining, swimming in caves, taking a raft through the caves and lunch. It was worth it. We also went on the catamaran tour. It included snorkelling at a coral reef, lunch, beers and cocktails, and free time in the water. This was a relaxing and fun trip where you can meet people. however the coral reef was not nearly as pretty as the one in cuba. On our last day we rented a boat from the hotel and went fishing. It was our group of 5 plus 2 of the workers. we went for a ride on the boat while the fishing stuff was hooked up (I am not a fisher so I am unaware of terms) then asked them to take us snorkelling and that was much funner than the tour snorkelling. We had beers (bring some extra though), took pictures on and off the boat and we got to drive the boat which was very fun and wild. There Staff were amazing. Service was excellent! Food was delicious! There is so much to do in Playa del Carmen that we only slept a few hours each night. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone because you have the option to play at any of the other 4 RIU's within walking distance. we spend one day hotel hopping and meeting people and using the other RIU's pools. If it is within your budget I recommend staying at either the Palace Mexico or the Palace Riviera May because you then have the option to visit all of the RIU's", "Date": "February 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chattanooga, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201criu palace mexico\u201d", "Author": "shannon w", "ReviewID": "UR124235848", "Content": "We just returned today fro Riu Palace Mexico.

Have lunch in any of the hotels and drinks of course. You are asked to have your breakfast and evening meal at your own hotel.( Some of the other Rius cannot use the Palace hotels) The flexibilty of being able to wander around a resort really enhanced our holiday. Perfectly save to wander around during the day or evening. Playa del Carmen is a 35min walk through the Playacar resort or a 40 min gentle stroll up the beach. Plenty of taxis (90 pesos \u00a34 approx from the far end of 5th Avenue). Had already upgraded to a suite and had emailed the hotel in advance to request a 1st floor or above room with an unobstructed view.we had room 1058 traditionally furnished .Clean well presented bathroom lounge area and bedroom with a walk in wardrobe and a spacious balcony with a really lovely view over the fountains. Four optics in room with various premium liquors and a fridge full of beer .soda and water all replenished on a daily basis.(husband prefers a darker beer left a not in the fridge asking for cerveza negra/amber returned that evening to find a fridge full of dark beer GREAT!!) We would definitely upgrade to a suite and request an upper floor room (loved the space we had). Absolutely no problem in making bookings for the speciality restaurants always room expecially for the 2nd sitting.We enjoyed the Steak restaurant probably best. We also ventued out to dine in Playa del Carmen our recomendations would be evening meal at Ajua Maya ( excellent mexican cuisine with flare and theatrics at your table with a really good house band ) Lunch at Carboncitos and coffee and all things chocolate at Ah Cacao.We understand that the hotel is going to be reavmped sometime this year it will be interesting to go and back and see whats been done.

As some reviewers seem to speak of the negatives I will begin my review the same First, there was a picture in our room that was hanging crooked. Then there was a weed in one of the hedges that did'nt get picked for 2 days. Once the container of warm milk for morning coffee was'nt quite full. Then at one of the restaurants there was a fork that was on the wrong side. I could go on and on but I'll stop there. Plain and simply it's the staff that keeps us coming back. The front desk staff is very fast and efficient. Anything they can do for you they do. The housekeeping staff are always around and always have a smile and an Hola! for you. The grounds crew is amazing. The clippin' and trimmin' and sweepin' never seem to stop. Every day the hundreds of beach chairs end up all over the place. In the morning everything is back in perfect line ready to go. They even have this beach zamboni thing that cleans and grooms the sand. The staff at the restaurants are friendly and professional. If you want something they don't have, they go find it for you. The activity crew are buzzing around the place from morning to night and are always up to get everyone involved. The evening enterainment is great with different shows and dancers who really work there butts off. The staff at the buffet are all so friendly and fast. Our morning guy Abraham knew what you needed before you did and had it there pronto. Juan Santoyo runs his area with great pride and is second to none. As this resort is about 15 years old it is about time for and is scheduled for a reno this summer. If any of the RIU brass comes across this, here are a couple of suggestions if you haven't already got them on your list. 1. Pleeeeeeeease get rid of the Canadian Mist as your house rye. As you have thousands of Canadians as your guests, I can tell you that no one drinks this garbage. Canadian Club is almost as bad. 2. Move the room safes up to eye level. Us old guys can't bend and stoop as well as we once could and having them on the floor is a real pain. If you raised them up you could build shelves under them which would give the ladies somewhere to put all the shoes they bring. 3. Bring in whatever heavy equipment you need to annilate the pool. You have plenty of room to make it like the big brother palace down the street. Put the swim up bar facing the beach where it gets sun past 10 am. 4. This is the important one. As the headbords never need to be moved, please screw them to the wall. Jamming a pillow in between the headbord and the wall wastes precious energy that is required elsewhere.

Our travel agency person sold this to us as only real 5 star hotel she has ever stayed in. I do not know where she has been before but I have to say that to me this one did not come up as 5 stars. First impression of the place was very promising but then we started to notice the small little details that separates the real 5 start places from this one. I try to be now as impartial as I can and list some details that may help others to have more realistic expecatations of the place. Rooms: Nice and spacious. They look clean but soon you will notice that for example the floor is not really properly cleaned. When you walk there barefoot after the shower your feet will be soon black. Our room was facing sister hotel Riu Yukatan and first we thought it must be quiet location but soon realized that the golf cart taking people from main road to beach starts to operate at 8 am and goes on all day. The noise is so horrible it will wake you up. I wonder why they don't have electric ones.... Chairs at the balcony are very nice. And air condition is also smart, it will turn off automatically if you leave balcony door open. Mini bar: Fridge is stocked with sodas and beer but no wine available. Could be ordered through room service, I believe. I it would be nice to have mini bottles in room too. Embarrassing to this hotel was that they had fake Smirnoff vodka in Sminrnoff bottle. In my understanding that is kind of illeagle in most of the world. When we mentioned this in reception and requested the real stuff they tried to look suprised and said they could not understand what has happened. But still they changed the bottles also in the rooms of our group even though they had not complained, yet. So obviously the have the fake stuff in there hoping people will not notice the difference. Every night we had to call for refill of the minibar and it took several calls. First we call and ask for certain items, then we call again after an half an hour. Then someone appears at the door asking what we need (we had said that already on the phone). Then we call again after half an hour and soon someone comes with the refill. Then after about 2 hours reception calls and asks if the refill has happened, 3,5 hours after our first call!!!! I would not call this first class service. And seriously, this happened every night. Reception: Lady who checked us in was very very nice and effective. She said she is Hungarian but cannot remeber her name. But unfortunately she was the only one appearing that way. Others did not know anything about Playa del Carmen or did not want to help. They had dirty uniforms which I think is real embarrasment for any hotel, let alone 5 stars. Once we asked from reception if it is normal that cleaners empty all the coins from ashtrays in the rooms. This happened in first day, my husband placed on my advice all his change to ashtray and when we returned to room it was all gone. In the end it was suppose to be tip to house hold but we did not realize they will take it first day. Anyhow, we asked if this is common practice and we just were stupid foreigners who do not understand the local habits. Clerk from reception said that that probably is whats has happened, cleaning person must have thought it is meant for him. But anyhow he promised to check this. He never returned to topic. Well, we did consider this when we left our final tip. Pool: you have to have a card to get a towel (1 pce) for you from the pool. In my experience in 5 star hotel you do not need any cards, you can get as many towels as you want and leave them anywhere. Here they tell you very clearly what you will be charged if you do not return the card of the towel while checking out. First morning there were not any towels available around 8:45 am. And you cannot return your towel after 6 pm. There isn't any other access to pool but horrible staircases, I mean those metallic ones with couple of steps. You cannot really walk into the pool. The water was very very cold. Restaurants: For first couple of nights the dinner buffet is ok. The salad / cold appetizers table is really nice but same every day. Warm food was not so good. Mostly dried up or cold. But some nice exception to that were found most of the time. White wine they give you as default is something very cheap and not nice but if you ask you will get better one. But again, in 5 start hotel do you need to ask for nice wine? Lunch buffet was good, at least for lunch I would not require anything else. Breakfast was the best part of the day. The selection is huge! A la carte restaurants were very average. In my country I can find better ones from midprice places. Crystal was quite good, steak house had good steaks, Brazilian one was real dissappointment. Japanese one we did not try. Way of reserving the table is horrifying. Imagine waking up and running to table reservation at 8:30 am in 5 star hotel, no thank you! But luckily that is not the real life. We were able to reserve tables to each restaurant later in the afternoon. They were not full at all. Shows: I heard people complementing them at breakfast table and I wondered why, to me the were really boring. The latin music band on our first night was good, otherwise everything was so amateur. Beach: The beach is wonderfull. Best part of this hotel. So clean and nice. But again, some small detail: the drinks from the bar at the beach does not really have practically any alcohol in them. Of course some people may say that you are not meant to get drunk there. But I rather have my drink as I order it and then drink water in between. Into 0,5 litres of thermomug they will put about 1-1,5 cl of alcohol, practically nothing. When you mention this they will add one drop more. This applies especially the guy who is in charge of the place. Once when I got a drink made by another guy it had normal amount of alcohol. Service at beach works, you will get those water down drinks directly to the beach. That is nice if you are happy with juices and watered beer. Personnel: Everyone except the guy at the beach bar are really service oriented and nice. Summa summarum: Place is really nice if you expect 3-4 stars. Even though I give a lots of critic here we did enjoy our stay. And if the price was right we might stay there again, assuming we would go to same location another time. But since the place claims to be the 5 start I feel obliged to tell you the truth of these little details that takes stars away from this place. Just have right expecations and you will enjoy it a lot.", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indiana", "Title": "\u201cGreat Food!\u201d", "Author": "PandPIndiana", "ReviewID": "UR123615784", "Content": "A group of 10 visited this Riu property and we were not disappointed.

The noise around the pool and the shouting for volleyball and bingo to name a few, we thought we had arrived at a 3 star hotel. It wouldn't have been so bad if the children had stayed in the pools reserved for them for they don't. The food on Christmas Eve was lovely but it went downhill from there on. After complaining about the corked wine on numerous occasions and getting nowhere we complained to the people on the front desk. We were then subjected to a very rude restaurant manager who said we should have told him! which we already had done. Also having to queue in the morning from 8O'Clock to get a ticket to go into the speciality restaurants in my opinion is not 5 star. If you are too late you just don't get to go in them. The shows were good in the evening, but after they finish at 10.30 there is absolutely nothing to do. By the end of the 2 weeks we were very bored. We did go into Playa del Carmen to eat on numerous occasions, the food was very good but expensive.

Owning a travel agency has allowed me to visit many different resorts and the RIU's are ranked among my favorites. We traveled with 10 people, 4 rooms and we were placed together in rooms 0108 - 0112 as requested at check in. Our rooms faced the resort next door and had a view of the workers from that resort but we didn't spend much time in the room and the view doesn't really make or break a vacation for me so it was fine. All rooms have 2 beds in them. You can pull them apart or push them together to make 1 king or 2 separate beds. My only complaint with the rooms is that the beds and pillows are extremely hard for my liking but we were so tired that even if we were sleeping on concrete, we would have slept like a rock. The resort itself is beautiful and the beach no longer has the large \"sand whales\" and is breath taking. The restaurants were all wonderful and we never went away hungry from any of them. The drink service at the pool was wonderful and there were usually chairs to be found until around 10am. The only disappointment with the pools were that there are no stairs leading into any pool and they are not very large. One person in our party is disabled and they were only able to enter the pool 1 time during our 7 nights due to the difficulty of entering and exiting without stairs. It is also quite a long walk over the beach to the ocean for anyone with a disability. Our only other disappointment was that there was no chicken man at this resort. Previously, at a RIU in Jamaica, there was a gentleman grilling chicken everyday on the beach at noon for lunch and we were told this took place at all of the RIU resorts but RIU Mexico had never heard of this before. Again, this didn't break the vacation as we never went hungry. There is no disco on site but across the street at a sister resort. Just a bit of an inconvenience. There are not a lot of activities going on around the pool so it is very relaxing. The resort is welcoming and friendly.

Older people or the handicap would really have a tough time with this. We resorted to walking in the grass to avoid falling. Overall, I liked this resort and would stay here again.

We have stayed here before in 2004 and once again we loved it! We went from Wed. to Wed. When we arrived we were met at check-in and given a cold drink. Check-in was very quick. Our room was not quite ready so they asked us to come back in 15 minutes. We changed into our bathing suits and went to check things out. It was just as we remembered, beautiful! A little while later we went to our room and it was ready, even had a towel animal holding a flower, hanging from the bedpost. Nice touch. The first day we left a note with $5.00 in the fridge, asking for lots of beer. Every day they made sure there were at least 10 beers. The room overlooked the court yard, right above the theatre. It is sort of loud but they quit at 11:00. The rooms are a little outdated but it was spotless. The person who cleaned our room did a great job, always leaving lots of towels and soap. Breakfast was great, omelette made to order, lots of bacon and mimosas. Our waiter at breakfast and the lunch buffet was Francisco. He is a good guy, hard worker. After breakfast we went to the theater to make reservations for the steakhouse. We did not have to wait in line at all. We made a 6:30 reservation for that night. It was very good. They serve a platter of seafood as an appetizer. The service was excellent. The rest of the time we went to the buffet at 8:30 for dinner. I must give mention to Rafael in the dining room. He always made a point of stopping at our table to ask how we were. Good food, great service from our dinner waiter, German. Homemade soup every day, big salad bar, we even had turkey one night. The beach is awesome, very big, lots of room and lots of chairs. We did not use the pool but it looked very nice. The resort is in a great location, close to Playa Del Carmen and Fifth Ave. We walked into town one day and one night. Did some shopping and sight seeing and then took a taxi back. It was only $7.00.

I would recommend it and had an overall positive impression, but I probably wouldn't return. I'll explain why. On the positive side, the food was very good for an all-inclusive. I've been to about 7 different all-inclusives in Riviera Maya, and this one had some of the best overall food quality. The Brazilian, Japanese, and Steak House restaurants were all very good. The breakfast buffet was great - ask for \"espresso\" if you want stronger coffee (the regular coffee is weak). The grounds are beautiful with the fountains, palm trees, architecture of the buildings, etc. Our room was quite big with two full beds pushed together to form one huge bed that was bigger than a king. The mattress was comfortable. There's a separate seating area with a couch and TV. Our bathroom was big with a tub/shower and separate toilet area. Our fridge was always stocked with bottled water, beer, and soda. You have your own bottles of liquor on the wall which is really cool! The shows at night were actually very good and the dancers in the \"Las Vegas\" show were excellent. The \"Mayan History\" show was also very high quality. There was a band that would play in an open courtyard every night before the formal show at 9:45 pm. The staff and service was very good. There was free basic internet service near the front desk. We were within walking distance to downtown Playa del Carmen - it was about a 25 minute walk, or maybe 2-3 miles. There's also a little shopping area right across the street from the resort. The ocean at the beach has crystal blue water which is beautiful, no rocks, and very little seaweed. Now for the negatives - I found the pool area to be quite small for the size of this resort. It was very loud at the pool all day and there were no \"quiet\" areas like I've found at other resorts. The working crew at the pool try to make it fun but it was loud and obnoxious every day, like a spring break party (at the pool). The beach is very nice, but the chairs were always full very early. I found the resort's beach area to be quite small compared to other resorts I've been to. On the first day of our trip, we were not able to get chairs on the beach until after 3:00 in the afternoon. So for the rest of our trip, my husband would go down and save beach chairs with towels and shoes at 9:00 in the morning. Because everyone was packed so tightly on the beach, we were also very close to smokers, loud talkers, and other annoying people (topless) on the beach each day. I also found the drinks to be very weak, and a few times I had a pina colada that tasted like coconut water. Oh, and the maids start cleaning really early. There were mornings that we heard tons of noise as early as 7:00 in the morning. Another morning a worker was using a very loud drill in the hallway outside our room, and it was quite early. I would suggest bringing earplugs if you're a light sleeper. Don't get me wrong - it's a very nice resort and I feel positive about it overall. I suppose I've been spoiled because I like the resorts in Playa that are really, really big. I've stayed at the Valentin Imperial Maya, Moon Palace, and the Iberostar complex and they are huge - almost like a small city. I really prefer that because I don't feel confined. But if you don't mind a smaller resort with a really packed pool and beach area, then you will like it here. Oh last thing - I highly recommend tipping the staff at meals.

Even though Riu Yucatan considered lower class then Palace, the facilities at Yucatan was much more modern with better layout -Beverage Service (again comparing to what I saw at Riu Yucatan) - at Palace Mexico your options are either get drink of your choice at the bar, sit down at the beach restaurant or get one from the waiter walking around on the beach with limited selection of drinks. At Yucatan, you have all of the above mentioned choices, but there is also a self-serve area in one of the poolside restaurants, where you can get soft drinks, juices, beer, wine, tea and various coffee drinks without any wait. I found myself making a lot of trips to Yucatan for coffee.", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cWonderful!\u201d", "Author": "nurse64pw", "ReviewID": "UR122839790", "Content": "What a beautiful property!

The hotel and the grounds immaculate. What a feast for the eyes, and during the holidays it was impecably decorated...I felt like I was in Paris. However, there is always room for improvement, and mine would be the beds! There is some kind of plastic mattress cover which makes noise as you move and holds too much heat. Also the pillows were flat, nonfeather military issue...but thankfully after a full day of activities, we all slept well. The airconditioner worked wonderfully, we were on the top floor. Surprising too was the fact that the pool bar closed at 6pm. This made for a crowded piano bar at times, but in retrospect I am glad, because the noise level from the pool area was greatly diminished at nightfall.

The food in the restaurants is of a very high standard with a Mexican twist.I would agree with other reviewers re the slight hassle in having to make the reservation but this was only really noticeable when the hotel was busy.We enjoyed the Brazillian and Japenese,Krystals was okay and certainly worth trying. The cleanliness was exception and our maid did a great job of cleaning the room every day.We did receive an upgrade after I enquirerd how much it would cost to move,when asked why I just said the room we had overlooked the kitchen roof.The room in question was on the 2nd floor just over the entertainment area,if you went on the balcony there was a slight smell of cooking and a great view of a palm tree.I would add it wasn't a major problem but the way Riccardo handled it was in our view going above and beyond it made our holiday that much more enjoyable. I really cannot fault the whole hotel and yes as some reviewers have said if you look very hard you can find fault with some aspects of the appearance I certainly wouldn't call it tired though.

The beach is a great a long white stretch great for long walks ( and you can walk to town along the water) , the water depth graduates slowly - so good for children and there is a very large palm tree shaded area for people who prefer to stay out the sun. The main negative for this hotel is that the pool is poorly designed. The food was excellent with a good variety . The hotel is a quiet one, middle age - and older clientel generally.We also went to the other (newer) palace down the street - it has a grander feel, a pool that is laid out better and what you'd expect at a higher end resort and a younger crowd . Walking to Playa del Carmen is about 30 mins. Playacar is a very safe feeling area with tourists walking the main street amongst the hotels and the residential area.

Arrival check in at 3pm smooth & efficient. Staffed by at least 6 persons. English spoken by all and very helpful front desk staff during entire stay. Room- garden view, booked and received. Hotel was at full occupancy no upgrades available. The superior courtyard view rooms are the same but with a much nicer view. Some jr. Suites have balconies which are high concrete so if sitting out on the balcony you're viewing the wall. If you enjoy sitting on the balcony upgrade to courtyard or suite. Beds are two doubles or king, step down to small sitting area which has a sofa. Did not use room service due to the view from the balcony. Older furniture, wc with separate toilet/bidet. Cleanliness - I've inspected 100's of hotels and this hotel receives the top award. Even the wc by the pool.beach were always spotless and dry. Restaurants - buffet excellent with a large variety to please any palet. No problems in getting a table for any of the meals. Dishes are replenished continusly so 5 out of 5. Service by waiters excellent and friendly. Coffee pots left on table at breakfast time..congratulations to the restaurant manager! A-la-carte: reservations required only same day and start at 8am. Lime -up does move fairly quickly. Steakhouse- 1 out of 5. Steaks tough,service poor as the restaurant is understaffed. 6 tables at one sitting. Didn't try the other a la carte as generally speaking I'm not a fan of the riu palaces a la carte restaurants, buffet meals are much better quality. For the record I do prefer a la carte, therefore if this is your preference I'd suggest another hotel. Entertainment-typical all inclusive calibre - not much to write about, dance numbers..I've seen better but I've seen worse id say 3 out of 5 Beach- excellent in all ways 5 out of 5. Plenty of beach lounge chairs no need to save, always plenty available. Nice to sit under palm trees or palapas, your choice. Pool- relatively small for this size resort but ok. Not a grand pool area but with a swim up bar and plenty of games. Bar service decent. The loungers immediately around the pool are saved but there's always space. Long beach for walking, Playa del Carmen is 35min leisure walk. Family- this is not a family resort for small children. Although there's a children's area not many children unless it's school break time. I'd suggest another resort. Gym-small indoors older machines Overall - I would say a 4 out of 5 ..management receives hi marks, hotel was freshly reprinted, rooms need an upgrade. I would return again for overall quality. As you are able to visit the other rip hotels,the Riu Yucatan is next door, Tequila across the street which has the disco, Playacar 2 hotels over and the newer Riu Palace Riviera Maya is 10min walk. The staff and service at the Riu Palace Mexico was much better. There's more palms then at Riviera maya but the building/rooms were nicer at the riviera maya. Weddings- did not witness any,which is unusual as destination weddings are extremely popular. There's a small chapel off of the lobby for very small weddings.

I've stayed with Riu before, but not at a Palace. In the future I will only stay at a Riu Palace!! This trip was with my 2 teens & myself. I requested (and got) an extra bed in our room - I was a little concerned that it was going to be an uncomfortable rollaway - NOT! In fact, I slept <well> on this \"extra\" bed. Tho not an Adults Only resort, there were very few children at the resort - most were well behaved tweens/teens with their families - small children (mostly) were also well behaved. Quite a few larger extended family groups (Christmas vacation) RPM does have a limited kids program - probably amped up for the holidays. I would go to another resort if you have kids (so they have other kids to play with). WOW - the other reviews apparently didn't go to the same resort we went to!! I found front desk staff to be quite pleasant & helpful. Our room 2134 was fantastic! Top floor - Overlooking fountains & even could see Caribbean over palm trees (there are no beach front rooms at RPM). AC only works when sliding glass door is closed. It's going to take some decent running & swimming to remove what I added from dining at RPM!!! We ate at all the ala cartes (some a couple times) and Don Julio buffet for bfast & dinner plus the pool buffet El Patio (& some other name) for lunch. Yes, a little slow in the morning capaccino delivery. I just get up early in the AM, so no problems making ala carte reservations - even with a full resort. Animation staff - Cindy, Aida, Freddy & Dedi were very lots of fun to play with - BINGO @4 was on the calendar for everyday (almost) - they ask you to participate if you want - all seem to truely enjoy guests & making things fun! I felt they really went out of their way to make sure people were having fun. Pool bartender Mundo **EXCELLENT SERVICE** with a friendly smile! Thank you! Wait staff around pool always ready to offer another drink. Drink service on beach limited to what was on the tray - I'd rather get up & order my own drink - plus get a LITTLE exercise!) Evening show at RPM was lame - we walked across the street to Riu Tequila which IMHO had a better show. Went into PDC several times - to CoCo BONGO & NYE - plus some daytime shopping. Never had a problem finding a chair around the pool or at the beach - sometimes we had to \"pull\" it to our desired location - very little \"towel game\" here. Ironically we also went to Riu Palace Riviera Maya where the pool \"towel game\" was in full play!! I did like the RPRM pool/beach set up a little better. Parasailed, jet skiied & did snorkeling excursion with Scuba Caribe (the water sports guys \"associated\" with Riu) - they are friendly and helpful in making suggestions that might work best with your group. Snorkeling was especially fun - followed sea turtle for awhile! My daughter painted ceramics & the guy at the booth tricked it out & sealed it overnight - nice touch! Also went to Coba wity Yucatreks - they are a great outside excursion company - book directly on line. Fun one day off property trip. An environmental beef - do you really need to serve a straw with every drink?? I thought that was a little wasteful. Riu staff did a great job keeping beach cleaned up, straightened up chairs every night.. raking sea weed... These guys work really hard! Resort is scheduled for some kind of rennovation this fall - hmmmm - well the couch in our room was well used, curtains a bit dated - but certainly fine with me.

Thomson customers have the fountain facing rooms, so check before you travel. Travelling as a group with teenagers and an elderly mother we requested ground floor rooms close together. Our request was not passed on to the hotel by the Thomas Cook Nat West travel service and therefore we ended up on the 3rd floor with no lift access. At check in when we requested ground floor rooms the desk staff were far from helpful and one young lady was positively rude, smirking and showing a complete lack of concern at our circumstances. Worst ever check in experience! Tired from the long journey we finally accepted one ground floor room with one large bed, which was not exactly ideal for my mother, daughter and niece to share. Unfortunately the poor attitude of the staff was not restricted to the checkin desk. On the second day we were on the beach when the heavens opened and the only shelter was the beach restaurant. As they were not open for lunch they would not even allow anyone to enter the restaurant and sit down at the tables, making everyone huddle in a small area which was lashed with rain. After about 15 minutes we could return to the beach only for the heavens to open again 30 minutes later and this time even though it was 5 mins before opening the restaurant staff would still not allow us in. We experienced service issues in the beach restaurant, not only in obtaining drinks, but when 9 of us wanted to sit at a table they would only push together two tables and cram us around with the table legs in the way. Not exactly the treatment I would expect from a hotel of this standard. The only place in the hotel where you could get a decent coffee was the Lobby bar and unbelievably they had a shortage on tea spoons. We also had an incident with a waiter in this bar when we changed our mind and added some additional drinks, he rolled his eyes in annoyance. If you wanted a coffee at breakfast without sugar the waiters took 15 mins to produce half a cup as they had a problem with the cappuccino machine. Again always a shortage of teaspoons in this restaurant. The grounds are lovely and the rooms are huge but the view from our room was terrible, just some bushes and part of the neighbouring hotel buildings. The beach is beautiful and you can walk all the way to Playa del Carmen. The entertainment team were terrible. The family joined in a game of volleyball and my daughter was reduced to tears by one of the entertainment team shouting. No one explained the rules and following this experience no one in our group would attempt to join any further activities. As you walked along the beach all the other hotels had activities on the beach, with games and dancing etc., but at this hotel the option was volleyball, stretching or horseshoes. A once a week beach party lasted for exactly 45 minutes so get there quick or it will be gone and you are left with just the BBQ. The evening shows were poor and we ventured to the neighbouring Riu hotels for an atmosphere in the evening or into Playa del Carmen We went to Xel Ha for the day which was brilliant and also had a couple of evenings at Co Co Bongo which was excellent fun. We booked a trip with our Thomas Cook rep to Coba which she confirmed would leave at 8am and take 50 minutes to get there. It was brought forward to 7.20am and took over 2 hours to get there, which was totally unacceptable. Who wants to spend 4 hours on a coach! This trip was totally mis sold by the Thomas Cook rep, so beware. The water sports center on the beach was so unprofessional. We booked a snorkelling trip and they did not have enough masks. The equipement was very poor and not ready when we arrived and their main concern was gettting you to sign the Waiver. The boat was so noisey you had a severe headache before you got to the reef, but we did see a turtle which was fantastic.

The resort did not feel cramped and the mix was definitely towards an older crowd (with families mixed in here and there). Other Riu's catered more to the younger crowds and were very busy...with more energy. * Food...plenty of choices. No awards though. Brekky buffet is probably the best. Dinner reservations are made between 8-10:30AM...but get there early as dinner at the better restaurants go quickly. Gentlemen must wear pants. In fact, this is a very well dressed set of guests. You can go more casual of course, but you can also feel free to step it up. * Service is inconsistent. Sometimes it was spot on. Other times, it was wanting. Other Riu's have soda dispensing stations so as to not have to rely on service members. This made everything slower than it could have been...especially in the more casual atmospheres. * Rooms are traditional, but tired in decor. Rooms were cleaned well with a turn-down service at night. JR Suites face out to adjacent hotel properties. Suites facing into courtyard would be very preferable as you can then enjoy people watching as the day winds down. * Room temperature was good. Mini-bar was well stocked with water, sodas, beer, and had access to liquor. * Bathrooms were decent size...needed more light. Tub shower...with mold...disappointing. Separate toilet with bidet. No fan. * No room or pool/beach internet access. Must go to lobby for access. * Grounds are beautiful and well maintained. The most impressive aspect of the resort. * Pool was good but not very big. Pool bar...water volleyball. Jacuzzi was without heat...just bubbles. Get to the pool early to get the best location...we got there at 7:30 to secure our spot. * You cannot see the beach/ocean from the pool or the hotel. The beach was good and clean. Lots of activities. * Location is 25-30 minute walk from Playa's 5th Avenue...or $7 cab ride. * Connect with an onsite travel reservationist quickly so as to book regional activities. My recommendation is Olympus and ask for Elizabeth. She gave us a straight advice on a number of activities by asking very good questions about what we wanted to accomplish as a family. I had high expectations which were not lived up to relative to value for money. With that said, we had a good trip and you could have done far worse. Not...we had friends stay at the Riu Maya Riviera. They had a very similar experience. In looking at the two, the Maya is a bit closer to town, a bit more updated in decor, bigger, and better facilities.

I loved that it was a gated resort community (with homes and condos in addition to large hotels) so I had no qualms about going out for a run or just exploring. You can also take a long walk down the beach to get to Playa del Carmen (or just take a cab but I thought the beach was a nicer route....) Not an ideal place for a solo traveler, though, as everyone was there with SOs or families. Also, my room was overlooking the central courtyard and over the main lounge, so there was entertainment going on every night. I was fine with being right in the heart of the action and they're good at cutting it off at 11 PM each night, but if you want to go to bed early, make sure you ask for a location that's a little farther out on each of the wings.

I would definitely recommend this particular RUI and I briefly visited the Palace Riviera Maya (stunning lobby!) and the RUI Tequilla (right across the street), which both seemed pretty nice. All five Playacar RUIs are pretty close together and it really expands your options if you take advantage of the others.

An excellent choice of hotel for your stay in Playa del Carmen. Exceptionally clean and smart hotel with very friendly staff who went out of their way to serve you and make you feel special during your stay. This hotel will not disappoint, it is great. The rooms are large and comfortable with big firm beds, air con, optics and fridge and coffee machine, with free safe deposit box, steam iron & board, extra blankets and pillows, flat screen TV and sofa area. The sofa was a bit tired, however, and had seen better days. Tiled floors and well stocked bathroom with hairdryer & a good shower over the bath. Why do the Americans keep going on about lights in the shower ? Don\u2019t they realise that leccy and water don\u2019t mix ? It\u2019s not rocket science is it and it\u2019s not that dim \u2013 my advice - do things by touch and feel ! Towels are plentiful and replaced daily if required. Friendly and unobtrusive maid service with sheets changed frequently over our 2 week stay and nice towel art touches to welcome you back to your room. Reception team are very friendly and helpful and make a big thing of contacting all guests at the start of the holiday \u2013 notes and information delivered to your room on a frequent basis introducing themselves and letting you know what services they provide. Senior management all very visible and interactive with guests and introduced themselves personally during our stay which is a nice touch. Being Riu Class members doesn\u2019t seem to bring much in the way of benefits even when you are approaching Diamond Class but the points will all add up for future stays. All inclusive at the Palace allows you to use all 5 Riu hotels in the resort for drinks, meals & facilities (except your evening meal) and even further a field in Cancun where we went exploring one day and popped in to the Riu Palace Las Americas for our lunch ! Meals at the Riu Palace Mexico are amazing, the choice in the buffet restaurant is huge \u2013 the first week you will try everything \u2013 by the second week you will be back to just tea and toast for breakfast as you will be stuffed. Just watch, however, as everything comes with added sugar in it, even pure fruit juices; and coffee lovers will do well to ask the waiters for \u201cespresso\u201d coffee from the machine rather than the stuff that is served from the flasks. They also like their salt in their food so no need to add more \u2013 taste first ! Food in the buffet was great \u2013 Beef Wellington, Duck, Prawns, Beef, Turkey, salads, cheese, pizza, pasta, choice is amazing and the ice cream is lovely too ! The themed speciality restaurants were all great quality and all well worth trying as they all provided excellent dining experiences \u2013 look out for Speedy Gonzales in the Brazillian and even if you don\u2019t fancy Japanese do try it as it will surprise you in a good way ! Don\u2019t understand the comments about problems with booking as this was by far the easiest and best resort for doing this, never a queue and always got what we wanted apart from one night in the Krystal but we were put top of the list for the following evening which was great service. Drinks improve as the day lengthens\u2026.the pool & beach bars serve good quality drinks but the alcohol content is minimal \u2013 which is probably just as well \u2013 the quality improves in the lobby bar and in the speciality restaurants during the evening and the service is superb \u2013 we didn\u2019t even have to ask, Danny would remember our favourite tipples and ensure they were delivered to our table as soon as we appeared. The pool area is well maintained and clean \u2013 the pool itself was exceptionally clean and there were always plenty of loungers and parasols free. The grounds are immaculate although the tiles were very slippery when wet so care is needed when walking around the grounds after a shower of rain. This hotel has a European flavour to it \u2013 calm, quieter, relaxed, less noise and bustle with mainly European guests \u2013 its sister hotel the Riu Palace Riviera Maya \u2013 just ten minutes down the road, has a livelier edge to it. Bigger pool scene, more going on, animation, more American and Canadian orientated. As you can use all the Riu hotels you can take your pick and swap and change scenes as you feel like it, one of the great advantages of staying in the Riu chain at this resort. Hotel facilities are fine \u2013 decent gym (a bit small but ok) and spa with mix of cardio and weights and the staff are really helpful and accommodating of your needs. Free wi-fi access in the lobby and bar area for all your Pods & Pads which will easily fit in the safe while you\u2019re not using them. Beach area is clean and tidy \u2013 nice relaxing hammock area, plenty of sun and shade to suit all tastes and water sport activities a plenty, lifeguards on duty and clearly marked flag system for safety. Top tips and advice from Crozzer: You can use American Dollars or Mexican Pesos throughout Mexico \u2013 with 20 Pesos to the British Pound \u2013 I would probably just opt for using the Peso as you seemed to be able to negotiate a slightly better deal when using the Mexican currency. There is an exit tax of \u00a340 payable at the airport on departure or you can pay in Dollars or Pesos \u2013 put it in your passport at the beginning of the holiday ! Excursions and trips can be booked locally without any problems \u2013 haggle down the prices and get yourself a good deal \u2013 the Chichen Itza trip is a very long day but we did it for about \u00a345 each which was good value. Coba is also worthwhile as you can still climb the pyramids there and get above the jungle canopy. If there are 4 or more of you the cheapest way of getting out and about is to hire a taxi for the day. Do visit a few Cenotes as they are fascinating for a swim and a welcome way to freshen up from the heat of the day. Over the road from the hotel there are shops and kiosks \u2013 even a Starbucks - where you can arrange your local tours \u2013 go and find Victor and haggle him down to around 40 to 50 pounds per trip per person per day. On departure they are strict on luggage weight limited to only 20KG so plan ahead if you want to buy things but they didn\u2019t seem too bothered about weighing hand luggage so it wasn\u2019t too much bother. Tipping is very much down to the individual and tends to be a culture thing \u2013 the Americans tip, the Europeans not as much \u2013 its not demanded or expected but appreciated when you do. Tip when the service you receive goes beyond your expectations. I wasn\u2019t particularly bothered by Mozzies \u2013 only 2 bites in 2 weeks so no problems there even in the jungle ! It is rather humid though so I found some medicated talc very handy to keep my bits that rub from getting chapped and sore ! Shopping is good but don\u2019t expect very cheap prices, they are not daft, but the quality of most things appears OK \u2013 lovely jewellery, silver wear and semi precious stones, good quality cotton shirts and leather boots, Mexican blankets and everyone wears a hat ! The resort is very safe and there is no problem walking into Playa del Carmen \u2013 about 3km from the hotel takes 25 minutes at a leisurely stroll \u2013 take a walk down 5th Avenue for all your shopping needs, souvenirs, cigars, silver wear, hats, sports wear, designer shops etc and enjoy. To sum up \u2013 a superb holiday and a lovely hotel \u2013 ranks right up there with the best of the Riu Palace hotels for comfort and service.

I thoroughly enjoyed both the buffets, so much so that I only made reservations for one a la carte (normally I try to eat at as many as I can). Food was hot, had a good variety, plus theme nights. A good variety of liquor and non alcoholic options. The chocolate martini is to die for. The entertainment staff were a bit pushy, but given that I'm around their age I think they \"bugged\" me a bit more than others.

I didn't watch many of the shows at night, but I did enjoy the music before and after from the band. I usually went over to the Riu Tequila across the street.

The Riu Palace Mexico is in Playacar and about 30-40 minute walk to the town of Playa del Carmen. The resort has beautifully maintained landscaping with fountains in the central courtyard. Our junior suite was very large with the TV and sofa down one step from the bed. Large closet space with mini bar and in-room safe. The one thing that we found very uncomfortable was the sofa - it was very low and we stacked pillows from the bed to sit on while we watched TV. The bathroom was also large with the toilet and bidet in a separate room with a sliding door. The bathtub area was very dark but otherwise a lovely bathroom. The resort is on an excellent beach. A thick row of trees separates the main buildings from the beach so there were many choices to lounge in the shade if you wanted out of the direct sun. We never had a problem getting beach chairs either around the pool or on the beach. We did go to water aerobics one day - the pool was on the \"cool\" side but we got used it after jumping around for a few minutes. I did not like that the pool has no wide steps gradually leading into the pool. Only access was by the vertical ladders which could pose a problem for mobility challenged people or children. I liked that the towel shack by the pool also had a small free library as I had already read the books I brought before arriving at this resort. We ate at 4 a la carte restaurants - Japanese, Fusion, Steakhouse and Brazilian. We had a very good meal at all 4 restaurants. We could only book the a la carte restaurants on the day we wanted the reservation. This was a bit inconvenient since we had to make sure we were there at 800am promptly when reservations opened. If we went at 830am most of the restaurants were already full for the early sitting (630pm). One piece of literature we received said that the reservations opened at 830am not 800am so it took a couple of days before we wised up.

There is plenty of alcohol. The sparkling wine from Spain is actually quite decent; I cannot comment on the other wine. I liked the Banana Martini too!! The specialty restaurants are nice for a change of pace, but beware the food is lousy. The rooms are very comfy. My one complaint is that the shower is dark. The tub is nice, but it is difficult to get in and out of if you are short. I always needed to grab onto the wall to get in or out. The maid service keeps the rooms spotless. I left a 2 dollar tip each day. I gave a 1 dollar tip at the bar for a round of drinks. Additionally I left the waiters at the buffet one dollar per person at meals.

We've also stayed at the Riu Palace in the Bahamas (nice too). We booked thru Riu.com and got a great price including non-stop with Jet Blue and transfers. Arriving after about a 45 min.ride to this gated community, check in was a snap, received a refreshing drink and were told to come back at 2 when the room would be ready. We had lunch and walked around and by 2 were unpacked in our room. The room was the standard \"suite\" with 2 queen beds together. Firm but not as hard as we had feared. Sleeping was never a problem and we are spoiled with a great mattress at home. We had a 2nd floor with walled balcony (no real view but nice tree tops). Very clean rooms. Yes, a bit dated but lovely just the same. The grounds are awesome and the beach and pool had plenty of shade or sun, and getting a chair was never a problem. Food was above average for an all-inclusive. Like many have said, if you can't find something you like, something's wrong with you! I'm longing for a huge plate of fresh papaya I had each morning. Omelets made to order, smoothies, anything. The sausage etc. were not great so we learned to skip those calories. For dinner and lunch they would have a great selction of salad makings, pasta stations, etc. and plenty of choices for anything from tacos to soups (excellent tortilla soup!) . We tried the specialty restaurants and they were good and a nice change. Don't expect 5 star. Service was above average every where, from the swim up bar to the restaurants. They work hard so if you can, throw them a tip. We would tip at least a dollar with every drink, a few for lunch or dinners, at the specialty restaurants $10 or so. Tip - the coffee is fairly weak, so order a double expresso - after a couple days we would be served this automatically at breakfast - nice!. And when you want to drink, ask for their \"best tequila\" or your preferred vodka - while they don't have every top brand, they have a pretty good selection and will pour you whatever you want. It was fun to try the water aerobcs, volley ball and target practice - good way to meet people and you'll work off at least half a drink. Maybe. The evening entertainment we found better than we have seen in other resorts. They have a nice variety and it's so pretty sitting out under the stars with the resort all lit up, music playing, a drink in hand. The weather was nice - 82 during the day, 72 at night. Cannot beat that. It rained a bit while we were in Playa del Camen so we ducked into a place for lunch and by the time we were done so was the rain. Playa is fun and a short cab ride away, or you can walk the beach. We would recommend this resort for relaxation or to be as social as you want or any where in between.

Many of the reviews before me are spot on with the details of the property. If this is your first trip to RPM you will likely be pleased, if you are a repeat guest you will be disappointed. The hotel is worn and will have a renovation next fall, I hope they do it right, and will look foward to reviews after their Dec 1st reopening. We liked the place well enough the first time to book it again (we stay very few places more than once or twice). We got an awesome price of $184 per night for the room, just a few bucks more than what they wanted for the Riu Yucatan next door. My wife's sister and husband were staying in a courtyard view room and we requested a room near them. They set us up in a room across the hall, it took them a few hours to get it clean, and when we first got in it the doors were open and the floor was slightly wet, sticky in places and slick as ice in others. It felt like the ac wasnt working so I asked for another room. The room they showed me was what I think we actually paid for....it was a smaller room with no step down to the couch area, had a chipped tub, and some non working lights. So there are more room types than courtyard or garden view. We were told these were our only two rooms available, that the hotel was full, and no new rooms were available untill the next day. (Personally I think many mexican AI hotels lie about available rooms, hoping you will take the crappy room they have clean and be too lazy to change rooms later.) We waited a couple of hours and the ac finally dried the floors and caught up enough to cool the room to a temperature we could sleep in. We had a view of the fence and backside of the hotel next door, so we kept the drapes closed most of the time. We had a leak from the ceiling because of the AC one night, which was promptly fixed. We also had a few bugs drawn to the water leak, which i stomped. Didnt see any afterwards. The couch in our room felt like elephants had used it as a trampoline....totally worn out, it felt like you were sitting 6 inches off the floor and was hard to get up from it after you sank in its worn out springs and cushions. The bed (2 pushed together to make a king) was comfortable enough, even though it was probably worn out too. Most Riu beds start out hard as rocks, the elephants must have softened it up for us. The tv was a small flat screen 32\"?..but it did have HDMI jacks that allowed me to plug in my tablet and watch some concerts i recorded from youtube, instead of 3 stooges in spanish which translated surprisingly well. LOL We didnt care too much about the room, because we were only there to sleep, shower and change. As long as it has a good bed, AC, working TV and bathroom we are happy. We used my in-laws patio a couple of times for the view of the fountains, which was nice but not worth the extra $$$ in my opinion. Unless you get an extended period of rain you never sit in the room that long anyway. The whole hotel was looking as old as the majority of it's guests. so many tiles in the hallways were chipped or repaired they need to replace more than half of them. The tile walkways near the fountains get slick as ice when wet, this does not go well with the elderly clientelle, they need some tile with texture. The pools need to be drained and cleaned/ regrouted. They need plastic tables on the beach to keep drinks out of the sand. The other palace had plenty, as well as some pads for the beach chairs, RPM only had pads on the pool chairs. This trip beach service was plentiful, unless there was a wedding, I think they use the extra waiters to help for events because there was no beach service whenever a wedding was set up. Our last trip there there was plenty of pool service and practically no beach service. This time it was reversed. Now to my biggest gripe, the food and drink. I know it is a subjective subject and I am no foodie with 5star expectations. I am just comparing what we got this time to what we got on our previous stay. Last time they had Grey Goose vodka at the RPM and Absolute at the other Riu's...this time Absolute at the palace and Smirnoff at the others...this must have happened over a year ago because the menus had changed. The menus at all the Riu's still showed Havana Club Rums (a couple of kinds) even though none of their resorts have had this brand for a couple of months....Get new menus before you get rid of the brand!!...it just reminded me of what I was missing. (Havana Club was my favorite last stay) Last time they also had Classic 12 (aged canadian club) under the bar. It too was gone. The lobby bar had an annoying system of 1 guy taking your order, the bartender making it, and a random waiter/waitress delivering it to you....it made it hard to know who to tip and sometimes caused long delays in getting a drink....sometimes it was easier to go to the bar and get it yourself. The staff were all very good and mostly friendly, we saw many of the same faces from two years ago. It was one of the few things that had not changed for the worse. Free wifi in the lobby was a nice addition but was down for a couple of days, during which time we were told to go to the tequilla and use theirs...I think they should have made it available through the pay for use guy who always had a signal (for a price) Riu could have compensated him for thier slack....or they could have offered us the option of using our Riu class points to pay the guy, like we had to do last stay. Riu Class points= worthless. The food.....The buffet is still the best choice for variety, but had less choices than the last stay. Last time the theme nights were bigger and used the area by the main entrance as a cooking station for whatever food was featured. Last time we had a few upscale choices, beef wellington for example...this stay we had 1 memorable night with giant prawns and lots of seafood choices, I don't think it was coincidence that this was the dinner they handed out the satisfaction surveys afterwards. The next day they had the leftover shrimp and it was about the same choices. The food is better than the other Riu's and I think that is the main reason you pay more for the Palace....I'm just not sure it is worth the premium anymore. The buffet has about 3/4 the choices it did 2 years ago......They still have some of the best ice cream, the butter pecan tastes almost homemade. The entertainment was ok, but the music was geared to the 60+ crowd If you like Lawrence Welk and Benny Goodman this is your place...other than the piano guy in the lobby bar there was hardly any house music to be heard in the bars or near the pool. It might annoy the staff to listen to the same recorded Muzak, but even Mexican radio would have been better than the stuffy silence that was common. It felt like you should whisper in the lobby bar because it was most always quiet. We went across to Riu Tequilla a few times to listen to music and party after the RPM shut down for the night (usually around 11pm) There are no TV's in the public areas at RPM, we had to go to the sports bar at Tequilla to watch a football game, they also have a fridge there with sandwiches and snacks that you can take back to the room...The only option for after hours food at the RPM is room service, and the choices are fewer than they used to be. I wouldnt be surprised if they run across the road to tequilla and get your sandwich from the fridge in the sports bar...the other palace has a similar sports bar on property and has more amenities than the RPM. The landscaping was well maintained and looked as good as last time, the beach was nicer than last time since the \"beach whales\" are gone, there was hardly any seaweed this time, whereas last time they had crews raking and burying huge amounts of it. They had paint crews working on the outside of the buildings, but they were just looking busy. 1 guy scraping some of the loose stuff that was peeling everywhere and 10 guys painting. When they do the renovation they need 10 guys scraping or sandblasting all the loose stuff off first, then the paint job will last more than a few months. Bottom line is the service and staff are the best reason to stay at the RPM. The food and drink quality is being cut year after year. The furniture and buildings need the upcoming renovation. The manager said she has a wish list, but has no idea of what the Riu people in Spain have planned for the RPM. I hope they spend the money and make the effort to bring this place back to top of the line \"palace\" standards....otherwise it will show that Riu is not interested in competing with luxury brand resorts, and will remain a mid level AI chain with slightly better \"palace\" properties......unless the palaces are much better than the other Riu's there is no reason to pay the extra money. Might as well step up to Iberostar, Sandal's, Breezes, or the original mexican \"palaces\" (ie sunpalace, moonpalace, ect. ect.) These are my gripes and one of the reasons we dont stay at the same place twice (because properties usually get worse over time) Please don't let this review keep you from trying the RPM (expecially after the 12/12 reopening) It is a very nice property for the area, and if your a first time guest I would say you won't regret the choice....other reviews before me highlight the properties good points, and all in all we enjoyed our second stay there. That said, given the choice, until the renovation is over, I would stay at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya down the road...it is a newer and better laid out Palace. Oh, one last thing, we tried the little strip mall across from Riu Playacar and found it a wonderful change from the high pressure sales found on 5th ave. It is an easy walk from either palace. They have tons of stores and not a single shop owner pressured us or bothered us while we looked. It was like night and day from the sales people in town. I might have paid a little more, because I didn't bargain as long as I should have, but I didnt mind because of the lack of pressure from the shopkeepers.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio TX", "Title": "\u201cNice place, but did not meet expectations\u201d", "Author": "foghesino", "ReviewID": "UR121898917", "Content": "I just returned from a 5 day stay at the Riu Palace Mexico 24-hour all-inclusive resort. I was there attending a wedding. As always, I decided to learn more about the property, ammenities and recommendations from other Trip Advisor reviewers. I found most of their comments spot on, and yet, I expected better food, newer accommodations and an overall \"amazing\" experience. Food was subpar and the room, although nicely cleaned and looked-after by staff, felt a bit \"old\" (for example, the layout of having a sunken living room is interesting, but not very handicap accessable or safe, if walking still wet from the pool/beach). Furnitute all around the hotel was not comfortable either (one exception was the courtyard chairs). Staff, specially those in the the entertainment and drinks division were extra nice and helpful. Some of the kitchen staff (serving in different sections of the buffets) were not (they simply seemed as if they hated it being there). Although I do not expect to have WiFi or internet everywhere (that makes it a great excuse to enjoy your time there more) the Riu Palace Hotel only has WiFi availble in the lobby area (and it was down for most of the time I was there). They have a couple of laptops available for a resonable price (40 pesos/hour I believe) but doesn't that defeat the purpose of an \"all-inclusive\"? Food at the speciality retaurants (e.g. steakhouse, japanese, etc.) was the worse: Overcoooked, poor presentation, bad quality, overpretentious. I would recommend the main buffet area (Don Julian) since at least you will find yourself with more choices. As a guest at Riu Palace Mexico, you have access to the other 4 properties near by (also called Riu) and their buffets (don't bother...the food selection is the same, but in less variety). As for the drinks at Riu Palace Mexico: My hats off to them. They have lots of selection (many high brands) and you can ask them to pour you as much or as little as you want (almost to the point of making your own drinks!). The only catch in regards to drinks (but it happens in other all-inclusives) is the size of the cup.

Mini bar in rooms are a nice perk, complete with 4 full bottles of liquor in the dispenser. Plenty of food options on the buffets, can't imagine anyone going hungry, and I'm a picky eater. I didn't think the food quality was stellar, but knowing how much we paid...we couldn't have eaten this well anywhere else for the price. Wide fruity drink selection, but not many beer options.

Turns out there are 6 Riu properties located in this gated community and you have privileges at all of them with your Riu Mexico wristband. This was nice as there was a sports bar and discoteque at the Riu across the street from us. Resort clientele was a mix of families and older couples, some younger couples as well (age 20-40). Not a party atmosphere which is perfect for relaxation. Fitness center was fine, basic but served its purpose.

One week for us was not enough, we were regretting why we did not book the place for at least ten days. Every evening at 8:00 PM they have a show for the kids with prizes, dances and songs. This is followed at 9:45 PM with quality shows for adults in the theater or in the courtyard. They offer a great SPA to do workout, massages, sauna and two whirlpools one hot and the other lukewarm. They also have another whirlpool by the main pool. They have free wi-fi in the lobby area or you can rent a computer to use the internet. The beach is beautiful and spacious where you can rent a jet ski or do some parasailing. They also have hammocks among the palm trees and they do a cook out once a week by the beach. Our room was comfortable and really clean. In fact they come several times during the day to do touch ups or some decorations with the towels or they may throw some petals to decorate. All these little things made us feel that the staff indeed cared for us. They also offer room service at no extra cost in case you may get hungry during the night. You find groups of people from many different countries, especially Germany, Canada, USA, and some other countries in Europe and South America. The great thing about this Palace is that everybody is welcome, and they value you as a guest.", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cExcellent, except the room we had was not\u201d", "Author": "DFWTom", "ReviewID": "UR121835176", "Content": "Make no mistake, this Riu is one of the best resorts we have ever stayed at. Wish we could have been there longer than the 8 days that we were. The food at the specialty restaurants, as well as at both of the buffets were the best we've ever had in Mexico. Heck, we even had a good steak a couple of times while there which was a first for us in Mexico. A wide variety of seafood that was top notch. Good brands of liquors, well made drinks, and always outstanding service with a smile. Always. Entertainment in the evenings were much better than we had ever experienced too. Even compared to some of the other Riu Palaces we have stayed at, this resort scores higher in our book on everything except the room. More on that later. They do require a dress code for men during the evening meal, even at the buffet. No sleeveless shirts or shorts. In many ways we appreciated this and didn't mind dressing up a little before leaving our room for the evenings. If guest didn't pack trousers, they have some that could be borrowed, so fellows bring some. This dress code is only for the evening meal, but shoes/sandals must be worn at any meal, even at the buffet by the beach. Yes, there was some topless women sunbathing in the lounge chairs off of the pool area. I did not see any at the edge of the pool or in the pool - and I was looking for it. The amount of topless sun bathers on the beach was about average for what we have experienced in Mexico in the past. Decor: Hey, its one of their Palace properties so you know it is decked out. Lots of marble and rich wood work throughout. Giant Christmas tree in the lobby. Besides the normal gift stores and desk in the main building, there is also a small Chapel in one corner of the lobby. Elevators on each end of the large lobby are handy to take luggage either up to the top floor, or down to the ground floor. The lobby bar is on the way the way to the double curved stairs leading down to the main Plaza. This lobby bar has a very pleasing 2-3 hours of piano music 5 nights a week. It was a real treat to watch the pianist's facial expressions and body language thanking the applause after each tune. We took advantage of the brand liquors available here for a quiet drink or two each evening before going down to dinner. The lobby bar is open from 10:AM to 7:AM. Why they bother to close for 3 hours is a mystery, but it makes for a good place to get drinks and good coffee during the night. There is a spiral stair leading to an open balcony on one side of the bar, but was closed off every time I was there. Coming down the double curved stairs you come to the main plaza dominated by a huge fountain. Here you will find the main buffet on one side and the theater (with it's own bar) on the other. The Brazillian, Fusion, and Japanese specialty restaurants are here on the ground floor of the main building. On the other side of the plaza is a raised stage area that had some form of live music, always different, each night right before and right after the nightly theater show. This plaza is also the area they had set up for Casino night and Mexican Market night. On Casino night they give you chips that can be used at several different types of gaming tables, then used to bid on items at the end of the evening. Market night is various vendors setting up tables and booths of over priced tourist stuff that you will also see in town, but without the verbal abuse from the vendors on 5th Ave. In the evenings drink service at the tables in the plaza is very fast. I do have to say though that I preferred the vodka tonic mix and the scotch straights from the lobby bar. This area is the gathering place for guest after dark, but usually gets pretty quiet after the dancing and live band is done playing. One night a little after 11:PM we heard a commotion on the other side of the large fountain and turned just in time to see a young man being thrown fully clothed into the water, with 40+ cooks crowded together in their chef's jackets and tall hats laughing and singing to him. We asked the waiter what was happening and he said it a Mexican tradition for the guy's birthday. I had no ideal they had so many people helping to prepare the evening meals. Grounds: Manicured, very visually appealing layout of the 100m long, center court-yard and walks along the fountains. Lit up at night, full of fountains, statues, and pools connecting them. I wasn't surprised at the number of people taking pictures and videos. Little harmless critters wondering around. Full of flowers, trees and bushes, many of them in bloom. Looking down on this from the double curved stairs of the main building is a site worth seeing. These fountains were not working the first two days of our stay. Bummer. The tile on these walkways can become very slick when wet as my wife's bottom found out after just the briefest of showers. Pool: Between the beach area and the fountains, the double sided pool provides a comfortable area to lounge and enjoy a drink from it's bar. Good drink service here too. Water was a little cool when you first got in, but not too bad. You either had to jump in from the side, or climb down a ladder as there were no steps leading into the pool. Both sides (one quiet and the other containing the swim up bar and volley ball area) are shallow and curved. Nice looking flower/plant mosaic incorporated into the bottom with small tiles. Both sides are fed fresh water from fountains on each side. The swim up bar also has water falling into the pool from giant clams overhead. Many of the day time activities take place here. In the towel shack building, there is also a small, free library. To one side is the Kids Club building and the Gym/Spa, on the other is the beach restaurant that serves a good noon buffet and pulls double duty as the specialty Steak House restaurant in the evenings. Actually, it is split up as two restaurants each with their own buffet, but since everyone goes from one to the other it is all the same place to me. Gym/Spa: Air conditioned with modern exercise equipment. Normal spa services provided at additional cost. Two large Jacuzzi tubs on the porch, one warm, the other nice and hot. Small his and hers sauna that they will have brought up to temp if you will give them advance notice of your wish to use them. Hot tubs can be used by both sexes at the same time, but saunas are strickly his and hers. Beach: Before you get to the beach, you walk through a large area of palm trees with loungers and hammocks. The beach bar is located in the middle of this area and there is almost always a waiter wondering around with a large tray of assorted drinks asking guest if they would like one. How much lazier can you get than to have a fresh drink brought to you before you even ask for one? One day during our stay they had a beach party at noon in this area with a live band, dancing, and a limited buffet with food cooked on the spot from a charcoal grill. To one side of this area is the dive shack that provide the normal water activities. There is also a hut on the edge of the tree line if you want a beach massage (at an additional cost). There are no shortage of loungers between the tree line and the shore, but I am unsure if drink service is provided here since, as with every beach in Mexico, it is a public area accessible by anyone. Very good swimming area with good sand under foot throughout. There is only a slight dip from the breaking waves as you wade out into the water. This beach area is raked cleaned every night and is a true joy to experience. Food: Very good buffet with a different theme each evening. A few times they had a kid come out of the kitchen wearing an apron with his guitar so that he a several of the waiters could sing happy birthday to someone. It was only later that we found out how they celebrate the kitchen help's birthdays. Main buffet offered a wide selection at all meals. The specialty restaurants were OK for a more formal dining experience, but felt the food (except the beef) was just as good at the buffet. At the Steak House, half of my sirloin was very good, half was over cooked. Every other steak I've had in Mexico was over cooked. On the evening we ate at the Steak House, there was a very pleasant sole sax playing in the other half of the building. This may have been for a wedding, but it was very pleasant. The Brazilian was OK, but nothing special. The Fusion (Krystal) was superb and well worth making a reservation at. Enjoyed an excellent steak one night and their lamb there on another night. We did not try the Japanese restaurant. Of the 8 all inclusives we have been at in Mexico, this one by far had the best food. Rooms: All rooms to my knowledge are accessed from interior corridors which provide additional security. Doors are locked with a key instead of an electric card that is more common these days. A lanyard is attached to the key if you want to wear it around your neck. Most rooms do not get a wi-fi signal, though I believe that the ones close to the main building can. Unlike some of the other Riu Palace resorts, the halls have no carpet and are tiled throughout. This helps cut down on wet carpet that can smell musty but makes for more noise outside of the room. There was an ice machine just around the corner from our room. Rooms face both ways - towards the central courtyard, or out towards neighboring resorts (the Viva Wynham Maya on the north wing, and the Riu Yucatan on the south wing). A few rooms face towards the pool and the palm trees at the end of each wing. Due to the large stand of palm trees between the pool and the beach, only a few of the rooms on the top floor will give you even a partial view of the ocean. All rooms have a balcony or patio. Some of the balcony's half walls are solid meaning you have to stand up to see down on the fountains or the ground. We liked the layout of the rooms for most part - on the ground floor facing the fountains. A separate door and hallway divided the bedroom and sitting area from the bathroom. Yes the shower is a bit dim with the curtain pulled across the opening but not to the point that it bothered us. Must say that we found it unusual to hear other people (via vents) talking and using their plumbing while in our bathroom. Even the bathroom had nice tile and wood work with corner molding on the ceilings. The step down sitting area has a dresser with a lamp and LCD TV on one side, a small, uncomfortable couch and table on the other side. We would have preferred a chair or two and some kind of light on the sitting side of the room. Our patio had two plastic chairs and a small table. There were plenty of hangers in the closet next to the bed. An electronic safe is located on the floor of the closet. Next to the closet was the bar, with it's 4 750ml bottles of spirits and the fridge with DosXX, water, cans of soft drinks, tonic and soda water. A counter area here contains the coffee maker, fixins and glasses. Supplies were restocked daily. Bed: Our bed consisted of two full size beds, each with their own bedding pushed together. We usually prefer a king-sized bed, but found we like this set up too. What we didn't like is how the mattresses were worn from people sitting on the edge. I slept fine on mine, but my wife's left her sore in the mornings when she got up. The pillows we had were totally worn out - flat and with no bounce left in them. We used 3 pillows each and it was like sleeping on folded up clothing. We could clearly hear people walking around in the room and corridor above our room. I am of the opinion that this room was an exception to the rule. However, it is what we experienced and as such is the sole reason for giving this resort 4 stars instead of 5. Other services: I enjoyed taking the hobby craft out a few times. 2 good tennis courts on the north side of the main building. There are 4 other Riu resorts that you can visit within a short distance of this one. A small shopping center is located a few minutes down the street. Bicycles can be rented at one of the other resorts. 24 hour sports bars with a number of T.V.s are located at the Tequila and at the other Palace. In short, this is a beautiful, elegant resort in paradise with some of the best food and entertainment that we have ever experienced. A number of guest we talked to from Europe, Canada, and the US return here time after time. It was the 10th trip to this resort for 2 couples we talked to that were from Holland - and they were staying for 4 weeks this time. However, the room noise we experienced, and the poor sleeping bed and pillows provided is unacceptable in this class of resort. Based on our experience I can not recommend room #0131 at this time, but I sure would recommend the resort for everything else. Keep in mind that in 2012 this Riu will be closed for several months as it under goes a major refurbishment.", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "LiverpoolBP", "Title": "\u201cLovely Hotel, Wonderful Holiday!\u201d", "Author": "Liverpoolaa", "ReviewID": "UR121822714", "Content": "Stayed with my Husband from (28th Nov-12 Dec) The majority of staff were a credit to the Riu chain of hotels, Before we went my Husband emailed Reception & requested a top floor room, he also mentioned in the email that I would be celebrating my Birthday on the 5th of December. On arrival we were greeted with a cold drink and allocated room 2018 on the top floor, this was set back from the court yard. The room was lovely very spacious and the bed was massive. The view from the balcony wasn't up to much it overlooked another hotel with a walkway to the beach between the two hotels.

Especially noteworthy are the expansive beach, many lounges, great buffets, and beautiful grounds. We still consider Secrets Maroma the best in the area, so let's compare the Palace with it. First, overall appearance goes to the Riu. It has very attractive buildings and beautifully manicured grounds, whereas the first impression of Secrets is fort-like. Pools--goes to Secrets. We're not pool people but noticed at the RIU few people were actually in the pool. They lounged around but, perhaps, the water was too cool. We rarely saw anyone in a pool (except a few at the pool bar). The Riu pools could have been in any inland hotel--they were removed from the beach and far from the beachfront. Secrets' pools were more conducive and more occupied, even equipped with rafts. The pools looked out at the beach and sea in a beautiful setting. Plus, Secrets had a poolside snack area, grilling up burgers, steaks, and other goodies. Also, Secrets offers wandering food carts brewing up fajitas, tacos, and the like. Both resorts have restaurants near the pools--Riu has two buffets and Secrets a table service steak grill. Beaches--Two very different beaches. Secrets' beach is smaller, more intimate, and more closely integrated with the resort. The water was clearer, the sand was fine, and there were ample lounges and palapas. Bar service was frequent. The Riu beach is amazing in its expansiveness--you walk through the sand for about a block or so to the waterfront, where you are confronted with a vast array of lounges and several rows of palm trees--no palapas. The beach and palms are very impressive and beautiful, but the beach abuts that of the Riu next door, which adds another 500 roomsful of people competing for space and lounges. We always found a lounge near a tree (for some shade), but people coming down around 11 had trouble. We found, and may others commented on, how cloudy the water was, not at all like we've found over the past 15 years in the area--maybe it was the weather, which was sunny, but had a couple of days of wind and rough water. Rooms--both resorts kept the rooms spotlessly clean, but Secrets offers a much more luxurious setting--with four-poster bed, jacuzzi tub, and elaborate detail. Riu rooms are older and suffer from a few problems--poor lighting, especially in the bathroom; a tv set in fixed position that couldn't be rotated toward the bed; few amenities; and having two beds pushed together instead of a king-size. The refrigerator was well stocked and the Riu does have a wall bar of bottles of rum, tequila, brandy and vodka--nice idea! Overall the Riu room was quite nice, but lacked a WOW factor. Front desk--easily goes to Riu. We arrived early and the receptionist--Ildiko--at Riu was very helpful, showing us 4 rooms from which to choose and setting us up in one better than we expected. Front desk at Secrets was professional but not pleasant. Restaurants--you've already read reviews of the food. The specialty restaurants at Secrets offered higher quality food and you do not have to reserve in advance (a plus!). At Riu, one must arrange reservations each morning for that evening-for 6:30 or 8:30 only. Worth noting is the main buffet at Riu, which was almost always very good but especially on Monday night's Asian theme--where they had large woks filled with lobster tails, stone crab claws, roast duck, and lots of other goodies--not to be missed! We ate more meals in the Riu buffet than usual because it gave us better control of our time--and the food was so good. Overall, both resorts are very nice and we had a great time in both. Secrets is adults only and will cost you more and you can decide if it is worth it--you won;t go wrong at the Riu, either!", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "oak creek.

It was recommended to us by a travel agent and we are so glad we listened to him! This is not my first all inclusive, but it was certainly the best one. Besides the property being so immaculate at all times, even though it is on the older side, the staff was incredible. You never sat down at a table without someone coming and making sure you were all set for drinks, your water glass was never under half full and they even opened your soda bottle and poured it for you! All with giant smiles on their faces. The food was your general buffet mix, but they had theme nights to switch things up - always so much to choose from. I think the best part of the trip (besides the sunshine and beach, of course) was the entertainment staff. There are activities almost every hour during the day, and many to choose from. Then, at night, there is a live band and dancing with that same staff which is followed by a show in the theater (i.e. Mamma Mia, Grease, Michael Jackson and others!). The staff, mostly Cindy, Fredy and Carlos made each day a blast! By the end I was just as sad to leave the people as the beach. For entertainment after 11pm (which pretty much ended at the RPM) you could go across the street to Riu Tequila where they have a club and the bars are always full until late (definitely a younger crowd over there). The resort is in a gated community and we always felt safe walking around there. You can also go into Playa Del Carmen - we went to the CocoBongo one night and Mandala another - they are both great, but you cannot miss out on the CocoBongo! If you want to go, ask some of the entertainment staff about getting there - they know what to do and they will help you have the best experience possible!

The property has been maintained extremely well - though the suites need some freshening (a complete rejuvenation is apparently coming in Summer 2012) the whole experience is still fantastic. The beaches are well maintained - lots of sun and shade depending on your preference. The buffet offers something for everyone. The bars still offer several premium brands - and the wait staff are eager to please. We tried 2 of the restaurants - the steakhouse and the fusion (Cristal). They were pleasant and the staff was most accomodating. Two suggestions - the food in the fusion restaurant was heavily salted - both the fish and the filet. Please ask the chef to put down the salt shaker. A good piece of fish or beef does not require heavy salting. Also, it would be nice to see a slightly better calibre of wine offered. I don't expect vintage but the table wines are not very good and there are better inexpensive wines out there to be offered. We stuck to the cava which is definitely quaffable.

If you're trying to figure out if this is right for you vs. other all inclusive resorts along the Riviera Maya, or if you want details or have specific questions, read on ... RESTAURANTS: All of the food was very good. Plenty of variety for breakfast and lunch on the buffets, with hot foods cooked to order as well. For breakfast Don Julian provides a vast variety of food. La Traviata has a more limited selection, but it is the breakfast option from 10:30 to noon, and was appreciated on the day we wanted to sleep in a bit later. For dinner we tried all of the options. A friend arrived a day earlier than we did and made a reservation for all of us at Krystal, the fusion cuisine restaurant, for the first night. It was excellent, with a some very unique (ecclectic?) and tasty dishes. The portions are appropriately sized--after a starter, first course, second course, and dessert, you'll be plenty full. Next we tried Miyagi, the Japanese restaurant. It was fine, but compared to all of the other dining options, it ranked last on our list. The sushi was more of the California-ized variety, and some of the dishes or accents didn't seem authentic Japanese. La Bodega provides a real nice array of grilled meats served tableside, and also has some interesting things on the salad and desert bar that you won't find elsewhere. This is located in a single room back in a corner and lacks windows. El Patio is a nice open air change of setting, near, but not right on, the beach. The service was very good as was the food. Finally, the buffet at Don Julian. It was always good with a large array. On Carribean night they had large crab claws, grilled lobster ... Another night included Beef Wellington, among many other dishes. I never counted, but I would guess they had twenty or so entrees each evening, along with plenty of sides, a huge cold bar ... We never tried the room service. The menu seemed limited and we just didn't have the desire or need. Ranking the restaurants, first would come Krystal. We liked it so much we went back for my wife's birthday on our last day at the resort. After that, El Patio probably edges out La Bodega. The Don Julian buffet overall is at the same level, but probably comes out higher on its best nights, lower on others. Finally, Miyagi comes in last. If I were at the resort for a full week again, I might go to Miyagi again, or I might skip it. ROOMS: I picked the RPM over several other options because all the rooms are junior suites (or bigger), with a small sitting area with a loveseat. If I'm going to stay somewhere for an extended period of time, I appreciate having a comfortable place to sit instead of having to read, write, etc. in bed. The RPM delivered in this regard. From the many pictures, you can see the decor is a bit ? Dated? Gaudy? No, not quite gaudy, but not as refined or stylish as some resorts. On the other hand, this is in the hotel that looks something like a Mexican palace, and is named as such. You're vacationing in Mexico, so go with it. That was my attitude with respect to the decor. Before arriving, looking at the pictures of the lobby, etc. I thought the place might be quite ostentatious. After seeing it in person, I would say it is just ostentatious. The Riu Palace Riviera Maya might still qualify as quite ostentatious. Now the bad ... Our first room wreaked of cigarette smoke. Housekeeping provided an air purifier, but after dinner the room still smelled. The front desk provided us a different room, which smelled much better. The next morning, however, I awoke to a strange sound, which turned out to be water dripping from the ceiling onto the arm of the couch in the sitting area. I moved the couch and put a towel down on the floor. Later I put down more towels, and housekeeping changed them as well. Hurricane Rina had just passed by, and I really didn't want to change rooms again. That night I asked the front desk if they could mop up the floor and clean up the water, which they did, and the room remained dry for the remainder of the trip. Water dripping from the ceiling sounds pretty bad, and it was a bit disturbing at first; but given the hurricane/tropical storm/tropical depression that had just drenched the place, I'm willing to cut the resort some slack. I'd still go back to the RPM. Some people have said the beds are too hard. I thought the bed was fine. (Others that have stayed at multiple resorts point out that all beds in Mexico seem to be on the high end of firm.) Our room was made up with the two double beds joined together as one giant bed. I never noticed the gap in the middle, so whatever cover they put on top worked well. BEACH: I had seen some Mayan Riviera beach pictures in which there were large errosion control mounds in the water, and I think they show up in some of the Google satellite images. And I was concerned that Hurricane Rina might take the beach away, as previous hurricanes had done. But my worries went away when we walked out to the playa. No mounds, no real garbage (some cups and straws from resorts guests, cleaned up at the end of the day), lots of nice sand and surf. It was a wonderful place to relax, and in the first week of November, there were plenty of empty chairs in the sun, in the partial shade, and in the total shade of the palm trees. In fact, this is one thing I particularly like about the RPM. At some of the other resorts, the hotel abuts right up to the beach. At the RPM, the hotel is set back a little bit. You might not think about this, but from a boat on the water, it is quite obvious. The result is that there is a nice buffer between the beach and the hotel, and more lounging options. All the resorts have chairs on the beach. The RPM also has rows of chairs in the palm trees, which get more dense closer to the resort. There is also an area with hammocks strung up between the trees. I enjoyed reading a book and falling asleep in one of the hammocks one afternoon. Given the hotel setback from the beach, you do have to walk and extra minute and half to get to the water compared to many of the other resorts, but I think this is a positive tradeoff. Also, one day they were grilling food close to the beach, and every day there were plenty of waiters delivering tropical beverages down to the water's edge. The beach is excellent. If I had to nitpick, the waiters could have a few more glasses of water instead of their other beverages, and the chairs could be a little easier to get into the flat position, but I'm really struggling here to find something negative about the beach. SCUBA: Scuba Caribe is an adequate dive operation, and was ideal for our needs. My wife and I did our classroom and pool dives stateside, so all we needed to complete our open water certification was four open water dives. We arranged to do this with Scuba Caribe, and were open water certified in two days. There are plenty of scuba operations in town, and some will save you $5 or $10 per dive, but by the time you take a cab and account for the convenience factor, you might as well stay at the resort dive operation. It was very easy to get up, have breakfast, go back to our room, put on our wetsuits, and walk down to the shop and gear up for the boat. Between the morning and afternoon, we easily enjoyed lunch and spent some time on the beach. That said, diving around PDC is nothing like diving Cozumel, and just getting on and off the boat at the beach is a bit of an adventure. There is no pier to walk down and hop on the boat. Instead, you gear up with everything except your tank and fins by the beach. The boat pulls up and a line is run from the boat to the shore. You then hand your fins to one of the dive shop helpers and walk and then swim/pull the line to the boat. Climb onto the boat, take off your BCD, then hook it up to the tank ... Getting back into the boat after a dive is done with your tank on. There are a few people around to help if you struggle with this, but you are more or less on your own. The return back to the resort after the dive is a bit like the departure. With gear on except tank, and fins in hand, jump off the boat and swim back to the beach. This is not a \"full service\" dive operator. One of our friends who is accustomed to a higher dive service level likened getting on to the boat to the evacuation of Dunkirk, and getting off to the storming of the beach at Normandy. Okay, it wasn't that bad, but you get the idea. For our four dives, we went to Jadines twice, Moxche, and Barracuda. Of those three, Barracuda was the best and most interesting. Perhaps some of the early morning deeper dives are better. If you want to dive Cozumel or the cenotes, you can arrange this with Scuba Caribe, but you won't be diving with the same people that operate the dives out of the resort. Given this, we arranged our later dives on our own. We dove off of Cozumel with www.divewithchristina.com. Cozumel has incredible diving, and divewithchristina.com is a more full service oriented dive operator. For one example of this, when you finish the dive, you take off your BCD and tank in the water, and they haul it up to the boat for you. We dove the Dos Ojos cenote with tankha.com. Tank-Ha is a bit more like Scuba Caribe in terms of level of service, but seemed to operate in the same manner as the other operators at Dos Ojos. SPECIAL OCCASIONS: We went to the RPM to celebrate my wife's birthday. I saw pictures on Trip Advisor of decorated rooms and told the front desk about my wife's birthday so they could decorate our room. They did decorate the room with flowers one day, but in fact it was two days before her birthday. A minor slip there I think, or maybe I wasn't totally clear? Also, they tried to deliver a plate of fruits and a birthday wish to the wrong room, where our friends were staying. We also made a reservation at the Krystal restaurant for her birthday. They did an outstanding job for the occasion. The table was decorated, a surprisingly delicious cake decorated, and mariachis sang. That made for a very nice celebratory evening.

We have stayed in many hotels all over the world and I can be quite discerning. But I just don't understand the negative reviews that this hotel sometimes receives. If it is not to your liking then I suggest you pay even more for your holiday or do not go \"all inclusive\"!! The staff work very hard and there was continuous cleaning everywhere. The hotel and grounds were immaculate! Our room was nice and we had a view of the fountains. We would like to make a particular mention to Eliel in the Buffet restaurant who was always friendly, hard-working and made sure our glasses were filled. The staff in the Lobby and entertainment areas were particulary efficient too. The general service was excellent! We liked the sophisticated edge to the hotel. I agree with another review that the RPRM is a little more rowdy! The good thing about this hotel is that you can visit all the other Rius in the area. The food in general is pretty good. We always found something to eat and as my partner is quite a fussy eater the negative reviews are not to be believed. We had a lovely meal in the steakhouse and the flambe Baked Alaska was to die for!! Yes, we didn't find all the staff to be overly friendly but then not everybody is friendly by nature. But nobody was ever rude! If I have to be picky then the three things I would gripe about is that some of the waiters in the buffet restaurant are not very quick to get drinks for you. Another criticism was the miming at the entertainment shows. Surely some of the cast can sing? It would be more natural and entertaining if some of the songs were sung by the Riu staff themselves. The dancing is very good and we particularly enjoyed the Mexican show. The third thing is having to book the speciality restaurants early morning on the actual day that you want to go. If you are on a trip then you can't book! My daughter is at a Riu hotel in the Dominican Republic at the moment and they get three days to book these restaurants!

We had chosen the RPM after having visited the resort 6 months prior while staying just down the beach at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya. We decided to stay at the RPM this time because it was closer to the other Riu\u2019s, I liked the feel of the resort and the pool and beach area seemed just a bit better than the RPRM. Two weeks prior to arrival I emailed the resort requesting some room locations (close to the beach, upper floor, and to be close to our friends). Upon arrival we were informed of a nice upgrade to room 1053, and our friends were right beside us in 1054! Nice! We had also requested an ala carte reservation for that night and we were scheduled for the early sitting at the Brazillian Rodizio that evening. So here is our impression of the resort: Rooms The rooms were nice and fresh and conveniently located in the middle of the building closest to the beach. No water view, but the fountain/courtyard view was very nice. Room 1053 is actually on the second, or middle floor, and is located pretty much in the middle of that building. If we were to stay here again we\u2019d again request this room. The room was cleaned nicely each day early afternoon, and the mini bar was restocked daily. Rooms are spacious enough with the little sitting area with LCD tv,a large balcony for early morning breakfasts, and a large enough bathroom. The shower is fantastic! If you like high water pressure in your shower, youll enjoy these. Get in, grab a hold, and turn it on. Also liked that they had installed those anti door slamming devices. Grounds/Facilities The grounds are nicely maintained and the fountains in the courtyard are very nice. The lobby area and inside lounges are also very nice. I heard that the piano lounge is open till 7 am but I could never fully test that out. Lots of top shelf drinks available but sadly they recently stopped stocking Havana Club :( We checked out the RIu Yucatan and the Riu Tequila and they were both nice. While visiting the Yucatan we found a group of about 10 howler monkeys in the trees (cool!) and while hanging out at the large pool at the Tequila we enjoyed all the Coati\u2019s. We could easily access the free wifi in the lobby lounge, and could occasionally get it in the courtyard as well\u2026reception was better the closer you were to the lobby. Evenings in the Courtyard The courtyard in the evenings is centre of activity on the resort in the evenings. It is perfectly sized so that everyone can be seated and enjoy the evening. Bands, theme nights, market nights, and generally just an enjoyable atmosphere can be found in the courtyard. Staff in the courtyard are without a doubt top-notch and deliver the best service. Activity pretty much ends at midnight, so a couple times we would head over to the club or the sports bar at the Riu Tequila, just across the street. Nice and convenient. Beach/Pool Being in Playacar, which had its beach restored last year, the beach is wonderful. We enjoyed that there are no palapas but rather palm trees to provide shade. There is plenty of space and loungers and finding a lounger at 10 am was no problem\u2026.but it did get busy by 11:30 or so. But loungers could still be had quite easily. Drink service was quite frequent\u2026they come around with a large tray of various mixed blender type drinks and you pick and choose. I actually liked that approach as I tried many different drinks that I probably would not have otherwise tried before. We made the \u201csunrise\u201d a staple on our walk down to the beach\u2026try it youll like it. Beach bar opened at 10! Food This was the only thing that was disappointing. I think that I was just unlucky with my entrees at the ala cartes as everyone else in our group enjoyed their meals. It was nice to have bottle service at the ala cartes\u2026go for the Chilean cab sauv its quite good. Steakhouse: The \u201cfilet\u201d was actually a fast fry steak folded to make it appear thick like a filet. Overly salted as well. Not good at all. Krystal: The filet was weird\u2026it was an actual filet but was like eating gristle\u2026but when I looked at the steak each time it did not look like gristle. Weird. The ravioli appetizers were to die for though. Japanese: The tempura was very bad and it was a stretch to call it such, and any actual sushi involved under cooked almost crunchy rice. Least favourite as nothing appealed to me, except for the deep fried ice cream which was quite good. Brazilian: The only ala carte that I enjoyed. The cream of asparagus soup was most tasty! We had some very good meats served\u2026but then when meat is served on a stick its always good! ;) Don Julio Buffet: There was always a wide selection of tasty food at the buffet and we all enjoyed the buffet\u2026particularly enjoyed the beef wellington one night. In hindsight we should have done the buffets every night. For breakfast the offerings are vast and we particularly enjoyed the huge selection of smoothies available. Beach Buffet for Lunch: It filled the void but nothing spectacular. The two days they had the beach bbq we enjoyed burgers and grilled chicken. Too bad they didn\u2019t have it every day as it was a nice convenient and tasty lunch. Also, there was a band playing during lunch on those bbq days and we really enjoyed the music. They should have that every day and have it on for longer too! Overall We all really enjoyed the RPM. The service was the best Ive experienced, the rooms were quite nice and well appointed and cleaned spotlessly, the beach area was fantastic, the pool was pretty good, all the staff were fantastic with an extra nod to the staff in the courtyard (Hiram and his crew!), and the proximity to town and the other Riu\u2019s was great.

The Area: First time to the Mayan, but have stayed at Cancun before....very close to the same. Lots to do, lots of excursions. Maybe the only slight downfall is it is more commercialized then say Cuba or Dominican. It just depends what you want.

Not sure if I like it better then Xplor but they are 2 different kinds of parks. Xel-ha there is more to see and is more of an relaxing sight seeing park with different activities.

That made me feel much better about my decision to wed here. first - arrival was good - very fast. the front desk staff were outstanding. automatic room upgrade was nice. rooms were nice, big and the service was great. room service menu was limited (only sandwiches, not too fabulous) but boy was it ever prompt. bar fridge was ALWAYS filled and if empty, one call had someone up within minutes! unreal. also - always had phone calls checking to make sure that we were happy and everything was ok. always a plus:) grounds - ok the grounds here are absolutely stunning, the main reason I picked this hotel. will upload pics when I have some. but my wedding shots, ok all shots, were fabulous. pool - well the pool is a little odd. very unlike the Riu chain. But the front desk told me this hotel is closing late Aug 2012 for 3 months for an update/reno. I have a strong feeling the pool will be redone. otherwise it was still lovely, nice swim up bar, just no steps leading in, only a ladder. there is a shallower and deeper area though, and there is also a quiet side (no swim up bar). beach - ok this was OUTSTANDING. need I say more? food - I (like many others in my group) found the food to be quite delicious. The buffet had something to please everyone (both main and beach lunch buffets). Tried a few a la cartes, the Krystal was nice, beach El Patio (had wedding dinner here) was beyond delicious, and the Japanese was ok. Didn't hit the Brazilian, but heard it wasn't all that great. alcohol - 24 hour bar was fabulous. again a little different than the other Riu's. the lobby bar is 24 hours (usually pretty dead) and there is no sports bar at this complex. because it's a pay for 1 pay at all deal though, if necessary you could always hit up another Riu or just call room service. note - they won't deliver to the lobby bar. yes... I tried. lol. wedding - a few days before my wedding I walked over to the other Riu Palace (10 mins away) for my wedding meeting. this was a breeze. back at the hotel you get a bill, which you easily pay at the front desk in your lobby. day of the wedding, flowers arrived in my room 1 hr before the ceremony for everyone, the gazebo was set up (GORGEOUS) and the wedding was flawless. the ceremony was in english (bonus!) and it was just wonderful. Then dinner at El Patio, which was also decorated and can I say the cake was DELICIOUS! and I'm not a big cake eater. vanilla with strawberry filling, sooooo fresh. amazing really! also my flowers were beyond gorgeous. it was all exactly what I wanted. and there was sooooo much champagne! (if anyone has any questions, please feel free to email me) So I will definitely return and recommend this hotel to any bride, or anyone for that matter. A wonderful vacation, an amazing wedding spent in paradise with the most attentive and friendly staff.", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Haverstraw, New York", "Title": "\u201cThe most FANTASTIC Vacation\u201d", "Author": "Stephanie S", "ReviewID": "UR121156971", "Content": "My boyfriend and I spent 5 days there, and we enjoyed every second.

When we arrived at the resort we were welcomed with a delicious drink while we were checking in...which went smoothly. We received our room key and towel cards and were told exactly where our rooms were. (We were a group of four). We had rooms 1097 and 1103 which were on the same level as the lobby just past where the outdoor courtyard is (they were both facing the back of the resort towards Cancun, but the nice thing was it was quiet with no one being able to see into your room). Location was perfect for us. I will say too that there is a musty smell in the lobby as others have said, so I was expecting it, but honestly that smell was limited to the lobby area and you did tend to get used to it. Definately didn't ruin the vacation by any means. We were welcomed with a cute towel animal and flowers on our bed...usually every day we got something new. It was always cool to see what they would leave for us each day. The room was immaculate and a great size. We are used to a king size bed at home but my husband joked that he had to text me to see if I was up in the morning. This bed is huge, and although being pretty firm...we both slept well. No complaints there at all. The grounds are kept immaculate as well. I would get up every morning around 6:30 to take pictures and there were alot of staff out and about cleaning and literally scrubbing the walkways, railings etc. The beach is absolutely stunning! It is huge and the vast amount of palm trees was really nice. We took advantage of the hammocks one day and had a siesta on the beach...who wouldn't enjoy that? The service is bar none, the best service we have ever received at any all inclusive we have ever gone to. They wouldn't even let our coasters get wet without coming around and changing them for us. They would come and ask if we wanted another drink if we were only 1/3 done...so you're glass is literally never empty. And I am a sucker for a nice tropical drink in the proper glass and they did not dissappoint in the lobby bar. Always with a piece of fruit in it too. Just a personal preference but I enjoyed it. Everyone there from the cleaning staff, to the groundskeepers, to the waiters and waitresses to the people at the front desk and the front door were always smiling and extremely friendly. And I have read some comments from people that the staff are always looking for tips. I found the opposite to be true. We tend to tip for every round of drinks because, lets face it they all work so hard there so that WE can have a great time. We found that sometimes we would try to give some waiters a tip and they would almost run off like they didn't want the tip. We certainly never felt like it was expected but with the amazing service that we received how could you not tip? Everyone was always saying Hola and have a nice day. I was amazed at how many staff members speak extremely good english at this resort...but I also enjoyed trying to speak spanish. Also wanted to mention that we didn't find the pool was cold as some have stated. We were actually quite happy with the temperature. On the beach it was a nice touch when the waiters would come by with a tray of assorted drinks and ask if you would like to try one. Once again service was amazing. We didn't even pull out our insulated drink cups the whole time we were there because our drinks were replenished so quickly. I honestly cannot say a bad word about this resort. The food was fantastic...and as I have said in previous reviews...I am a very picky eater. And for those who say they couldn't find something to eat here or if they got bored of the food, I can't imagine the feasts you must enjoy at home! There was literally something for everyone. We went to the Brazillian (La Bodega) Ala Carte and it was fantastic. The service again was incredible and we had a lot of fun with the waiters that night. We also went to the Steak Ala Carte and it was equally delicious and they certainly like to keep the champagne flowing. The bonus for me was to be able to check out all the other RIU resorts. I got up every morning and walked by myself to these resorts. Being in a gated community like Playacar, I felt extremely safe doing this. There was always people on the beach or on the cobblestone roads outside the resorts. For those considering the other RIU Palace (Riviera Maya): We did walk there on our way into Playa Del Carmen and enjoyed their breakfast buffet one morning (their bacon was better than ours haha) but other than that it was pretty much the same as the RPM. We also walked there via the beach one day (15 minute walk) and spent the afternoon in the Infinity pool, which we did enjoy. Their pool is also nicer than the one at our resort. The nice thing was, we could visit these resorts and then go back to our resort which was definately quieter, especially at night. I thought we had the best of both worlds. For those considering the RIU Palace Mexico...do not listen to the negative reviews as stated by other people. If you can find anything seriously wrong with this resort than you are looking too hard.

Room: The rooms wase nice and clean, but dated. This resort is starting to show its age and they need to touch it up a bit. Shower was nice and large though. No water issues or plumping either. Food and bars: Food was average at best and we actually had better food at the Tuquila and the Playacar. The food certainly did not feel like any upgrade to the 2 prior mentioned. Service was spotted at best too. Some days were great, and some days it totally sucked. Pool bar was barely acceptable for service and the pool cafe service was horrible. The main buffet at night was good for breakfast and dinner. Abraham was wonderful! He was what everyone should be like. Pool and beach: Beach was large and shaded, but we are not beach people. Now the pool...... small cramped and not much activities going on. The design is a total flop. Bar service sucked and lack of communication with two diff. bartenders. Not much personality either, unlike the Maya Riviera Palace. Also, tons of kids and families. Saw many reviews that said mainly couples. B.S., kids galore! Ruined our privacy and they felt like they were on top of us all the time. Actually the other palace kicks this palace's butt. We spent more time at the other palace than the mexico palace. Don't quite get these reviews here, but no way in heck this place touches the Maya Riviera Palace. All in all I would not waste my money on this palace that looks the part, but does not feel the part.

However, the buffets can get repetitive, so definitely take advantage of the specialty restaurants. The rooms are a good size, and feel very comfortable and clean. The shower had great water pressure and plenty of hot water. I only saw a few of the shows, but the ones I saw I enjoyed a lot. A couple areas of improvement are the front desk and room service. Sometimes the front desk was extremely efficient and helpful, and at other times they were not at all helpful and I ended up being frustrated. It very much seemed to depend on who was working at the front desk. Room service was a huge disappointment.

We were aparty of six, three couples aged 45 to 55. Having been to Mexico before, plus Cuba and Dominican Republic in similar 5 star all inclusive resorts, we are well qualified to comment on the Riu Palace. The Hotel is well presented inside and out. The maintenance staff are continually cleaning, repainting and maintaining the decor inside and out. Other reviewers have referred to a \"mildew\" smell which was present in the rooms but was not unpleasant, just something that you got used to. We only had one technical complaint when the air con temporarily went on the blink, which was quickly put right. To be fair the evening temperatures at the time of our visit meant the air con was not really required, the ceiling fan was adequate. We were surprised to find spirit optics in the room as well as the usual minibar. There were five spirits; Brandy, Vodka, Tequila and Bacardi. I presume they would swap these out if you're tipple was not included. The minibar contained bottled beer, cans of mixers, bottled water in large and small sizes. The rooms have a 22inch Sony Bravia flat screen TV. This was strangely glued in position for viewing from the seating area rather than from bed!! The pool will not suit length swimming types as it is small and shallow (1.4m max) The staff that serve the pool area are attentive and efficient, the plastic glasses though do not give the beer a good taste, but understandable foe H&S reasons. The bingo at 4pm was painful, if you win you are subjected to public humiliation by way of having to do a \"sexy dance\" Fine if you are hammered, not good if you aren't! The beach has a shady palm tree area and a full sun bit for the tanning freaks. At the time of our visit getting a bed was no problem if you were up and about before 10am. Reservation by towel at silly o'clock was not the norm as in some hotels. The a la carte restaurants were all good, bookings can only be made on the day you want to eat. Only one of the restaurants allows shorts - Le Patio Steakhouse. This policy includes the buffet restaurant which is unusual in my experience and caused me problems not packing enough long pants. To be fair you are made aware of this at every opportunity and it is rigidly enforced. This rule is the cause of much heartache on my holidays, women can walk in with cut off jeans, sports shorts etc teenagers can walk in with baseball caps on - but I can't get in with dress shorts on!!! crazy. The Cubano bar in the lobby is lavishly decorated but is a bit austere and lacks atmosphere, guest pianists, flautists and violinists ply their trade if that is what you enjoy. During the frequent downpours on our visit, there was not enough undercover areas to sit and drink. This leads to people in wet swimwear using seating used by guests in evening wear and could be one of the reasons for the \"mildew\" effect. Playa Del Carmen is a 140 MXP taxi ride away if you get stir crazy. You can walk it in about 20 mins. A Corona in Playa Del Carmen is about 40 MXP. Don't believe the Travel Agent hype about US Dollars not being accepted anymore, the dollar is still king and most shops and bars still post USD prices. The best thing about the hotel is it's staff. They are polite, efficient and seem genuinely aware that they rely on our trade for their livelyhood. Your drinks are topped up sharpish without any need to go looking. The food was amazing and at least as good as the Bahia Principe chain. Entertainment was not my scene but seemed to please the majority. Once you have seen one Michael Jackson impersonator and a Grease musical - you've seen them all! The gold \"Palace\" bracelet gets you into all the other Riu hotels for drinks, but their Red bracelets doesn't get them into yours - a bit of one upmanship if you have an ego.", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rotherham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFabulous Time!

We arrived on the wednesday and check in was quick and to the point, a welcome drink was given which was delicious! Staff on check in desk very courteous and answered all our questions. The room we had was large and spacious - 2 queen size beds pushed together, a sitting area, bathroom and a large balcony. All very clean too, and the mini bar was a welcome addition. Our balcony overlooked the main courtyard area which was nice, and it was lovely to sit up there at night and listen to the band after the entertainment. The beach at the hotel is amazing! It was very clean, and plenty of shade provided by the trees. A waiter also came round with trays of various drinks so you didn't even need to get up off your sunbed, which was really nice! The sea is quite clear once you swam out a bit. The pool was not as big as I expected - this was a bit of a down point for us, and we quite like swimming around - it's set up in a odd way, it's kidney shaped, but cuts off in the middle and there is no slope to get it, just steps. One side where the pool bar is located it quite shallow and the other half is deeper for swimming. Again, plenty of sunbeds and waiter service. Food - the food was amazing! We did eat in all the restuarants apart from the Japanese. The fusion was 'unusual'. Starters were not very nice, but the main course and desert were quite good. The steakhouse and brazillian were very nice. Buffet was good, plenty to choose from, but did become a bit repetetive after 10 days. There could have bit a little more choice, but what was provided was plentiful and of a good quality. Same goes for the drinks - if you wanted branded spirits you have to ask for them or they give you the cheap stuff. The entertainment at night was quite good - some of the shows were a little bit naff but some were fab! The Mayan show at night was really good. One night there was a marichaci band and dancing which was really good. Every night before it started there was a band or a singer on, which we enjoyed. Casino night was quite a laugh and and the same for the games they did on mexican night. Staff were pleasant and courteous, and went out of their way to help you. To walk into 5th avenue from the Hotel takes about 20 minutes, and is a pleasant walk. We booked all our trips there, and they were half the price of what the tour operator was charging so we were pleasantly suprised! There is a little shopping centre over the road, but it is a little more expensive than 5th avenue - don't bother going in the silver shop, I saw a necklace I like, but they wanted \u00a3400 for it, whcih I thought was a little expensive.

Our first impression was that the hotel is beautiful. It looks just like the pictures. We got there at around 1 and check in wasn't till 3. They had us leave our luggage in the lobby, where everyone had acess. That worried me a litile because anyone could have claimed our bag was theirs, but in the end nothing was missing when we came back. Check in at 3 was quick and easy, but when we got to our room the maid was still cleaning it...she didn' speak english so it was uncomfortable trying to explain to her to just let us drop off our bags and she could finish...not sure if it was done before she left....oh well. The room was nice. It was big, with the 2 beds pushed together. There is a mildew smell, but you get used to it pretty quickly. Fully stocked bar was refilled every time they cleaned the room. We did have a urine smell on one side of our bed that never went away...it was gross. I think someone actaully urinated on the edge of the bed...which would be a smell that was hard to get out...we were again too uncomfortable to complain. This would be unique to just our room though, as it was definately only one particular area in the room that smelled that way. Hint, if you run the air conditioner while you are gone it will help with the smell and the humidity. It was way more comfortable in the room when we figured that out. The urine smell made one of the two beds pretty much un useable, so between that and the noise, sleep was not easy. (2 adults on one full size bed) I am sure we could have requested a room change, but we don't like to complain. I suggest if this is something that could ruin your vacation, make sure you request a change. Our room was 103...on the basement floor. We had a lot of foot traffice going by our room in the middle of the night...they were drunk and loud. But that isn't the hotel's fault. We were near a popular stair case, so maybe try getting a room that is farther away from all the atcivies and major walk ways. The beach was amazing! Very beautiful! It was not easy getting a drink while you were on it...too many people to serve i guess. but there is a bar on the way where you can get one to bring with you. There were people who had insulated mugs/cups that they would just have filled. That was a good idea. Pool was nice too. No complaints, and swim up bar was pretty cool. Buffet food was lacking. Lots of fried food. We preferred the breakfast. You could always find something you could eat...but i just expected a 4 star hotel to have more quality food. The soft serve ice cream (or frozen yogurt?) machine at the lunch buffets near the beach were the best dessert they had...everything else tasted funny. Though the oreo cheescake did actually taste like good cheesecake. We had a few meals at mexican restaurants outside the hotel and wished they had that same quality at the hotel. The dinner restaurants were awesome! It is worth the reservations process. If you want a early time at a particualr restaurant, you want to get to the counter before 9. If you are not picky, you can go later and get something. We favored the brazillian fusion...lots of good meat. The french was new for us, but very good (krystal). The steak at the seak house was good quality, though I ordered medium and got well done while my husband ordered the same and his was cooked correctly. It seemed to me that the steak house was more focused on sea food, so if you like sea food, you will ike this. We only did one night of the actual hotel entertainment. Casino and then Mr Riu contest were very fun! Casino is free and you use your winings for an auction of prizes later. Mr. riu was hilarious! Over all a very nice hotel. Staff was very nice and helpful. They make them wear full on suits while they are running around trying to get everyone drinks...they work really hard and deserve tips. They were fun and really wanted to help you...did not feel at all like they were annoyed with any of our requests. We are not too into getting drunk, but you definately can here, just order strong drinks and hang out. They will make it however you like. So, rooms could be better do to smells and the double bed thing. Buffet food is not amazing, but lots of choices, you will not starve.

We had one of the best weeks of our lives! Let's start with the basics: we are a young couple, 26 and 28, who are very laid back but kind of finicky about food. I am in the service industry, and we both know what we're looking for when it comes to quality of service. We're also well-travelled for being a young couple, and I'm a stickler for a place with good reviews. That being said, I did my research for a good week or two before deciding on this resort. In general, the reviews stated that it was a gorgeous, well-kept resort with decent food, great service, and a gorgeous beach. Here's our personal take... We booked with Apple Vacations which was very easy and offered a great deal. It was also nice to be able to put down a deposit to hold the reservation and pay the rest within about a month. Apple offers round trip transfers from the airport and I will say to anyone staying in the Playacar complex (the complex of resorts the RPM is located in) DO NOT pay for the \"Riu Shuttle\" they offer. They group their shuttles based on location when you're waiting outside the airport, so you're most likely ending up on a shuttle that is going solely to the Playacar complex anyway. Our shuttle had us, a group of 2 couples staying at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya (which we visited and I'll comment on later) who stated they paid extra for a direct transfer (so they were dropped off first), and 2 women who were going to the Sandos Playacar. The shuttle only took about 40 minutes or so, we dropped the group of 4 at the RPRM and were at the RPM about 3 minutes later. Upon arrival we were greeted at the door by Manuel, with whom we became fast friends. He is wonderful, helpful, extremely friendly and kind. He always got us a taxi when needed and high-fived us every time we saw him. Check-in was a breeze, very fast, welcome drinks were given to us, and they explained the whole deal with the resort: towel cards for your beach/pool towels, key to the room, gold Palace wristband (which is surprisingly not uncomfortable, I hardly noticed it was there!). The bellhops were summoned to get our luggage, and the 2 men just glanced up and then continued their conversation. We didn't mind, as we only had 2 rolling suitcases, so we found our way to our room (although I'm sure some people would have been rightfully peeved at this). We were in room 1129, a basic junior suite on the same floor as the lobby, which is the 2nd floor. I had emailed prior to arrival asking for a 2nd or 3rd floor room, so obviously they were able to accommodate. The rooms are spacious and very clean. Some state that they seem dated, but we just found them as having festive Mexican ambience. Our balcony overlooked the pool area as our room was the second to last in the building. We quite liked the location, as it was a nice view as well as convenient coming back from the beach or pool. The mini bar was stocked with soda, Dos XX, and water, and was always restocked every day or so. We were big on bringing those bottles of Pepsi with us in the afternoon! There are also liquor dispensers above the mini fridge, Smirnoff vodka, Bacardi silver rum, brandy, and Jose Cuervo of course. Surprisingly, we never used them, although that's probably because we spent very little time in our room. The bathrooms have a bidet and a toilet, a tub/shower that doesn't have a light (we showered with the curtain open to remedy this), a hair dryer, the usuals. The bed is 2 full beds pulled together and they are quite firm, however neither was a problem for us. They can provide you with a mattress pad if you'd prefer. After seeing our room and walking around the resort, we were amazed at how gorgeous it is. The resort is having renovations done next year, August through November I believe, and we were both saying how if the resort looks this nice now it must look absolutely amazing once they're done! It is by far the cleanest resort I've seen, they are constantly working on upkeep and tidiness. The beach is absolutely stunning. The water is bright blue and clear when you're in it, although it was quite \"rough\", for lack of a better term, for the first 2 or 3 days of our trip, so the waves kicked up a lot of sand and seaweed that remained throughout the week. The water temperature is perfect, not too warm or cold. We made sure to go in every day. The sand is beautiful, white and always clean. We usually didn't have a problem finding beach chairs, however during the end of our stay the hotel must have been at capacity because we were finding it harder and harder to get chairs later in the afternoon. While swimming we left our cellphones and camera at our chairs and never had any problems with anything disappearing. Included is the use of snorkel equipment, boogie boards, catamarans, etc. We used the snorkel masks several times, but didn't see much since the water was quite active like I mentioned before. The water activity workers will come around to try to sell you on excursions, a polite no will usually do the trick. The pool is nice but chilly! We only went in twice, once for the pool bar and once just to swim. If you jump in after getting hot while laying in the sun it's nice and refreshing but still a little chilly. The service overall was fantastic. Tips are not required but appreciated. We actually saw very little tipping while there. The bartenders will get to know you and will remember what you're drinking. We had great service at the beach bar, pool bar, lobby bar, you name it. Hiran was our favorite! He is amazing, one of the hardest workers I've ever seen. Quite frequently we saw him in his suit walking along the beach with the drink waiter, a bottle of liquor in hand adding more to people's drinks! He is truly amazing! Beach service is spotty, especially on certain days, but we didn't mind having to get up to get a drink. The drinks themselves were good. Small cups and sometimes weak, but you can always ask for it to be stronger! And if you bring a larger cup they'll gladly fill it for you. If you like bananas (which I LOVE) try the Dirty Monkey! It was my favorite. I also liked the pi\u00f1a coladas and the Bananamama. The food, overall, was alright. We only did one ala carte, Rodizio, the Brazilian restaurant, and we would not reccommend it. Most of the meats were not very good, and having been to some amazing Brazilian steakhouses it's quite a letdown. We did not have a problem getting a reservation though, and the line was never long. The buffets were good, individual foods are hit or miss of course. Our favorite was Don Julian, the main buffet. Very large, lots of choices. Breakfast was great. Smoothie station, make your own mimosas, omelettes, eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, waffles, French toast, potatoes, muffins, bread, the works! My favorite meal of the day by far. The dinner at this buffet had theme nights (Mexican, Asian, Italian, etc.) but still always had something for everyone. Great salad bar, great fresh fruit (if you spot some Proscuitto out try some with the melon!), great bread, crepe station for dessert, it was very nice. The service at Don Julian is great as well. They're quick to refill your drinks and clear your plates as you finish. For lunch we tried the buffets at La Traviata and El Patio (which becomes the steakhouse ala carte a dinner) and they were alright. Nothing special but still adequate. The entertainment staff is a lot of fun. My boyfriend played beach volleyball every day, twice on most days, we played bingo at the pool bar and both won (I won a visor, bandana, and a huge shot of tequila haha, he won a bottle of tequila and a huge shot of Southern Comfort), and we also went to Casino Night, which was quite fun. All play money of course, but they give you chips and you can play either black jack or roulette. Since we're young the entertainment staff really took a liking to us and tried to get us to come out to town with them on numerous occasions but we were just too beat from the sun and activities of the day. If you get the chance, go with them! They're a load of fun and super nice! They really try hard to get people involved. We ventured across the street to the Riu Tequila on our first or second night to check out the sports bar. It's quite large and has some video games and such, but it was empty so we didn't stay long. They do show some NFL games for anyone needing a football fix, and I was told they were showing a boxing match that many people asked for. On our last afternoon we went down to check out the Riu Palace Riviera Maya. This resort is newer than the RPM. The lobby is, like the RPM, gorgeous, and contains a nice little jewelry shop. The hotel itself is set up quite similar to the RPM, and when we exited the doors into the courtyard I got dejavu. Their buffet is also to the left, theater to the right, gazebo in the center, fountains in the center with palm trees lining both sides. I will say that the RPRM's pool is AWESOME. It blows the RPMs pool out of the water haha. Larger and just more gorgeous. Lounge \"chairs\" in the water? Check! It also seemed warmer. The beach looked slightly smaller and not as nice, just my opinion. I think next time we would still stay at the RPM but visit the RM for a swim! Unless the renovations come through and build a similar pool, which would be fantastic! We also ventured onto 5th Avenue about 6 times or so. We stopped at Pez Vela (I think that's what it's called), a bar that has swings (swings!) at the bar top. Their chef salad was amazing! Great pi\u00f1a colada too. For those Americans like my boyfriend who are craving American beer, they have it here! We came often so he could get his fill of Bud Light. We also ate at La Parrilla, a restaurant on 5th. It was very good, his steak was flavorful and perfectly cooked, and I got these skirt steak and chorizo kabobs that were fantastic. So good we came back again for the same thing! Regarding being haggled and bothered on 5th Ave, yes we were, and quite frequently. The store owners are constantly trying to get you into their shops, we were offered marijuana every time we were there and even offered cocaine once. We found the best thing to do is just ignore them and avoid eye contact! I pretend like I don't speak English or Spanish! ;) Overall, the RPM was worth every penny. It's clean, has a great friendly staff, and has the most gorgeous beach I have ever seen so far! Even though the food wasn't amazing we were not deterred. You're in paradise, nothing should spoil your mood with the quality of service you'll be receiving and the gorgeous sights you'll be feasting your eyes on!

My wife and I stayed here two years ago as a special treat for our fortieth wedding anniversary. We liked it so much that we had to return,and we intend to come back next year all being well. If you want to relax at the pool or on the beach you will enjoy the tranquil setting. If you like to be active the entertainment staff will provide plenty of fun and games in a very friendly spirit to pass the day. They are very hard working as are all the hotel staff and continue entertaining till around 10 PM. The evening shows in the theatre are a bit samey,but there again it's not Las Vegas although they are very enjoyable especially the Mexican culture shows. We see in some other reviews complaints about the food.We found plenty of variety and always well cooked,for example beef steaks arrived exactly as ordered,no language problems. Omelettes made with all the trimmings in around 30 seconds. For a day out my favorite excursion is on the FAT CAT catamaran from Puerto Adventura. Party boat trip with plenty of drinks and a packed lunch with a snorkel swim in a shallow area with a coral reef where we saw a turtle,stingray and barracuda etc. swimming just below us. Back to the hotel,this is not a Club hotel and if you are looking to party-party all day and night you might find this hotel too quiet for you. If you like peaceful polite refinement without being stuffy this is the place. Any faults that cropped up were dealt with by reception very quickly e.g.on arrival the air conditioning in our room was noisy,my wife who has very good hearing thought that sleep would be impossible,I phoned the desk and went for dinner.When we returned it had been fixed to perfection with absolutely no inconvenience. One little drawback,the atmosphere when we were there was very humid and although there are clothes drying facilities on the balcony our smalls were still damp after days hanging out and never dried completly.the other option was the laundry open monday to friday.

We arrived at the Cancun airport early in the morning, briefly waited for our transportation and arrived at the RIU Mexico Palace around 10:00 a.m. Our bags were taken by a very friendly staff member with a big smile who took us to the front desk. The lobby was quite impressive and clean. We were told by the man at the front desk that our room would not be ready until 3:00 p.m. He informed us that we would have room #52. After reading prior reviews, I asked if we could have the 2nd or 3rd floor. He didn\u2019t seem too happy but said he would see what he could do. We were directed to a changing room where we could change clothes and begin to enjoy the amenities. We were not greeting with a \u2018welcome drink\u2019 as some other guests described in their reviews. I actually thought the man at the front desk was cold and impersonal. After hanging out at the beach we decided to check back in at the front desk around 1:00 p.m. and at the slight chance our room would be ready. We were then told that \u2018we were one of the lucky ones\u2019 and that our room was ready. We were taken to room #1143 on the 2nd floor. We were given two keys, so I\u2019m not sure why other reviews mentioned they only got one. The room is average, but clean. Toiletries were supplied, stocked mini bar (Vodka, Run, Tequila, Scotch, water, soda and beer). The bed was 2 doubles pushed together but it wasn\u2019t an issue. There was a balcony, but unfortunately we had a high wall and if you were sitting in the chairs, you could not see over it and enjoy the courtyard view. Towels were always provided as well as the restocking of the mini bar. We always left a couple dollars for house keeping, since they always did a good job. A couple of \u2018towel animals\u2019 were left for us which was a nice little surprise. We did not experience a nightly turn down service. It is a little noisy. The folks upstairs got up between 6:00 a.m. and 6:30 a.m. everyday and it sounded like they were tap dancing and rolling marbles on the floor. We were actually told by a visiting travel agent that we were on the \u2018renovated side\u2019, which if facing the beach, is on the left. To be honest I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to stay on the \u2018un-renovated side\u2019. Beach is beautiful and clean. Clear turquoise water, small waves not enough to knock you down. Plenty of chairs and palm trees, you don\u2019t have to be there at 8:00 a.m. to get a spot. The pool was ice cold. Chairs around the pool seem to go quickly. Not sure why since hardly anyone was in the water. We are beach people, so we didn\u2019t spend much time at the pool. There is a bar for the pool and one for the beach. They also come around and serve drinks to you at both. The playmakers would come around and announce what was going on, so you had the option to join in or not. The same time every day, was the same activity. There was volleyball, bocce ball, darts, dancing, bingo, water aerobics and rifle shooting. There is an activity listing at the desk/both where the towels are given out. We noticed that on Thursday\u2019s, there is a kitchen tour. This was pretty interesting to see the \u2018behind the scene\u2019s\u2019. You are given 2 towel cards (per couple) for 2 towels. If you want more, sorry. But they always had fresh towels available for exchange. The fitness center is small a couple treadmills, elliptical, bikes, stair climber and some weights. Some days it was crowded and others I was the only one in there. We tried getting a kayak one afternoon, but it was an hour wait. It didn\u2019t seem like they had too many water sports equipment available. I must say that the service was very good. Everyone (with the exception of the guy checking us in) was very professional starting at the top all the way down to the landscapers. Everyone seemed to be happy to be there and willing to help with whatever you needed. Everywhere you looked someone was cleaning something. A huge difference from some of the other islands I have been to. Yamir was very helpful with the restaurants reservations, along with restaurant service itself. Evening activities were pretty low key. It was pretty good for us, since we hang at the beach all day and are pretty tired by midnight anyway. Just would be nice for a little more interaction in the evening. We only watched Grease as far as the shows go. We listened to one band where they got the guests involved with balloons, which was fun. I must say the most fun evening was Mexican Day (Wednesday). They had different types and shots of tequila. We walked to Playa del Carmen which took about 20 minutes on a safe paved sidewalk. Town was pretty cool, which had lots of shops and restaurants. Some locals even had their pet iguana, monkey and lion cub (yes lion) available for photo opportunities. For breakfast and lunch we went to the buffet which was pretty good. Pretty much the same food, every day, except for a couple different sides. Dinner buffet seemed to be much better that the other 4 specialty restaurants (which surprised me!). Don\u2019t get me wrong, they were good but not exceptional. For those restaurants you had to make reservations \u2013 for that day only, starting at 8:30 a.m. You had to choose between a 6:30 or 8:30 seating. If you don\u2019t get there early, you won\u2019t get a choice, if you even get to go at all. Personally I didn\u2019t especially care for this type of set up. We did go across the street to the RIU which had a sports bar to watch football on Sunday. It didn\u2019t get very busy, but there were a few fans in there to make it fun. We also checked out the lobby and had a drink at the RIU Playacar (very small and unimpressive) and Riu Riviera Maya. This one had a much larger and more impressive lobby. It seemed to have a younger crowd (30-55) than the Mexico Palace. The Mexico Palace either had very young (20\u2019s) or very mature (50\u2019s +). All in all I could not really complain about anything. But at the same time nothing made me say \u201cWOW\u201d, except for the service. Not sure I\u2019d go back since there are so many other resorts to explore, but I\u2019d possibly refer this to an older couple.", "Date": "November 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cThe Service is What Makes This Place Stand Out\u201d", "Author": "ChicagoSlim", "ReviewID": "UR120718654", "Content": "This is my second trip to the Riu Palace Mexico. Last year, we went in early July. The weather was just about unbearably hot and humid every day. This year, we went in early November. The weather was PERFECT. Mid-80's and sunny to partly cloudy every day and the ocean temperature was warmer than I was expecting. I must say that there is some truth to the negative comments posted here. There is a musty smell in the lobby that only seemed to be noticable on our first day...but it's there. The rooms on the ground floor seem to smell a lot more musty that the rooms on the upper floors. We were on an upper floor this year. The resort looks lovely in the pictures, but parts of it looks a bit dated and worn when you look up close. We heard that this hotel is closing for some renovations next year. With those caveats, the bottom line with this place is that the service is absolutely outstanding. Everyone is friendly including the front desk, the waiters/waitresses, the housekeeping staff, the groundskeeping staff.....everyone. You're not going to wait more that a minute or two after even thinking about another drink, etc. without someone asking to help you. I made sure that I tipped everyone early in the week....but the service didn't vary whether you tipped or not. It was all outstanding. Men actually do have to wear long pants to dinner...they are serious about that one. The food is really good. I didn't even bother with the theme restaurant reservations this year. All reservations are either at 6:30 PM or 8:45 PM. 6:30 is a little too early for us, and 8:45 is a little too late. One of the waiters actually remembered us from last year. That was nice. One thing I didn't know from last year is that you can rent bicycles from the front of the Riu Tequilla across the street. It was $5 US per bike for a half-day rental. You can ride a few laps around Playacar and work up an appetite for the buffet at night. All in all....great place. We walked up to the Riu Palace Riveria Maya, and while it did look a bit more spiffy, it seemed overcrowded and noisey.

I'll keep it short, but I went to this hotel, spent two weeks there and had the most amazing time ever, the hotel more than lived up to expectations and is still (in my opinion) the best hotel I've ever been to (The Krystal restaurent probably did this for me, as did the fact we had a junior suite).

The grounds were beautiful and well-maintained, and the layout of the resort flowed nicely. We especially liked the outside courtyard concept and it was nice sitting at one of the many tables listening to entertainment in the evenings. The hotel lobby and all but one outside restaurant are air conditioned so if you are visiting in the summer this is a major plus. The food was okay and the four a-la-carte restaurants offered two seatings: 6:30 and 8:45. We had no problem making a reservation each day. The wait staff at the restaurants worked together to take orders and each course was served in tandem, which takes away the personal touch and service. In addition, the appetizers are pre-determined and served to your table. You only had a choice of your entree as well as dessert , which needed to be ordered with your entree. We were never offered coffee with dessert. This system is no fault of the staff, as they had to get everyone served and out to get ready for the next seating. We were expecting a little more in this area because of the \"palace\" name, as we stayed at a competing \"palace\" resort a few years ago the food and service was a cut above other all-inclusive hotels. All in all, the hotel is in a great location and you can take long walks on the beach or visit any of the other four Riu properties which are a short walk away. On a personal note, we probably will not return to another Riu property because we have had more personalized service in the restaurants at other all-inclusives and their system for dinner appears to be the norm for all Riu hotels, as we have stayed at two others.", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington Court House, Ohio, United States", "Title": "\u201c11/1/11 - 11/11/11 stay at Riu Palace Mexico\u201d", "Author": "Linda W", "ReviewID": "UR120497070", "Content": "I do not want to expound on the negatives that you have read; some of them are correct - there is no light in the shower, there is only one elevator, the resort is older, the lobby area does smell a bit musty. BUT who spends a lot of time indoors or in the lobby when there is a wonderful beach and so many other things to do? We arrived in torrential rain on the tail end of Hurricane Rina. We were met at the front desk by smiles and apologies for the rain (like it was their fault!). Karola assisted us with the check in process and happily arranged the exact room location we requested. Our bags were at our room waiting for us when we arrived there and the room looks exactly like all the pictures you have seen. Immaculate! I spilled a bottle of water on the floor on the second day and utilized one of the resorts white towels to mop it up - not a spec of dirt on the towel! The staff worked tirelessly to keep up with the water that accumulated on the stairwells (open air windows) and also on the walkways. The resort is very large and a good deal of walking is required, but it is all maintained beautifully. Our 2nd day and still some rain - but it began to clear up and we spent a little time on the beach. I must say I was disappointed with the rough water as I had thought the water was calm, but I attributed the waves to the recent storm. I was right, by the end of the week the waves had calmed tremendously and the water was very refreshing. The beach is HUGE but there are always many many lounge chairs to select from. I must say, I was also a little disappointed in the beach - lots of vendors (not pushy but asking you to purchase things many times during the day). I also thought the beach could have been kept cleaner. But it is still fantastic and you can enjoy as much sun or shade as you want thanks to the beautiful palm trees. There are hobie cats, kayaks, and boogie boards for use at no charge or you can choose parasailing or jet skis for use at a fee (I do not believe these are managed by the Riu staff). Once the rain subsided the staff returned to their normal duties of cleaning and maintaining the property. I never once saw any staff member just standing; they are moving and cleaning constantly. One day I saw someone with a brush cleaning the outside of the cement flower pots. They are constantly sweeping the sand, cleaning the fountain, trimming the shrubs, trimming the stupendous palm trees, mowing, dusting, painting, mopping......it is truly amazing. Thanks to Manuel our room was spotless each and every day with fresh towels 2X a day due to the evening turn down service. I requested specific drinks in our mini fridge and was accomodated immediately and thru out the remainder of our stay. The food at all the buffets is displayed beautifully and there is a huge selection. It is not 5 star and it is not prepared the way I am accustomed to in the States, but I could always find something to eat; actually too much to eat and I am an extremely picky eater! We ate at all the speciality restaurants and the Steakhouse was my favorite (ate there twice). Juan Luis was our waiter at Krystal and he was great - and also very entertaining. All the wait staff is the BEST - Miguel took wonderful care of us each and every morning at breakfast. And the staff preparing the omelets/eggs were great. Always smiling and happy to prepare your food any way you asked. Most of the wait staff work 12 - 14 hours a day; the person who waits on you at Don Julian for breakfast will probably wait on you at the beach buffet for lunch. Lydie takes your speciality restaurant reservations from 8:30 to 10:30 each morning and will be working at the dinner buffet at night until it closes at 10:30 PM! She is truly a jewel! Each and every staff person I saw during the day greeted me with a smile and a friendly greeting each and every time I saw them. There is a wide variety of alcohol to select from - many top shelf liquors and the bar staff will fix whatever you want however you want. The terrace is a marvelous way to end your evening - drinks while enjoying the bands provided or shopping with the vendors (prices very comparable to the shops in the Playacar and cheaper than in Playa Del Carmen). The shows are entertaining and you can enjoy them from inside the theater or you can continue to sit on the terrace with a beautiful breeze. I could go on and on with praises for this resort, but I'm sure by now you realize that I loved it here. Yes, it is older and yes there are a few issues but it is not in the USA and things are done a bit differently in every country I have ever visited. If you want things the same way you are accustomed to in the US, you are travelling to the wrong places. I felt I was treated better at this resort than at any hotel or restaurant chain I have ever visited in the US.

How anyone could find anything to complain about at RPM amazes me and I can be as objective as anyone. We have just returned from 2 weeks from 17th October - 1st November. This was our 3rd trip to this hotel - 6th time in Mexico. We keep returning because the hotel maintains its consistently high standard. From the moment we stepped off the bus and were greeted by the doorman to \"welcome home\". Its not just us that keep returning either - we have met a few friends over the years. This time there were 6 couples that we knew from previous visits. We also recognised 3 other couples over the 2 weeks and reading the reviews so many people write that its a return trip. Reception were wonderful and welcoming as we had a cool drink whilst being allocated our room. We had a lovely room at the end of one of the blocks. A huge bed - which was 2 doubles pushed together but they never moved so we had no issues at all and slept fantastically. The beds were so comfortable. The rooms are lovely. Nice and simple with a large bathroom, tiled floor throughout, bedroom area with plenty of hanging space (and hangers) and then a seating area with tv. The balcony is great and has 2 large chairs to enjoy the caribbean air (with a bacardi and coke from the optics / fridge). We dont use much of the supplied drinks - purely because we dont spend a huge time in the room and when we do it tends to be water we drink. The fridge has beer, water, coke, orange, lemonade, tonic, club soda - everything! I have always noticed that if you tend to drink diet coke then this is what is replaced with additional stock to ensure you have plenty! Nice thoughtful touch. The staff at the hotel throughout work constantly to ensure it is spotless. There is a smell throughout but then its the caribbean and the air conditioning is on constantly. To be honest its not something we notice until we get home and open our case - but the clothes are going in the wash and its really not anything awful. Again - you are not at home - expect something a little different that is all! We tend to mainly eat in the buffet as the food is delicious with so much choice that this suits us. We can eat then as and when we are ready. We did eat at the steakhouse and that was lovely and nice to have the special service for 1 evening. There is so much choice in the buffet which is where we ate breakfast and evening meal. The fresh omelettes are so nice that I had this, fruit and yoghurt each day. The choices varied from 10 cereal options, pastries, toast, pancakes, waffles, eggs a multitude of ways, sausage, bacon, salad, ham, cheese. In the evening a huge salad bar with all salad types, pastas, sushi, cold meats and fish, cheese, fruit. The hot area with varying choices of meat and vegetable, pasta and fish. And always some form of speciality whether mexican wraps made fresh and to your choice or roast joints, whole fish or pasta stations. There would always be pizza and chips too if that was more suited. The dessert area also has a huge array of choices but my favourite was the fresh crepes with flambe fruit. We chose to eat lunch in the pool restaurant and again we never had any issues on choosing something delicious to eat. The waiting staff are amazing and go out of their way to make your stay all the more special. Joel looked after us at breakfast and remembered us from last year (and that we loved the hazelnut cappucinos), Abraham was so helpful with information if we asked and made sure we had water waiting at our table at lunch and German in the evening who set our table with flowers each evening. The bar staff are just the same and if you tend to order similar drinks they will remember each evening. We love the cocktails and there is more than enough alcohol in these. If you want more just ask - nothing is too much trouble. If you want a branded drink ask for it - if you ask for vodka and coke you will understandably get the local brand. The beach area has plenty of sun loungers and lots of palm trees which provide shade of varying degrees if you need. The sea can be rough at times but its great for body boarding on these days (borrow boards, cannoes, snorkels from the beach team). If you want to book a trip id recommend doing from the beach team. Have to say they seem to know if its not your thing and never hassle us - we are happy just to relax and they seem to pick up on this straight away but its good to know who to ask if we did. Weve stayed in Cancun a couple of times but prefer Playacar. We enjoy walking into town in the evening and having a beer in one of the bars or just a walk round the shops. The people there do pester you to have a look inside which is a shame as im sure they would get more business if they didnt. The shopping area has grown incredibly since our first visit in 2006 and has some good shops, bars and restaurants. You can also catch the ferry to Cozumel from here. While we were there we did have Hurrican Rina threaten. The staff were amazing and must have been at work all night to prepare. Everything was boarded and fastened down and sandbags placed along the walkways to try to keep the water at bay. We were given packed lunches for our rooms as the storm was expected at lunch time.

We had a great ground floor room toward the front (room 0148) near the restaurants and night life facing the beautiful court yard. We were scheduled to leave on the 27th but due to hurricane Rina our flight was canceled and we had to extend our stay for three days. This was not a problem until the assistant manager told us we had to move to a lower class Riu hotel down the street. After a good part of the day this was a finally resolved and we were allowed to stay at the Riu Palace Mexico. Other than the hurricane and assistant manager in no particular order, we highly recommend the Riu Mexico and the Riu Palace Riviera Maya. We normally visit one of the Riu Palace hotels about four to five times a year. All the other staff are great and I do tell them that it's because of them that we continue to return. All the good reviews are accurate no need to hear over again, but I will add that if you plan to visit in the next fees weeks you will probably find the pool water getting to cold to enjoy. The ocean was still maintaining comfortable temperature of about 79-82 degrees. The nights will be more comfortable with light jacket or sweater. If you need anything in the Dinning rooms ask for Giovanni the head captain, we is the best. If you like the late night conversation try the lobby bar at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya. Theirs Islas the best bar tender in town, tell him the Baby Boomer sent you. Also at the Maya is the 24 hour sports bar where you usually find the same late night die hards. Personality wise the mexico is a little more laid back with more Europeans where the riviera Maya is more up beat and more U.S. Either way the staff will make you feel at home.

Have been traveling to Mexico for yearly vacations for 10 years, and this was our 8th time in Riviera Maya area. Have always stayed at different all-inclusive resorts and this was our first time at the RPM. Check-in: Painless. Desk staff was very friendly and gave us a great room. Not a fan of having actual keys, not key cards, as they can charge you if you lose it. We never did, but another guest came for an additional key since they lost theirs and they were told they would have to make them another one, at a $15 or $20 charge. The desk staff was very thorough in explaining where everything was, how the reservations for dinner worked, etc. This doesn't always happen at resorts and you have to spend a couple of days figuring everything out, so I appreciated the explanation. Room: We had a second-floor room on the courtyard/fountain side, close to the pool - 1052 and 1053. Great rooms and views at this location. The rooms are a little dated compared to some resorts we have stayed at, but they weren't that bad. Yes...two full beds moved together to make a larger bed, which was annoying. No light in the shower. Great tv with a variety of channels, many US channels, which was great since we were there during Hurricane/Tropical Storm Rina. Housekeeping: Great. Always prompt and well-done. Mini-bar was always well-stocked, and when I requested additional items to make sure we would have plenty when the storm hit, they gave me everything I requested on my note. Food: Restaurants - Steak House was our favorite, but I wasn't too impressed with Japanese and Krystal. They were okay, but I didn't love them. We did not get a chance to eat at the Brazilian restaurant. We ate at the buffet more on this trip than any other, and it was great. Towards the end of the 10 days, I was a little \"over\" the food, but that was not a reflection on what they offered....we were just a little \"full!\" We only ordered room service for wine and coffee, but the menu was not very impressive. Always nice to have the option, though. Breakfast and lunch buffets were great. Pool: I'm a big \"pool person,\" and this one was not one of the best I have been to. We spent most of our time on the side near the pool bar. It was great having drink service to our chairs, and those servers worked very hard. The pool itself needs some work....a little dated and in need of repainting, patching, etc. I also like when they play music in the pool area and I think they only had one playlist that they used every day....current music for aqua aerobics, then traditional Mexican music for the rest of the day. By the last day, we knew all of the songs by heart :-) Beach: The beach was great. Plenty of chairs and room for everyone. Quite a few feet of the beach was eroded away after Rina hit. Waiters would bring large trays of an array of drinks down to the beach, and that was a great service. The beach bar was not very impressive. Very small and short-staffed, so you had to wait a while for service. Since it seemed that most guests chose the beach over the pool at this resort, I think they need to re-think their bar service. There would be 4-7 people working the pool bar, and 1-3 working the beach bar. Activities: Pretty basic. The activity team was really nice and did a great job, but this resort was a little light in this department compared to other resorts we have been to. Cindy was our favorite....always took the time to talk to us. Evening Activities/Shows: I'm usually not a big show person, but we ended up seeing most of them due to the layout of this hotel, and where we ended up after dinner. They were very similar to other resorts and we enjoyed them. They played some games in the courtyard some nights before the shows, and those were fun. Casino Night was especially popular. Tropical Storm Rina: In the early stages of this storm, I was a little frustrated with the communication, or lack of, by the hotel to the guests as to what was happening. It got a little confusing and chaotic, as some people heard some things, but others heard something different. We actually had a desk employee tell us that we would be put on a bus and sent to a local school until the storm passed! I think there might have been a slight language barrier during that conversation, but needless to say, that was a little concerning. We checked with the desk the following morning and were told that was not going to happen, based on what the current strength of the storm was projected to be. In the end, I can see that the hotel was just making sure they had all of their \"ducks in a row\" before issuing any formal statements, and at that point, the hurricane was downgraded to a tropical storm. When there was more clarity as to the severity of the storm, I feel the hotel did a great job in making sure we were safe and comfortable. We had to go to our rooms at 12:30 on Thursday and we were sent with a bag lunch....not a great lunch, but we all could easily afford to miss a meal after 7 days of all-inclusive :-) The storm ended up hitting at around 7pm, and at that point, we were at dinner at the buffet. There was thunder, lightning, and rain, but the hotel set up casino games in the lobby, opened the buffet for dinner, and held the show in the theater. All was fine...a little wet, but fine. Overall, it was a great trip and we were happy with the resort. I would possibly go back, if the price was right. I liked the smaller size compared to some of the mega-resorts we have stayed at in the past. It is nice to have the option of utilizing the other sister resorts if we get bored with ours, but we never really did. I only gave the resort 4 stars because I have stayed at the Royal Playa del Carmen, and I don't think this one is equal to where I would rate the Royal.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aberdeen, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Hotel\u201d", "Author": "guest79963", "ReviewID": "UR119872572", "Content": "The best hotel i have ever been in.

We were given a key to our room, a basement level \"Jr Suite\", which faced a \"garden\" area. It had a small outside area, but that was probably the best part. The room smelled so bad (of mold/must/and the heavy chemical cleaners), that we couldn't stay in it. The room was also DATED!!! The comforter was OLD, the drapes were OLD, everything about this room was OLD and depressing. We asked the desk to see another room, and we did, but it was equally terrible for the same reasons.

The hotel itself is very beautiful, and the warm, tropical environment provided a magnificent backdrop. The beach area \u2013 with all the palm trees, hammocks, and chairs \u2013 looked like something out of a movie set. We were unfortunate enough to be there for 5 days of heavy rain, so I didn\u2019t get to experience the clear, blue waters that I\u2019ve heard so much about (or the sun for that matter). The tropical depression that hung around all week made the surf dark brown with all the sand being churned up from the waves (which also happened to be much too rough for my comfort zone.) Our room was spacious enough and I loved the detailed work put into the tile and woodwork, especially in the bathroom. The small fridge was nicely stocked with sodas, beer and plenty of water. The TV worked great and there were many channels to choose from. The air conditioning in the room also worked perfectly (as long as you knew what temperature you wanted in Celsius.) There were three things that I did not particular like about the hotel, the most notable being the smell. Our room smelled of mold so bad that it gave me a headache within 5 minutes and kept me awake at night. It is the worst smelling hotel room I\u2019ve ever been in; it reminded me of an old dirt cellar or the old canvas tent we had stored out in our shed when I was a kid. The same smell was in parts of the main restaurant and a few other places as well. I must say that I was fascinated by the fact that some guests obviously could not smell this, because there was no way I could have eaten in that wing of the restaurant. I got to where I couldn\u2019t even walk through the back entrance to the restaurant because it was too overpowering and would give me an instant headache. The second thing is that we were made a little uneasy by all the knocks on the door from room service bringing us water or such that we never requested. I could see a mistake once or twice, but this happened too many times for it to be a coincidence. I got the impression they were looking for rooms where no one was in. The final thing that did not go well for us was that my husband got food poisoning on the second night we were there. We ate at Krystals and he had ordered the sea bass (which we\u2019ve since learned that you should not eat anyway) and it was so salty that he could only get down two or three bites before he was pretty sure something wasn\u2019t quite right with it. Less than two hours after dinner his illness began. Today is day 7 and he is still sick and can\u2019t eat anything without being near a bathroom. He has an appointment Monday with our doctor. (We did not drink any tap water and only ate at the resort restaurants.) And for what it\u2019s worth, the rain seeped into our living area all week and we had to keep towels on the floor. This was a problem throughout the resort due to all the rain. If you go I would request a room on the 2nd or 3rd floor.

The next day we went to management to ask what had happened and they acted like they didnt know what we were talking about. After being persistant about it we were then taken to a room and told the man was okay but that we were the only suspects and that they werent going to press charges because there wasnt enough evidence. I was like you have got to be kidding me. Once again I was in tears on my vacation. My husband told me to let it go because we are in Mexico and they could pretty much do what ever they wanted to.

I am not sure what all the glowing reviews are for, perhaps, there was a special hyponitizing tonic being served on the property that made people believe this place was some sort of paradise, when it was quite the opposite. When we arrived on October 15th @ 12:15, in pouring torrential rain, we were welcomed into an overcrowded, leaking lobby with a mildew smell and no seating available.The furniture seats were so old that the couches had huge dents & were sunken in. Upon attempting to check in, we asked if the desk clerk could just check to see if any rooms were avail. for early check in, however, we were immediately dismissed as she kept pointing to a sign that said 3 o clock! How rude, we just wanted to check as we were in soaking clothes & very uncomfortable. The fact that she would not even check the system to see if there was a room, is what was infuriatiing. So we were left to stand in a smelly lobby, with ugly plastic buckets to catch water from the leaking celiing & no seating available. We finally went downstairs in the meantime to kill some time and try to have a meal. We were again in an overcrowded waiting area, waiting for the mediocre buffet to open. Why only 1 eating place open for lunch? When we finally checked in nearly 3 hours later, we were given a key--a key? in 2011? not a key card, to a room that was downstairs in the lower level. The room door opened and we were welcomed with a strong mildew smell, 2 beds pushed together? This is their idea of a double room? To beds pushed together as if it were one king bed? We wanted 2 separate beds. The beds has ugly faded blue, then bed spreads--not comforters--thin bed spreads. After sleeping, we missed the dinner buffet & ordered 'room service'. Uh, nice menu? Mostly cold items--turkey sandwich, a salad, etc. The food arrived with no trays or food covers, the turkey sandwich was inedible with spongy, stale like bread, dry turkey, and no cheese, as they told me on the phone that they had no cheese, only cheesecake?? The next morning, when sitting in bed looking up, I see the air vent in the upper right of the ceiling has mold growing around it! Disgusting! The bed spread has slipped off & when I picked it up, I noticed a huge brown stain on the lower left side of the box spring. Travelers biggest fear, a dirty mattress. We still tried to see if Day 2 was in better, but no! I almost slipped in the hallway because of the water seaping from the ceiling, we went out for a bit and came back @3:15. We went to our room to find our clothes were wet because of the leaking ceiling in the room. We tried to see if we could get food as we were hungry, however, the buffet was closed & were told it would not be open until 6:30. No hot food was available unless, as they told us, we could walk out all the way to the back of the property in the pouring rain if we wanted hot food, or wait the 3 hours for the buffet downstairs to open--the other two restaurants were closed as well. The property should have planned for the inclement weather and had extended hours at the buffet or one of the other properties. Between rude manager, the mildew smell, mold in the room, wet clothes, plastic buckets all over the property to catch rain from the ceiling, poor access to hot food, we decided to move to a new property (at an additional charge) to salvage the last 3 days of our vacation. We will NEVER return to any RIU property--ever. We also will inform others to stay away.

Comedy!! Riu Palace was awesome. The property was breathtakingly beautiful. The service was impeccable. My wife cried when it was time to leave. But here are some tips to keep in mind if you are are ultra-picky: * Playacar is hot and humid. This isn't the hotel's fault. If you don't like hot humid weather, you won't like it here. * The tap water in this part of the world is generally not safe for people whose metabolisms aren't accustomed to it. Drink bottled water or enjoy the copious beverages at one of the many bars or from your generously stocked in-room minibar. Never give the tap water to a baby! * There are many desperately poor people in this part of the world. Occassionally, one of them will be tempted by your wealth. Management would prefer that you use the in-room safe than to deal with complaints that arise from your carelessness. * If your vacation plans center around 5 star dining, try New York or Paris or Florence. If you can't find something you like at the Riu's buffet, you have a problem. It might taste a little different from what you're used to, but remember that you're not in Kansas anymore. The variety and quantity of food was staggering. It made me feel a little guilty. How spoiled are we? * Semitropical environments (and all environments except maybe Antarctica) have insects. They weren't at all bothersome. Quite the contrary. But you might see one occassionally. I think I recall from biology class that insects serve a useful role in nature. It would be disastrous to try to eradicate all of them. This hotel was fabulous. If you don't like it here, you have some kind of special need and you should have planned better.

The weather and the resort were perfect. We booked private transfers from USA Transfer, which was much better (and only barely more expensive) than the shared shuttles we've used in the past. They were excellent. What makes RPM different is the huge expanse of property between the resort and the beach. You can't really see the water from the rooms (at least where we were), but the palm-shaded beach had hundreds of lounge chairs and hammocks, which spread guests over a larger area and eliminated any sense of crowding even though the resort was nearly full. It felt more like a tropical resort than a hotel plopped directly on a denuded beach. There are five Riu properties in the area, and guests at one can use all the facilities at any of the others, including bars and restaurants (except dinner, where you eat at your own resort). RPM is a really pretty property, somewhat the standard Riu layout, but in an Old Mexico theme with wrought iron, stone, and mint green colors. Grounds are immaculately maintained. It's truly all-inclusive -- they didn't even ask for a credit card swipe at check-in. Most of the guests were from the UK and Germany, with few children. No obnoxious drunks that we saw, always a risk at all-inclusives that proudly advertise in-room liquor dispensers and unlimited bar service. Playacar is a secured area with guarded gates at all entrances. Quite safe, I'd say. There's a small plaza across the street with a few souvenir places and it's about a 30-minute walk to Fifth Avenue on quiet, residential sidewalks (or a fixed price $7 cab ride). Other reviews covered the obvious features, so I'll add a few. The patio of our room was huge and quite nice, with two lounge chairs -- totally private, with full walls. We weren't on the courtyard side, but that was a plus in our book - we were looking out onto palms and lawn and it was quiet. The room was nice and cool and the pushed-together bed was enormous. The only negatives were the tiny pillows and lack of bathrobes. Towel animals were fun. I watched the maid clean our room one day and it was more thorough than I would have imagined, with full dusting and mopping even though we'd barely touched the room -- she must have worked 30 minutes in there. Fun surprises: the noon beach party was cool with a live band, barbeque, drinks in coconuts, and dance lessons. The piano player evenings in the lobby bar was outstanding. Unlike our two previous all-inclusive visits, there were no timeshare pitches. Buffets were of amazing variety and excellent quality (favorites: the cheese buffet, the roast beef, ceviche,and the always-available Mexican food items). Fruit and vegetables were, as usual in Mexico, of very high quality -- I started every morning with a sandwich of tasty tomatoes and bacon on homemade bread, cinnamon rolls, and a chocolate croissant or homemade doughnut. The dinner buffet featured ice sculpture and carved vegetables, easily the equal of the midnight buffets that cruise ships once offered. Breakfasts also featured make your own mimosas, freshly made smoothies, and Kahlua coffee. Most folks took the chance to eat outside at the buffet, and service there was equally excellent to that inside. We enjoyed the Miyagi and Fusion specialty restaurants, very well themed and intimate (only 40 or so seats). Service there was perfect and the food was quite nice. The best feature of this resort is the staff. They were exceedingly friendly, smiling, and efficient -- I've never seen hotel employees work so hard and diligently, but always with a smile. Even their smartly tailored uniforms were immaculate at all times. RPM has plenty of bar staff even at poolside and at the beach, so it's exceedingly easy to get a drink just about anywhere on the property. All-inclusive or not, I like to tip a dollar every round or two of drinks, a couple of dollars at dinner, and $5-10 at the specialty restaurants - it's entirely optional, but seemed to be much appreciated. Entertainment staff were fun, especially at the beach party. We only went to one show and it was pretty bad, so we left quickly -- unskilled lip-syncing and dancing to a recording of Mamma Mia! was not at all entertaining, although the show room was nice and bar service was excellent there as well. Looking back, what gave this resort an almost cruise-like feel were the shared events: casino night on the patio, the band, the shows, the beach party, and the mingling at the bars. You could simply hole away on the beach or in your room in private if you wanted, but there was a nice feeling of camaraderie that we haven't had at other all-inclusives. I could go on, but the bottom line is that we had a wonderful time, better than at Live Aqua or Royal Playa del Carmen, with the big differentiators being the friendly and efficient employees, the excellent food, and the scheduled events. That points to outstanding management - hiring and motivating the right people, quality control, and guest relations. Being part of a large organization like Riu may make that possible. Everybody has their own opinions and some of the negative ones posted here gave me cause for concern, but I have nothing at all negative to say about Riu Palace Mexico. I think they do a magnificent job and I would recommend it to others without hesitation. I'm certain guests will leave feeling as we did -- relaxed, pampered, and satisfied with excellent value received.", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas, United States", "Title": "\u201cDidn't Meet Expectations for a Palace\u201d", "Author": "Chris K", "ReviewID": "UR119233831", "Content": "I just returned from the Riu Palace Mexico on 10/11 and agree with most of what ds521 said in their own review. Last year we stayed at the Iberostar Quetzal down the street and absolutely loved our stay however were looking to \"upgrade\" a bit this year by staying at the Riu Palace Mexico. Unfortunately we didn't feel like there was a single part of this resort that was really upgraded over the Iberostar Quetzal besides maybe some higher end boozs (though quetzal had this available at many of there bars and the bartenders only used it at the Riu if you asked for it). Food: One the things that I was most looking forward to on this stay was an upgrade in the food which many reviewers talked about at the Palace Mexico. We were however very disappointed in what we found. Breakfast was decent offering all the basics (eggs, bacon, some pasteries, etc.) though nothing was executed incredibly well. The French toast was dry, the eggs were hit or miss, and there breads/pasteries were nothing special. The cereal was also stale which was disappointing. The one nice thing was an extensive juice/smothie bar which we enjoyed. Lunch was probably one of the most disappointing meals of the day. At both restaurants/eating areas they had mostly fried foods or the typical grilled meat strips or hamburgers with the same prepackaged desserts which you saw at every meal. Even things as basic as the nacho cheese were kind of chunky and unappealing. For dinner we ate at three of the specialty restaurants (Japanese, Fusion/Krystal, and the stakehouse) as well as the buffet. The buffet was nothing special and I actually think the dinner buffet at the Iberostar down the street was much more elaborate and well done. We enjoyed our dinner at the fusion restaurant, thought the japanese was OK, and were very dissappointed int eh steakhouse. The baked Alaska they have there is cool but the actual meat is very mediocre. Also what killed me was that the \"Fine potato chips with parmigiana and herbs\" that they served with it were just fries from the lunch buffet with some parsley sprinkled over them. All of this was just really sad since I big reason we choose this resort over going back to Quetzal was because of the food and overall I would say the food at Quetzal was actually superior. The room service was also pretty sad with only a few pre-made options that you wouldn't want to order anyway. Beach: The beach is gorgeous, though you should be able to find this at most of the resorts in the Playacar area. There were plenty of Palm trees which were nice. Grounds: Very clean and well kept which was nice. I just don't think I liked the Palace feel as much as I expected versus the jungle feel of say a Riu Tequila or the Iberostars. Entertainment: As everyone mentioned, it was pretty bad, especially compared to what we got at the Iberostar. Basically one man acts with some other staff members dancing around. The one exception to this is that they did have a casino night one evening which was really fun though it closed down rather abruptly. Staff: Everyone was very nice and helpful, no complaints. However, we didn't think there was anything which was superior to the Iberostar quetzal either. Pool: Awful. Whoever planned out this pool should not be an architect. First off its (there is only one) in a weird flower shape so you never get the feeling of being in a large resort pool which we didn;t like and is not conducive to groups. Also there was no view of anything from the pool besides the sides of the resort which was disappointing. We actually walked down the the RPRM everytime we wanted to spend some time in a pool since they have a beautiful large pool and an infinity pool which overlooks the beach. This combined with the food were probably our two biggest let downs. Rooms: Once again we were a little disappointed here. The rooms were fine though there was nothing that shouted \"palace\" about them. Pretty normal and comparable to our rooms at the Iberostar quetzal except these had a little lowered seating area. The one thing that was much worse about these rooms was the bathrooms. The shower/bath was incredibly narrow and didn't have a light in it! Last year we loved our large glass door shower at Quetazal which felt very luxurious. This shower felt like it belonged in a motel 8. Our room was also not cleaned one day which was pretty annoying and unexpected for a Palace. Overall, if you have never been to an all-inclusive resort before, you'll probably enjoy yourself here. We however were very disappointed due to our expectations and what we feel we could have got with similar money at an Iberostar resort. We didn't feel like there was much that made this place very special or desirable for future visits. If I were to stay at a Riu again in Playa it would be the RPRM since there pool is infinitely better (though the food is just as disappointing) and it just seemed much livelier. Overall the resort just seemed a bit dated and average for what is suppose to be the Flagship line of Riu resorts.", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "East Sussex, England", "Title": "\u201cAMAZING\u201d", "Author": "Tiggs26", "ReviewID": "UR119155198", "Content": "I have just returned from another fabulous holiday in this amazing hotel I have been here about 7/8 times The staff are so friendly and helpful and cannot do enough for you.

The rooms, no matter where located are all excellent, some have views of the fountains or the pool which obviously adds to the view if you like to sit out on the balcony. The pool is exceptionally clean and lovely and warm. They clean the rails and showers every day, the down side being that there is sometimes odd bits of rubbish or glasses left out from the day before, but people staying here could help that situation as there are bins every where. The area itself is clean though The food is excellent and there is ample to chose from. You could have a completely different meal every night if you wanted, and I stayed for 3 weeks!! The speciality restaurants are also excellent although the Brazilian is not my personal choice. The shows are typical hotel shows but you can really enjoy them if get into the spirit. There was some different entertainment this year and we had a casino night. They gave you chips and then what you won was turned into a cheque and you could bid at an \"auction\" for prizes.....great fun. Your drinks are kept topped up all the time often without asking and they remember what you \"normally\" drink. The shopping is close by too at the plaza, or you can get a taxi for $7 to 5th Avenue. Most of the entertainment staff were new this year but they worked extremely hard and were really friendly. A couple of comments I woud make are that:- - they need additional steps into the pool that are not quite so steep - They need to make the signs more prominent in the quiet pool that state no airbeds or balls as these rules were ignored - Men are supposed to wear long trousers in all restaurants but they were being let in with shorts even in the speciality restaurants, unfair on those men that made the effort NONE of this affected our holiday and was not a problem to us Can't wait to go back again next year.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Niles, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cDidn't live up to our expectations...\u201d", "Author": "ds521", "ReviewID": "UR119117146", "Content": "We just returned from a one week stay at this resort and we hope that this review will be as helpful as other reviews have been to us. We flew into the Cancun airport without any problems via Continental, and it took about an hour to clear immigration, etc. We booked Cancun Express and prepaid our private transfer for $94 for the roundtrip for my husband and me. I recommend this company \u2013 they are very reliable and reasonable, and you can\u2019t beat the price for a private transfer \u2013 no stopping along the way to deliver others to their hotels first\u2026. We stayed at the Riu Tequila in 2010 so we were somewhat familiar with the Riu Palace Mexico since it\u2019s across the street. The Palace Mexico is much more lavish than the Tequila \u2013 the lobby is very ornate with its beautiful chandeliers, wrought iron arches and detailing, etc. The staff at the front desk was very nice \u2013 our room wasn\u2019t ready at 1:30 so we went down and had lunch. At 2:30 our room was ready and we were given a 2nd floor room that faced the pool area. I had emailed a request prior to arrival for a 2nd or 3rd floor room and they honored that request. We also mentioned that we would be celebrating my husband's birthday as well as our anniversary while there, but neither event was acknowledged at any time throughout the week. We also asked for 2 room keys and that wasn\u2019t a problem. The room was very nice, air-conditioner worked well, and it was a good sized room with a lower level living area. As others have stated, the bed is a bit hard but we didn\u2019t have a problem sleeping. As some have reported, the room is a bit dated \u2013 especially the bedding looked worn. Upon arrival, the room had rose petals on the bed in the shape of a heart, and there were 3 towel animals also. There was one other day that a towel animal was made and placed in our bathroom. That was the extent of the towel animals and rose petals. I know some people have said this was a daily occurrence in their experiences but that wasn\u2019t the case with us. There was 1 day when the room wasn\u2019t cleaned at all. It wasn\u2019t a big deal for us though \u2013 since there are just the two of us, we just needed a couple extra towels and wash clothes. As nice as it was to have a furnished balcony that was close to the pool, it wasn\u2019t functional for us. The balcony wall was so high that you could not sit out there and see anything but the sky \u2013 literally not even the tree tops could be seen when sitting on that balcony. Not all balconies were like this at the Palace Mexico so if you enjoy sitting on the balcony like we do, you might want to make this clear when reserving your room. It was a negative for us \u2013 we didn\u2019t enjoy the balcony at all on this trip. The grounds at this resort are gorgeous and meticulously maintained \u2013 you won\u2019t find a cleaner hotel, that\u2019s for sure, and to be sure, it does look palatial. The staff are very friendly and helpful \u2013 no matter if you tip or don\u2019t tip. One of the main complaints I have with the Riu Palace Mexico though is that everything is so far from the ocean. To walk to the water\u2019s edge from the main hotel area is no less than the length of 3 (three) football fields. I have to agree with some who have complained about the amount of walking that\u2019s required when you stay at this resort \u2013 it can be a problem for anyone with joint problems or for the elderly. We really didn\u2019t enjoy the pool there at all \u2013 it\u2019s beautiful but you cannot see or hear the ocean when you\u2019re at the pool. As a matter of fact, unless you\u2019re sitting beyond the tree line of the beach, you won\u2019t be able to hear waves. This is not a resort that structures many activities around the beach. They do have beach volleyball, etc. but if you\u2019re like us and enjoy beach activities both day and night \u2013 you might want to look at other resorts. We\u2019ve stayed at resorts that have Mexican Fiestas, Big Screen Movie Nights and Football Game nights, Fire Shows, etc., etc. on the beach at night \u2013 this resort has absolutely nothing on the beach in the way of entertainment and except for volleyball, has little else during the day. On the subject of the pool, it\u2019s very weird \u2013 the only way to get in or out of that beautiful pool is by ladder. There is no zero entry \u2013 no steps with handrails. They gave no thought to small children or anyone who has any disability or who is older, and these ladders don\u2019t extend to the bottom of the pool \u2013 you really have to hoist yourself up to reach that first step when you\u2019re trying to get out. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this in any public pool and especially not in a resort pool. We disliked the beach/pool setup so much that we walked even further each day to the Riu Yucatan next door so that we could use their seating around the pool that actually overlooked the ocean. This was fine \u2013 the pools are great there and the view of the turquoise Caribbean and Cozumel are perfect - but we paid for the bar service at the Palace. Unfortunately, the less expensive Yucatan has no bar service poolside, you have to go and wait in line to get a drink. It also was inconvenient at lunch time because we had to trek back over to the Palace \u2013 the lunch at the Yucatan was very mediocre at best, and if you eat too late, it consists of an odd assortment of unidentifiable mush. We found the food at the breakfast, lunch, and dinner buffet at the Palace to be just ok. They did have shrimp a couple of nights and that was good, the beef was tough most often, the salmon very dry, the desserts very repetitive and gelatinous. They seem to offer menu items geared more to the European tastes rather than to the Americans, and maybe it\u2019s because they seem to have more Europeans than Americans staying there. We actually liked the food at the specialty restaurants better \u2013 the steakhouse/El Patio was probably our favorite. The Krystal was good and the Brazilian was pretty good too. We didn\u2019t try the Asian restaurant though so we can\u2019t comment on that. We found the entertainment at the Palace to be really disappointing. I know others have said the same thing but we\u2019re not big partiers and are pretty easily entertained, but we were just plain bored at this place. We went across the street to the Tequila and they at least had enjoyable entertainment that included audience participation. We were both very surprised by the amount of smokers on this trip. There weren\u2019t many Americans who stayed at this resort \u2013 most visitors being from the UK, Germany, etc. but it was shocking to see how many of them smoke like it was still 1955 when we were still clueless about the dangers of smoking. It\u2019s so rare in the US to be exposed to cigarette smoke nowadays \u2013 with so many laws that protect the non-smokers, it was really hard for us to deal with all that toxic smoke. We won\u2019t be staying at this resort again. The staff is very good and very friendly but I think the management needs to rethink what many people look for when planning a beach vacation. The fountains and d\u00e9cor are beautiful but we can get that in NYC. It\u2019s about the beach, the food, the entertainment\u2026\u2026there are so many great resorts in that area that offer a complete beach vacation experience and there\u2019s no reason to settle for less. Midway into the week we found ourselves - for the first time on any vacation - considering moving to one of those resorts to finish out the trip. This is not to say, by any means, that this is a bad place \u2013 it\u2019s not. But it just falls short in areas that are important to us when we\u2019re looking for a great beach vacation. Hopefully, this review will help you get a better idea of what the resort is like. These are our opinions and based on the viewer ratings \u2013 some people out there likes this resort to be sure. As long as you understand what it does and does not offer, you\u2019ll hopefully be less likely to be in for any disappointments. Have a great time \u2013 wherever you do stay.

I would recommend a third floor room. The floors are tile (which I like) but people walking upstairs is very loud. We switched rooms after night one to a third floor. The beds were firm. Only Negative- The gym smelled horrible. You will need to walk to the Yucatan which is next door. Their equipment is a little old but ok. Still much much better that the Palace Mexico. The rest of the trip... Ground transportation from the airport to Playa del Carmen. When coming from the airport take the ADO bus.They are huge-brand new Mercedes buses. There is a bus coming to and from the airport to Playa about every 45 minutes. The bus is about $10/person each way. Also the ADO bus goes to Cancun every 15 minutes for about $3.50 each way. We took the ADO bus to Tulum for a day trip. It was about $5 each way and $5 entry fee into Tulum. We bought a round trip ticket with the return ticket open. This means you can take whatever time you want on the return. The bus does have assigned seats. Check your ticket for assigned seats. Ask to sit near the front, so you can see the movie they show. Plus you get a better view. FYI- when in Tulum, we asked one of the vendors the price of a cold coconut, he told us the price and then proceeded to cut open the coconut, when all we did was ask about the price. The price was too high and we started to leave. He called the police saying we had ordered the coconut, we were stealing. Moral of the story- beware of the cold coconut vendors and their $3 little scam. I was a little scared, with him calling the police and the unfairness of the whole situation. I am not one to ruffle feathers or cause a scene which is why I walked away with the tyrant following me. I tried to not let it ruin my day, but it is hard to forget. PS the police never came. Fifth ave- Overrated and the street vendors are a bit much The one pearl I did find was at Yaxche with Filo as our waiter. Be sure to ask for Filo! The cuisine is authentic Mayan food-which I have never had but now love. The place feels like you are eating in a candle lit, romantic tree house. Be sure to ask for a table upstairs. For about $50 we had appetizers, drinks and each a lovely dinner. My partner had pork with candied onions and corn torillas. Fantastic! I hope this has been helpful, please forgive any typos. Hope you enjoy your trips, say hello to Filo for me!

The Riu palace Mexico is in the Yucatan peninsula. Riviera Maya is an of the Yucatan Peninsula south of Cancun and it is similar to \u201cthe Midwest\u201d in the states = Rivera Maya is just an area. This resort is just outside of the City of Playa Del Carmen, in a gated community called Playacar. All traffic is stopped at the gates to make sure that they actually have business there to get in. The Riu Palace Mexico is one of six total Riu resorts that you will have access to. The Riu Palace Riveria Maya, Riu Tequilla, Riu Yucatan, Riu Playacar, and Riu Lupita. Please see below for more info. My perspective- We have stayed at 5 all inclusives in Mexico and one in the Dominican. This was by far the best. We are a couple in our early 30\u2019s and travelled with another couple for this one. We stayed 5 nights and travelled out of St. Louis on a 2 \u00bd hour charter flight and paid 549.00 before taxes for the five nights, so we feel this hotel was a steal. Check in- The palaces are the only two that have an air conditioned lobby which is much appreciated. The lobby was very nice. We were greeted with a drink, and they overviewed the property-gave us info on what restaurants were open at what times, where the bars were, spa, etc. I had sent an email to palace.mexico@riu.com prior to arriving to make reservations at a restaurant and request an upgrade. Adrian who answered the email greeted us and took care of the requests. Rooms- The rooms are spacious. They are cleaned twice a day which is great. Mostly people go to the beach, come back, then leave for dinner. They clean up any sand that you may have brought back while you are out in the evening. The bathroom is nothing special, but it does have a bidet. We did not find the bed hard. Make sure to request one mattress pad and one comforter to cover both beds if they do not provide this for you already. The AC was cold as was the fridge. There is a master switch at the front, so if you hit this you turn off the fridge so it won't be cold. The room had a walk out patio, (3rd floor) and a seating area with a flat screen TV. We had no problem with the safe. The liquor dispenser in the room is cool, but we did not use it much. No bad smells or must was noted. There is only one elevator and this is not a huge resort, but it has three stories. We were on the top and took the steps quite a bit. If this is a problem request ground floor. Pool- This area was nice. There is a swim up bar, and it did not smell bad. The pool at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya was much nicer however. Service was good and there were plenty of chairs. Beach- This area was by far the best we have ever seen on a trip. If you are a beach person you will love it. Clear blue water and white sand. It is also very big and wide with shade if you need it and plenty of chairs. When we went the water was ridiculously calm and warm, it was like being in a gigantic bathtub. Fish would swim right up to the shore, if you waded in you could see them before you got knee deep. There is free snorkeling and kayak rental which we took advantage of. There are also other free non motorized sports. Grounds/Service- Immaculate and well manicured. There is a really neat walkway between the Riu Yucatan and The Riu Palace Mexico that gives you a tropical view. The service also was great. Top notch, just ask and they will accommodate. The twice a day cleaning and turn down service was a nice touch. Food- We went to all of the restaurants, and buffets. The on the beach food was the least best. The beach restaurant had cook to order pasta, but could get redundant. The food was always hot. If not I am sure they would heat it up for you. The main buffet was also good with cook to order stations, fresh juice, and liquor/wine/beer. For the other restaurants men need pants and you need reservations that can be made in the morning supposedly at 830-1030, but just ask if you are leaving early on an excursion and they will accommodate you. There are only two seating times 6:30 and 8:45. I never had a problem with making reservations, Yamir was great. Remember that you can get more than one entr\u00e9e or appetizer or dessert if you desire. Krystal-gourmet-we liked the best. The shrimp ravioli is very good and the chocolate cake-lava cake was great. I had the sea bass which was cooked perfectly and the lamb. It was very good. Bodega is the Brazilian. They brought out about 8 different meats on skewers and fed you until you said stop. The steakhouse is the beach restaurant during the day and was good also. Steaks were cooked as ordered. The Japanese was just ok. I like sushi, and they don\u2019t really have sushi. They do have smoked salmon here and at the buffet which was great. The room service was not very good. If you were very drunk and very hungry it was edible. I will say the same for the \u201cfood\u201d at the sports bars at the different resorts. Entertainment- This was adequate. It is what you make of it. The night shows were okay. There was always something going on from during dinner time. The day activities were fun also. We got to shot rifles which was fun. Sister properties- Riu Tequilla is directly across the street. This one seemed to be the Riu Drunk European-because there were always fall down drunk Europeans there when we visited. It does have the disco, and sports bar but, they aren\u2019t really anything special. If you want night life go to Coco Bongo or 5th street. The Riu Yucatan is right next door. It has a far superior gym and some shops in the front worth checking out. There is a walkway that the people at the Riu Tequilla use to get to the beach between the Yucatan and the palace that is worth checking out. The Riu-playacar, this one is a little farther about 3 or so minutes walk. It had live music and a cool entertainment area, but the crowd here was much older- it could be nicknamed the Riu Hospice from what we saw. The Riu Palace Rivera Maya was very nice as well. It is past the Riu Playacar another 3 or so minutes. We got great service there, the sports bar was better than the Tequilla and pool was awesome. The Riu Lupita is small and a little further but there is a shuttle there that you can take back or into town which is a plus. It is past the Riu Yucatan. Excursions- First you need to get to town. You can get a taxi for as low as 4 USD. We did Tulum via collective but taxied back for 28 USD-make sure to haggle them. Tulum was nice and the collectivo was cheap but you get what you pay for. I would do this on your own vs. with a tour. The entrance price is 5 usd. Our favorite excursion was the Party Hopper. This is a must do. You ferry on your own to Cozumel. This is about a 45 minute boat ride on a nice sized vessel with live music. It costs 13 USD one way per person and leaves on the hour and the times vary. Once in Cozumel the party hop meets a location that will be told to you after you reserve it-check out the website. You go to four different bars on the non commercialized side of Cozumel and it is a blast. You get a free shot at each and this was the highlight of our trip. Misc- 5th street was worth checking out. There is a little shopping area closer with a starbucks right across the street that was worth checking out as well. If you are on the fence about this hotel, don\u2019t be. It is fantastic. Make sure to check out all the sister properties. The liquor was not watered down, and you can always get more. Tell them what you like and they will make you a drink. I would bring insulated cups. The weather in late Sept was great. An early morning shower, and a few clouds, but high 80's and sunny over 95% of the time.

This was our second time to PDC, last time in 2008 we stayed at the Royal Playa Del Carmen, which was wonderful, so that is what I have to compare the RPM to. We are in our late 20's, and this was a vacation to escape the demands of having a 1 year old--we needed relaxation and quiet! We arrived late (8pm) on Tuesday night. Check in was fast, and we were offered a welcome cocktail that was delicious. Our room was on the lower level below the lobby. I was initially disappointed in the room-it seemed dark and a little musty, but maybe that was because it was already dark out when we go there. It was spotless though-very clean-and stayed that way. The bed was a little firm, but we preferred it that way. The two beds pushed together actually make for a bed larger than a king which was nice! The maid staff did a great job cleaning and overall the room was pretty good. The beach was beautiful!! I usually prefer the pool to teh beach, but not here. It really was breathtaking. The water was blue and clear, and the beach area was actually pretty expansive. In this regard, RPM beat RPDC. We never had a problem finding a place to sit. The only thing lacking was bar service. There was a bar nearby you could go to for drinks (part of the hotel), but we were used to wait service and the RIU didn't offer this-would have been nice, but not a HUGE deal. Pool was nice, but not my favorite part. It could get kind of loud there mid day, but again, we didn't usually have trouble finding a spot. The entertainment was lacking, but we didn't mind all that much becuase we just wanted to relax and not do much anyways. Food: The buffet was decent for a large all inclusive hotel. Again, I felt the RDPC excelled in this area, so my standards were high. The breakfast was good-my husbands favorite part-as they had an omlette station and alot of variety. We enjoyed the a la carte restaurants for dinner. We tried Krystal (twice) and the pumpkin soup was so good as was the chocolate lava cake. We also tried the Japanese restaurant which was very good as well. Didn't get to the others. We did not do any excursions or even go to town, but we did walk the playacar area a little. There is a starbucks down the street and a little market, as well as many other RIU's to expore if you want. Next time we will likely stay somewhere on par more with RPDC, but for the price, this hotel was right on track.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Loius, MO", "Title": "\u201cGreat Vacation!\u201d", "Author": "co_native29", "ReviewID": "UR118895774", "Content": "My husband and I recently returned from a week stay at the Riu Palace. This was my second time to the area (previously stayed at Valentin Imperial) and my husbands first time. Overall it was a very nice hotel with very little to complain about. Rooms: The rooms are nice, spacious enough for 2 people with a little sitting area and a patio. As mentioned before, the beds are hard and not very comfortable. They are stocked with liquor, water and sodas. Food: I can't imagine anyone being unsatisfied with the food, there was something for everyone. Breakfast they had any type of breakfast you could imagine eating, even salads. Lunch was better in Don Julio with the other 2 lunch buffets just okay. Dinner we only ate at the buffets which were good with different theme nights. My one complaint is you had to make reservations to the sit down restaurants. I like the freedom of going when I want and this detered me from going. The one time I made a reservation I missed it. Pool/Beach: The beach was amazing, crystal clear water and very calm. We spend most of our time here. The pool was dissapointing. It was small and a big part of it was too shallow. Also when you go to the swim up bar there was this awful stench like someone threw up. The RIU chain seems very nice and I would most likely return here. The upside of this resort compared to the Valentin is the beach, much nicer.

Sorry for not entering this sooner-I thought I had written a review but found that I hadn't. This was our 7th stay at a RIU, but our first stay at this one. As always, my main gripe about the RIUs (and it's obviously not a huge one or we wouldn't have been to them 7 times!) is needing to make reservations for the al a carte evening dining. Other resorts of the same caliber as the RIUs manage not to need them, I just don't understand why the RIUs don't try it. Because of the need for reservations, we ate most of our meals, after trying each of the restaurants except the Brazilian, at the buffet. RIU's buffets, in my opinion, and especially this one, are second to none. The chocolate fountain with fruit for dipping was wonderful. The theme nights were always great. And, there was always a Mexican section to satisfy my love of Mexican food. The beach-as at every RIU we've been to except the one in Montego Bay-was great, with palm trees in abundance. The ocean water was lovely as well. However, on the days it was windy, it got a little rough. The swim-up pool area was fun. However, it was difficult to get out of as there were no stairs with a bar to hold on to. This would not be a problem for most, but I was only a few months post hip-replacement surgery. I informed the staff ahead of time about my surgery, and thery conveniently placed us on the first floor. The rom was beautiful and had no musty odor at all. Overall, it was a lovely vacation and I'm sure that we will be back.", "Date": "October 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cFantastic 6-Night Stay at RIU Palace Mexico\u201d", "Author": "jhchan02", "ReviewID": "UR118801206", "Content": "We stayed six nights at RIU Palace Mexico in PDC and returned 9/29/2011. I want to make this review as helpful as possible and don't want to write a novel. Things to keep in mind though: we traveled during off-peak hurricane season. There weren't crowds like there would probably be during spring break. Info & Tips: 1. Hotel Location - located in a gated community with many other hotels (including other RIUs where you can use their facilities) and residences, it felt safe walking around at all hours of the night. There was also a little \"mall\" near the hotel where you can get souvenirs and plan excursions. Also, for $6-7 taxi ride, you can venture down to Fifth Avenue and peruse the stores, bars, entertainment, etc. 2. Hotel Staff - very accommodating and happy to help. Our first day we had an issue with our safe. The front desk came immediately and fixed it. Also please tip the staff. I saw a lot of people order trays and trays of drinks and not tip. Though this is an all-inclusive, the staff really bend over backwards to get you everything you need 3. Beach - amazingly calm, clear, blue water. Never an issue looking for a beach chair. Again, this was off-peak season and this may be an issue for those traveling during the spring. Take advantage of the kayaks, catamarans, and snorkel gear (all included). We took some bread from lunch, grabbed our snorkel gear, and got to see and feed so many fish. They would just swarm around you...it was fantastic. 4. Pool - there were two pools (quiet and activity). I have to say the entertainment staff was really really bad. There really was no entertainment during the day except for bingo maybe. But that wasn't a big deal at all since we did our own thing and didn't remain seated by the pool for extended periods of time. It was just sad to see them try and fail. On two of the days we were there, they had parties on the beach with burgers, nachos, salad, etc. That was a nice attempt. As for chairs by the pool, we woke early the first morning to save seats, but realized it wasn't necessary (at least during our off-peak travel time). There was always something available and if there wasn't, you could always find something on the beach. 5. Food and Drinks - Breakfast was our favorite meal of the day. The fresh juices, the eggs made to order, etc. were great. I wouldn't say the food was all fantastic, but generally the food surpassed our expectations for an all-inclusive. We took advantage of the room service on one of the nights. It came within 15 minutes of ordering, which is unheard of in many other places. We didn't try all the specialty restaurants, but the two we did try (the steakhouse and Krystal (some fusion cuisine)) were pretty good. The service is a bit slow though, but nothing outrageous. DRINKS - it really depended on who made the drinks, but for the most part they were strong enough. They use cheap liquor though unless you make a specific request for Absolut, Bacardi, Smirnoff, etc. We tipped each time we ordered (whether poolside or at the bar) so service was always very prompt and we never had an empty glass. Also, we brought a thermos for our drinks because the cups they use by the pool are TINY and the drinks get warm very quickly. This was key and I credit other reviewers who gave us this idea. 6. Rooms - Generally spacious, but try to get a room facing the fountains. Also the BEDS...ugh the beds were terrible. They were the worst beds I've ever had to sleep on. You have to lay on this mattress cover type thing that's plastic and makes funny noises every move you make. As suggested by other reviewers, I emailed the hotel a week before arrival for a mattress topper and a room facing the fountains. Neither request was taken into consideration. Further, this hotel uses actual keys for your room, not keycards. And to top that off, your actual key has your room number etched into it. For worst case scenario purposes, I may as well have drawn a map to my room for a potential thief. This is the first hotel I've ever stayed in that still uses actual keys. Really? Overall we had a fantastic stay at RIU Palace Mexico. The upkeep to the hotel was great. The grounds were beautiful. The staff was fantastic. We would definitely return. On our visits to the surrounding RIUs in the gated community (with the exception of RIU Palace Riviera Maya since we didn't visit it), we definitely felt like our hotel was well superior to the others. The others felt a bit more crowded, a bit more festive, but I liked our hotel with fewer people and nicer grounds. I recommend this hotel and would definitely return. And for those who are hesitant about traveling during hurricane season, it's really a crapshoot. I was nervous and bought travel insurance. It only rained on two of the mornings we were there. After breakfast, it had cleared up and the rest of the days were sunny.", "Date": "September 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zelienople, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cExcelente!!!\u201d", "Author": "Shellshock18", "ReviewID": "UR118796116", "Content": "LOVED this place!!!

We had yet another wonderful visit. Room was not ready upon arrival but we arrived at noon and expected this. One of the staff from the front desk came and let us know that it was ready. I had requested at least 2nd or 3rd floor and this was honored and we had the 2 full beds pulled together with the pad and it was just great. You could not tell it was 2 beds with this. I know everyone says the bed it hard but it was just right for us. Had left note the first day for extra water and Pepsi light and from then on had all we needed. Our housekeeping staff was wonderful. It was cleaned close to the first thing every morning and we had towel art and flowers arranged. Evening turn down service was also good. Always had plenty of towels and face clothes. Housekeeping staff do not get enough praise for the work they do. They are excellent at meeting your needs and getting their work done. Only issue we noted one day was that the pool around the pool bar area did not seem as clean as the other pool. May have been because of more people being in that area. Music at night was great. Do enjoy this part of the resort. We did not do any of the a la cartes but felt we had plenty to eat at the buffet each day and lot of variety. Would not have done this different. did not seem that people were having any problems making reservations. Too many wonderful staff to name. We spent most of the time at the lobby and were taken very good care of by them. Elena, Hiram, Emmel just to name a few. I am not sure I have spelled the names correct. also want to thank Jaquin, one of the managers in the buffet area that we spoke with frequently. Very nice young man. Congrats on your upcoming wedding. Front desk staff were very helpful when we had any questions. Never had any issues at all during our visit.

Also like the way they have done the doors so there is not the loud slam when people close their doors. We felt welcome from the moment that we arrived until we left.

We started out with 8 days at the Riu Tequila which we thought was just fantastic with a value that could not be beat. However, when we realized we could have 3 more days in paradise we decided to see how life was with a \"gold\" bracelet...Thanks to TA - we had met up with another family with teens earlier in the week who had previously stayed at the Tequila who gently informed us that they had no regrets making the \"upgrade\". The only thing that was equal between both hotels was the extraordinary staff and service which is unparalleled anywhere I have traveld in the world. So with packed bags at 9 am - we simply crossed the street and checked in. We did not expect to have a room right away and to our surprise 1 of our 2 rooms was ready. We made our reservations for Krystal and hit the beach. As it is really the same beach as the other Rius - there was no big difference there. However, as soon as we hit the pool we starting seeing a difference. There were no rowdy sports at the pool as at the Tequila. Thought my guys who fully partook in games would be missing that fun. Instead, there was a warm welcome from other TA family as well as all the other kids at the pool. While there were much fewer kids (and people in general it seemed), it was easier to interact with those who were there. Both my boys (14 & 9) made a bunch of friends that they saw throughout the 3 days. As the Tequila is so spread out with so many kids - my guys did not regroup with the same kids ever. RPM felt more like a country club where everyone knew everyone than an AI. I know that the RPM is quite big - but it never felt crowded like the Tequila or the Yucatan. The only thing missing was the Sportsbar which is fun in the evening for pool for boys and worth visiting. We did not like the Sportsbar at RPMR - very boring when we went. We all noted a difference between drinks (kids & adults) between the Tequila and RPM. They had much better choices at RPM which were more fruit based. The kids and I all enjoyed the fruit punch. And later in the day the Coco Rossa was fabulous. You could have Cava morning, noon and night if you wanted. I'll get to the wine at dinner later. There was a huge difference between the accommodations that we noted right away. While we had no view outside of palm trees - we thoroughly preferred the RPM. Standard rooms felt like suites. Balconies are huge! Bathrooms were large. And the woodwork was beautifully done in the room. Towels were white (as opposed to brown). And it felt like the room was constantly being spruced up. Turn down service is something I could get used to. The kids enjoyed room service for breakfast while us parents indulged in mimosas and the extensive breakfast buffet. Loved every minute of dining out on the patio in the morning. Best breakfast in the world - IMHO! As everything seem smaller and more manageable at the RPM - as a family we split up for lunch. The boys (Dad included) preferred lunch at the beach: fiesta or beach restaurant. My daughter & I preferred to dine on linen with a glass of wine at lunch. Loved that we could all do what we wanted allowing special time for everyone. The biggest surprise of all was that the kids (as well as the adults as well as the Maitre D) loved the \"gourmet\" a la carte restaurant Krystal so much we did it 2 nights in a row. I might also add everyone had clean plates (both nights). The quality of the food and service literally blew us away. Felt like we were dining in a top restaurant in NYC. Fantastic. At our first dinner, a German man was celebrating his birthday and it was so much fun when literally the whole room joined in singing. I think the overwhelming good will of everyone there inspired the man to then serve his cake to every table with an introduction and thanks for sharing with him such a happy day. I felt that this really reflected the ambiance at the RPM. While it may be a big international AI - it feels more like a very intimate club where everyone takes time to relax, indulge in the good things in life, enjoy each other and be open to meeting new people (staff & guests). It is such a beautiful setting which inspires such a wonderful experience on so many levels. Obviously, we are planning on returning.

We tipped a man who brings drinks on the beach (only 20 pesos) and we never had an empty glass he even brought down some Absolute Vodka to top up my cocktails! *German in the buffet resteraunt truly made every tea time meal amazing, we tipped him and from then on he had a table with flowers and champagne flutes waiting for us! *Trips, we did Chichen Itza and Coba although they seem similar in the thompson trip guide, if you enjoy history then its well worth doing them both!

With the service being much slower at the ala cartes and the food to our family was not better then the buffet, after our 2nd ala carte the gourmet, we were done with the time constraints and just enjoyed the buffet for the rest of the time. If you do book them, I recommend Sunday to Tuesday as the buffet quality seemed less on these days. To us the worst night at the buffet was the Italian, it seemed about the only difference was a lasagna. Buffet a few notable foods for us were the carpaccio, beef wellington, sushi, onion soup with croutons, chocolate covered strawberries, very large cold crab claws one night only, unpeeled cold shrimp was good, they did have it one night peeled and cooked. I like red wines and was fortunate enough to have Giovanny at the buffet let me taste the selections, I enjoyed the diavlolo cab and there was a shiraz but not sure if it was diavolo. The wines weren't what I would drink here at home but they were o.k. Room Service was O.K. You could order a light breakfast if you put it out the night before, finally found the sheet to order it on in the drawer. We had to catch an early shuttle but room service breakfast and main buffet were not available until 7 a.m. Of course all the other items were available 24 hours. We ended up walking across the street to the Riu Tequila sports bar as it has sandwiches and fruit to go. Drinks were good of course the lobby had the best. I enjoyed the Ernest Hemingway, Mango Margarita, Espresso Martini just to mention a few. It seemed when we first arrived it was all top shelf toward the end I found they were putting cheap coffee liquor in my white Russians, I thought we just had a bad bartender but when I saw him make it I noticed he was not using Kahlua for the most part they did. I found that strange again it started on Sunday. Beach was beautiful, water was clear however, due to a slight incline I found it hard to walk down the beach with just my feet in the water. It was like one leg was shorter then the other. It was swimable and nice though. Pool was pretty, loved the flowers on the bottom. I didn't like the fact that they only had ladders to get into and out of the pool with. It would have been hard for and elderly person and sometimes we take my mom-in-law. Animation team was O.K. not as wild as the Yucatan next door but we enjoyed it being a bit quieter and knew what to expect from previous reviews. We weren't there to party so it worked for us. Special things. They had a beach party twice, it was dancing on the beach and decorations around noon. One day they had Paella another day it was just burgers and hot dogs. They also had special drinks near the beach bar, coconuts with or without alcohol and fresh blended fruit one day which is my favorite. In the plaza they had some flaming shots and I believe special Mexican coffees one night but my favorite again were the fresh fruit daiquiri's they had kiwi, peach, strawberry, mango etc. Rooms were O.K. We looked out to trees (not palm trees), it was nice to have a private balcony though. We had 2123 and 2122 it was quiet on the top floor and exited near the pool. Email request received pretty prompt response. I had inquired about what types of shoes were required for men and the reply was any. I had send an email mentioning we were return visitors having been to the Riu Tequila previously but got nothing special. My request for a specific area they were unable to fill. I had also requested one room be a king bed the other two separate beds with mattress pads, none of that was done. We enjoyed the resort too much to even bother trying to rectify these small issues. Palace Mexico to Palace Riviera Maya, we walked down a few times to enjoy the infinity pool but I hated the headless statue as you entered from the pool into the lobby!!! Having a sports bar there was a plus. I'm sure if the price were the same I would have a tough time choosing between the two. I also much preferred the larger fountains at the Palace Mexico.

Located about an hour from Cancun Airport, the RIU Palace Mexico is one lovely place to stay at. The hotel entrance looks like the front of a palace some where in Europe. As you enter the resorts lobby you are entranced by the beauty of the marble, flowers and fixtures. The staff at the front desk was on top of their game. We were wisked to our suite (which the front desk staff upgraded up to) that over looked beautiful gardens and fountains on the center area of the resort in under 5 minutes. The suite was very attractive, clean and up to date. There was a bedroom, sitting area and a large outdoor balcony. The bathroom was done in marble with a separate toilet area. For our stay the rooms air conditioner was great. We found the room to be very quite during the day and night. The resort area has three swimming pools, one with a swim up bar. Around the pool area there is volleyball, fitness in the pool, bingo games and rifle target shooting. The beach area was spectacular. The sand a clean light beige with several hundred sunning chairs located either in the sun or within the hundreds of palm trees for shading. Watch out for the coconuts falling from the trees.The ocean in this area is a clear, clean and a beautiful light blue. Scuba divers love the area for coral and fish viewing. There is available on the beach a massage area. The ocean was smooth with hardly a wave. During the day food is served and drinks offered on a continued bases. Did I fail to mention that the resort is all inclusive? All the food and drink one could desire 24 hours a day. The RIU has 7 restaurants to dine in. Your choice. Steak, lobsters, shrimps etc. Each night the buffet features different region of food, Italian, Mexican and European. We found the food to rate an 8 out of 10 for dinner. Breakfast is all you could ask for. In your room is a minibar loaded with drinks. All part of the package. Each night there is a show put on, mostly dancing and some singing. I rated these shows at a 7. Nothing like the one's you see on cruise ships. The weather for all seven days was sun, sun and more sun. A wonderful tan was gotten by all of us. The hotel is a 5 minute, $7 dollar taxi ride to town. I was very surprised how nice their shopping area was. Very clean, modern and friendly locals. Its a must to visit the area known as \"5th Avenue\" in the evening. To end I found the entire staff to be attentive, helpful and as asset to the resort. Would we return?

The hotel ground are immaculately maintained. The service staff are impressively proactive and comparatively more professional than the staff at the Maya Palace down the road. This was a pleasant surprise. The pool is functional and ha a friendly feel. The service seems faster in the Palace Mexico. I put this down to staff to guest ratios. The pool service at the Riu Mexico is very friendly. The beach is just behind the pool area. It is beautiful! Especially from 8-11 when it is not as hot. I used some of the free watersports facilities and the motorised stuff. All very safe and professional. The food is spot on. We tried all the restaurants on offer and enjoyed them all for different reasons. Service with meals is superb. Your wine glass is never allowed to be empty. The lobby bar supplies you with the best drinks in my opinion. Overall, great hotel, nice staff and cracker location. It's nice to be able to utilise all facilities nearby. It mixes it up abit.

There were 4 of us: My parents, my partner and myself. We all thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. The food and the restaurants were fantastic except for the Japanese and La Bodega. Even in these restaurants, the service was amazing and high quality ingredients were used; they just weren't to our taste. The buffet restaurant was the best all-inclusive restaurant I have eaten at (a really huge choice, hot and fresh) and the Steakhouse (El Patio) and Krystal were also really lovely. Booking was never, ever a problem for us. Room service is limited but it is included in the price and they will deliver it 24 hours a day. The drinks were also really good. Branded spirits, proper glasses (all inclusive hotels that I have stayed before have insisted on plastics anywhere other than in the restaurant), lovely cocktails and brilliant service. The lobby bar was particularly good - you were served extremely quickly and it was air conditioned. Drinks in rooms were also great - 4 spirit optics and a full fridge every day. You can also use all the bars in the other Riu hotels in the resort (there are 5 Riu hotels here altogether). The hotel itself was spotlessly clean and extremely well maintained even if the sunbeds on the beach could have been smartened up a bit. The beach was great and always enough beds to go around. There were a lot of cigarette ends but it's not the hotel that I blame for that although perhaps they could invest in some ashtrays. Giovany, who cleaned both of our suites, made sure that we always returned to immaculate rooms. Like many Caribbean hotels, there can be a damp smell but this was not overpowering. Every single member of staff, from the door men, the maids, waiters, bar staff, chefs reception staff and supervisors made you feel welcome and relaxed. Raul, Saul, Miguel, Hiram, Jorge and Paty were fantastic. It was wonderful! Please ignore bad reviews - my family have travelled a lot and we will all complain if something is not right.

Arrival: Arrived at the RPM exhausted following a 10 hour (advertised as 8 hour) Thomas Cook (TC) charter flight from Manchester, which at best can only be described as 'no frills'. The main meal was served just 2 hours into the flight and only a light snack of a scone later on. The main movie did not work and one of the toilets was broken, resulting in long queues. You also have to pay for all additional drinks and food - I have never before experienced this on a long-haul flight. This all made for a very long and tedious journey and we were relieved to finally arrive in Cancun. Exiting the airport was slow through customs, but straightforward, and our TC rep was waiting for us just outside the airport doors. Transfer by coach was fine and took about 1.5 hours, however, our coach was only half full so this could potentially take a lot longer and you can do it much faster in a taxi for only around US $50, which we will definitely consider for future trips. Playacar is a gated community of hotels and condominiums just outside of Playa del Carmen. Although it felt a bit like we were staying in Disney World, it is beautiful and meticulously well-kept and significantly quieter and pleasanter all-round than Cancun's glitzy hotel zone. Upon arrival in Playacar, we were greeted at the RPM by warm and friendly reception staff. The gorgeous lobby, in the trademark Riu Palace style, is modern but invokes an old colonial feel. After a short check-in procedure, we were handed some refreshing fruit cocktails and were given detailed information about the hotel and its facilities before a porter took our bags to our room. Your room key is on a string to hang round your neck, which is handier then you'd think given how much you are in and out of the pool, beach etc. - much less difficult to lose than room cards. We met the TC rep on the 2nd day of the trip, who was helpful and informative about the various activities and excursions on offer. The excursion prices quoted were very high e.g. the rep quoted a price for a whale sharks excursion which was US $75 per person more then we eventually paid through another operator and a staggering US $100 more pp than someone else on the same trip with us paid when booked through another company again. You all end up on the same trip anyway, so be sure to shop around. Room: The room was great! We had emailed the hotel in advance to inform them we were celebrating our anniversary and they had upgraded us to a junior suite with a large balcony on the 2nd floor overlooking the gorgeous courtyard with its fountains and 'chic' outdoor drinks area where people gather for the evening's entertainment. Without the upgrade, you can potentially end up facing the hotel next door! The staff had put balloons in the room and later added a gift and a note congratulating us, which was very thoughtful. We had a large balcony with sun-loungers and high walls for privacy and inside there was a two-seater sofa, coffee table and flatscreen TV (with a good range of Spanish and English language channels including ESPN and MTV) in a separate seating area. The bed was in fact two double beds pushed together giving the appearance of being absolutely huge. The bedding comprised light sheets, but there were blankets and spare pillows in the cupboard if needed. Fresh bedding was provided daily and there was always a fun 'twist' to the way the bed had been made, sometimes with the addition of flowers and rose petals. The air conditioning was adequately powerful, but not freezing. The bathroom was a good size with a separate room for the toilet, a large sink area for toiletries, a bath and shower and small hairdryer. The mini-bar was restocked daily and additional water can be ordered through the 24 hour room service. The lobby bar is also open till 7am so you are pretty much always able to get a drink if you want one from somewhere in the hotel. There is an iron and ironing board in the room, as well as an easy to use safe and filter coffee machine. Ice is available from machines at the end of the hallways on the 1st and ground floors and there is an ice bucket to fill below the optics dispensing branded vodka, tequila, brandy and rum, which are checked daily and restocked as required. The curtains are thick enough to adequately block out the light. The room was kept spotlessly clean by the staff who were always friendly, courteous and quick with their work. They also left new towel art every couple of days, which was all really amazing (we loved it so much we went to the lessons to learn how to make it). They also tidied up our toiletries in the bathroom, which we always appreciated, and would happily wait if you were not yet out of your room when they came to clean. We were really happy with our room and the only thing that could have improved it would be having wireless internet access, as this is currently only available in the lobby and (intermittently depending on traffic) the courtyard area, although it is free at least. Pool: The pool area was big and relatively quiet during the day (lovely) so there were plenty of sun-loungers nicely spaced apart. The pool itself could probably do with an upgrade soon, but was cleaned daily and a nice warm temperature. There was a volleyball net area, a pool bar, some in-pool seating at the sides near the bar and a separate pool away from the bar. There was also a toddler's pool near the children's club area. Unfortunately, this appeared to be seldom used and the majority of the children were near the pool bar area. The splashing and ball throwing was slightly annoying at times, but we can't blame the kids whose parents were clearly not bothered, at the pool bar, or otherwise elsewhere. At no time was the pool overrun with kids, however, I wondered if using the other lesser-used pool as a dedicated children's pool might be a good idea to keep the pool bar area splash-free. The pool bar itself was excellent and served all the drinks and cocktails you can get elsewhere in the hotel. We highly enjoyed the Mojitos and Miami Vice cocktails. There were unfortunately no bar snacks (other than peanuts) which would have been a nice addition. There is a nacho dispenser near the toilets in the pool bar area, but these did not look hugely appetising (the chips are nice, the cheese is not, being artificial 'squeezy cheese'). There is food available throughout the rest of the hotel on a 24 hour basis though, so you will not go hungry (see food section below). Beach: The beach area is huge so although it is busy, it is really pleasant in the 'garden area' and there is often a nice breeze which helps with the heat of the day. Sun-loungers and hammocks rest between the palm trees which provide great shade and there were occasional beach BBQs and dance parties to keep you entertained. There is a massage hut, a beach volleyball court and a water-sports hut where you are borrow snorkels, canoes, small sail boats and boogie boards for up to one hour at a time. They also offer jet skiing, diving, parasailing etc. for an additional price. If you are planning to do any snorkelling in the wider Yucatan area, we recommend bringing your own gear to save on equipment hire at cenotes and other snorkelling sites. The sea in front of the hotel was very clean and a beautiful turquoise colour, but was unfortunately highly congested with motor sports traffic (seemingly largely from the hotel next door) including jet skis, parasailing boats and speed boats which made it very noisy and choppy. There was also a frequent stench of diesel fuel - not a very pleasant atmosphere for relaxing in the sea unfortunately. We did enjoy some early morning dips before it got too busy and some moonlit strolls and if you walk along the beach up past Playa del Carmen there are some nicer, quieter spots. You are free to walk the entire length of the beach under Mexican law and there is lots of security patrolling the various beaches in front of hotels so it is all very safe at night in the strip leading up to Playa del Carmen. Recreation & Entertainment: The Animation team were excellent. In particular, Omar was an absolute star and made sure we had a fun-filled stay. Dianne, Carlos and Freddie were also great fun and all very professional. The team organise activities during the day including towel art lessons, spanish lessons, salsa lessons, volleyball, aqua aerobics, beach BBQs and table tennis competitions. There is also a Kid's club during the day which appeared to be very well attended. For the adults, the Animation team can also escort you on nights out to local clubs, including Coco Bongo and the Pink Elephant, at no extra cost, and will ensure that you get a good spot and great service in the club. The evening entertainment at the hotel is also really good. There are nightly shows for the children (Aladdin was great), followed by professional dance shows which are all on the stage adjacent to the courtyard. The shows have various themes on a 2-week rotation (our favourites were Movie Night, Grease and Michael Jackson). In between shows, there are live bands on the courtyard bandstand. There are also themed games nights, such as the casino and Mexican games night. There are musicians in the bar and lobby areas and a whole host of random extras like fashion shows around the pool and 'pop up' markets on different nights of the week - you don't even have to leave the hotel to do your souvenir shopping (although you will pay a higher price). Other recreational activities on offer include a tennis court (it was way too hot to play when we went), a spa facility comprising a small but adequate gym (2 treadmills, 2 bikes, 2 cross trainers and a step machine, free weights, incline bench, squat bar and cable machine for lat pulldowns etc.), massage and spa treatments, a sauna and hot and cold jacuzzi. There is also another jacuzzi tucked away in the corner of the courtyard gardens near the pool. Like the pool, the jacuzzis have seen better days, but are still nice. The spa looks lovely and smelled gorgeous. We didn't have any treatments but these seemed to be standard at around US $120 for their top massage treatment.\u00a0 In short, you will not be bored at this hotel...! Food: There is an abundance of food on offer including the main buffet restaurant and 4 \u00e0 la carte restaurants. Breakfast was our favourite meal of the day. Margherita's freshly made omelettes are the stuff of legends and she was an absolute delight each morning. As testimony to this, there was always an orderly queue patiently waiting for one of her quickly prepared omelettes with fillings of your choice. Hot and cold food is served buffet-style including, eggs, meats, breads, salads, muffins, fruit, cereals etc etc. Lunch was buffet-style again with all of the above plus pizza, burgers, grilled meats, pastas etc and the buffet dinner was the same again with additional themed meats, desserts and other dishes. The quality of the food was very good-to-excellent the majority of the time and there was a wide variety to choose from everyday. We particularly enjoyed the extensive salad bar and the guacamole, salsa and cerviche are to die for. Wine, beers and soft drinks are served across all meals. Between us, our group tried all of the \u00e0 la carte restaurants. You book these on the day, in the morning from 8.30am near the courtyard and stage area, but get there early as most of the slots have gone by 9am. Our favourite restaurant was Krystal, (which has a fusion menu), because of the great service, food and atmosphere, but also largely because the steak house and Rodizio restaurants were not air conditioned which made for a very sweaty dining experience. Both the Miyagi (Japanese) and Krystal restaurants were small, air-conditioned and offered a nice change from the buffet dining. Room Service was really handy after a night out and generally very quick at all times of the day, but the limited menu choice was a bit disappointing. Please add French fries to the menu - easy to make and perfect post-clubbing food! The coffee was pretty terrible everywhere so bring your own cafeti\u00e8re, instant sachets and a kettle, or filters and coffee to use in the machine in the room if you are an addict. The espressos are ok and Starbucks is not far otherwise! The bars were plentiful, efficient and served a great selection of drinks and cocktails. You can get take-out espressos in disposable cups at the main lobby bar. At all bars and meals you can request specific wines I'd you find one you like (we loved the White Zinfandel ros\u00e9 and the Chilean Cabernet red). Service: The service we received was truly outstanding and made this trip really stand out from anywhere else we have stayed. Our group has travelled extensively throughout the world and we all agreed that we have never before experienced a more friendly, helpful and professional service anywhere else in the world. Nothing was too much to ask and you felt pampered and cared-for every step of the way. Service was always with a smile and staff were attentive, pleasant and chatty, but not imposing.The etiquette in the restaurant and hotel generally was outstanding, but without any uncomfortable pretence. It was all of the little touches that really stood out, for example, staff come round in the evenings to check if you need fresh towels, they provide a poolside drinks service (remembering your round each time) and, most memorably, always greet you with a cheery and sincere \"hola!\". From the maids and porters, to the chefs, waiters and the front of house workers, the staff at this hotel work tirelessly to ensure that you have an amazing holiday and I have never before experienced a more friendly and professional service anywhere in the world. The staff in our hotel were also head and shoulders above those we encountered in other Rius and should be highly commended for their amazing work. Wildlife: There is some interesting wildlife at the hotel including sereque (best seen at around 6-7am or 6-7pm), some interesting looking lizards and pelicans flying by the beach. There are also a vast number of black birds with long beaks which I can only presume are the Mexican equivalent to pigeons in the UK. They are quite noisy and make some interesting calls, but they were quite entertaining and don't harass you or leave a mess (other than occasional sugar packets scattered about the bushes which they pinch from the outdoor breakfast tables). You can also see sereque and howler monkeys at the Riu Yucatan next door. Mosquitos and red ants are everywhere in this part of Mexico. I was savaged on the first night here and had to spend days treating painful and itchy bites. The mosquito repellant wrist bands do nothing. Buy the hardcore Deet products and possibly a plug for your bedroom at night. You will definitely need insect spray if you do any excursions to the jungle as you will be bitten to pieces. There is not much to see snorkelling off the beach and you can't go out very far due to the motor sports traffic. You might see the occasional fish go past and small crabs scuttling past further down the beach at nighttime. Location: The hotel is about 2.5km from the security barrier that leads out to Playa del Carmen. This is quite a hot walk, either on the road through Playacar, or on the beach, but taxis are cheap and you can also rent bikes from the Riu Tequila (across the road from the RPM). Playacar, although very artificial, is a beautiful place and a good base to explore the region from. Excursions can be pricy, so we found it more economical to rent a car and drive ourselves to the various towns and archaeological sites at our own leisure. You can park securely at the hotel for free and can also park at other Rius. Playa del Carmen was generally a lot more touristy and ranged from areas full of rowdy bars and street hawkers to quieter areas with nice caf\u00e9s and boutique hotels. Much of the town beyond Avenue Constituyentes is where the locals live and seemed to be quite poor. This part of town is generally not for tourists, although the beaches up here are supposedly much quieter and nicer so worth a drive up if you have a car. The general Yucatan area all appeared to be very safe and we happily roamed about on foot, bike and car during our stay. Shopping: The hotel has a small shop selling sundries like batteries, disposable cameras, cigarettes, chocolate etc. and assorted beach wear, but is generally more expensive than shops outside of the hotel. Playacar has a small shopping precinct just across the road from the RP with a Starbucks, Avis car hire (incidentally the cheapest and best deal we found in and around Playa del Carmen), a drugstore/corner-shop and various souvenir shops. There is also a stand here for booking excursions and it is definitely worth shopping around and haggling for a better price for these because, as aforementioned, there can be up to US $100 difference in prices for the same experience when booked through different operators. There is an Oxo express supermarket in the Riu Yucatan next door to the RP and another Oxo further up the road from here and a pharmacy in the RP Riviera Maya. We found that the best place to buy souvenirs was in the Chichen Itza hacienda. The sheer number of sellers here serves to drive down prices, particularly late in the day when there are real bargains to be had (this is also the best time to visit if you can, as it is quieter and cooler). The items on sale here seemed to also be of better quality than those we found in town. Other Rius: The golden wrist bands of the RP are your golden ticket to go to any other Riu hotel for breakfast, lunch, drinks and access to the pool and beach facilities... or just for a nosey like us! We visited the Riu Yucatan, Riu Tequila and RP Riviera Maya in Playacar and the RP Las Americas in Cancun. These visits confirmed our view that we had chosen the best hotel in the Riu chain in this area and we were always pleased to 'come home' each time we visited another Riu. The RP Riviera Maya had a newer and nicer pool area and slightly more lively atmosphere in the pool, but a smaller and much less grand courtyard; the hotels are otherwise identical but the RP Riviera Maya was slightly more expensive when we booked. The Yucatan and Tequila were clearly lower classed hotels within the chain and definitely had a less luxurious feel, although they are possibly livelier if you are after that sort of vacation. The disco in the Tequila, La Pi\u00f1ata, serves all the Riu hotels in Playacar, but was small and disappointing. Save your time and energy for Coco Bongo instead. There is also a sports bar at the Tequila but as most of the football is on the ESPN in the RPMs rooms anyway, again I wouldn't waste your time visiting. Departure: Check out is at (a very respectable) 12pm and was very quick and straightforward. We had to wait around in the lobby for a couple of hours for out transfer so we had lunch and then drinks at the lobby bar while we waited. You can get small bottles of water from reception and there are toilets and showers in the lobby which you can use. The doorman will look after your luggage so you can go off and use the pool etc. while you wait. TC transfer to Cancun was fine as were the airport security procedures. The VIP lounge is not worth a visit \u2013 no food other than bar snacks and no vegetarian food. We went to Bubba Gump's restaurant instead where you can use free wifi. The flight back was shorter (9 hours) but equally as dreadful as the flight out. Two passengers in the seats in front of me started an argument over reclining seats (thankfully diffused by the stewardess before it really kicked off), it was noisy, smelly and the food dreadful. I slept as much as possible and was relieved to get home! I will definitely look into travelling with a more reputable airline in future. Flights aside, we all had a fantastic time at the RPM and would definitely recommend it for a luxury holiday in a fabulous location, with the best service you will ever experience. Recommended for: We would especially recommend the RP Mexico for couples, families, older travellers and anyone looking for a lovely, chilled, and hassle-free holiday. It is probably not a good venue for a party crowd (stag, hen dos etc.) as the hotel tends to go quiet after the evening entertainment finishes around midnight - try the Yucatan or the Tequila instead!", "Date": "August 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing, great food and even better service\u201d", "Author": "lw12", "ReviewID": "UR117088642", "Content": "I just returned from a nine day trip.

They will bring you your drinks at the shows, at the beach, by the pool and in the lobby. Every night there was live music and a good show. If you wanted more excitement all you have to do is cross the street and go to the disco. Or if you want to catch up on a ball game. The Riu complex has two sports bars, one at Riu Tequilla and one at Riu Palace Playcar. The one great thing about staying at a palace is that all the hotels are included except for the dinner. The food was amazing. The buffets were great and a large variety. We were stuffed full at every meal. Reservations were not hard to come by. You do have to make sure you get to the reservationalist in the theater area sometime in the 8AM hour. Only small tidbit I would offer American travellers. Come prepared with some smaller bills or have some US dollars converted to pesos. You can use US at the gift shop and the shops accross the street, but they only give you change in US. The hotel front desk will not convert US dollars or give change for US dollars.", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Worth, Texas", "Title": "\u201cAmazing!

The hotel handled all of the wedding planning, I made every decision through emails and then a final meeting upon our arrival to finalize the plans we had made. All of my friends and family were jealous of how carefree and relaxed I was throughout the planning! There are a few things to let future travellers know: 1. RIU hotels does not accept USD, only pesos or Visa and MC. 2. The hallways to the rooms are mostly open to the environment, don't expect cool hallways. However, the rooms are kept cool unless you have the front door or patio/balcony doors open. My A/C went out in my room (on my wedding day) and was fixed within one hour of calling the front desk, they were fabulous! 3. Men must take pants in order to have dinner at any of the restaurants, even the buffet. Be prepared! My husband and I are already planning a return trip back!

I have stayed at a number of 5 star resorts as well as numerous all-inclusive resorts. This is the best all-inclusive I have been to. This was a family vacation (2 adults and 2 children, ages 9 and 15). We all loved this place! It was a great perk to be able to go to all of the other Riu resorts and use their amenities as well. There are 4 other Riu resorts within very easy walking distance (3 of them are within a 2 minute walk; the other is less than 10 minutes). Having visited all of the Riu's, I was glad we had chosen the Riu Palace Mexico, as I really thought it was the nicest one all around. The Riu Palace Playacar would have been a close second (they are almost identically built). Within walking distance is Playacar Plaza (less than a 5 minute walk). Loved this place because it has a Starbucks (which became a daily hotspot for us since we didn't care too much for the coffee at the resort). The Plaza also has a number of tourist shops and places where you can buy tickets for various excursions (I recommend you buy them at the Plaza rather than in the hotel lobby. We compared prices and it was a good bit cheaper at the Plaza). We purchased tickets for Delphinus (swimming with the dolphins), which I HIGHLY recommend. Also within walking distance of the hotel is downtown Playa del Carmen and 5th Avenue shopping. It takes 30 minutes to walk there and it was a very safe and beautiful walk. We even saw a number of young women out walking by themselves in the evening. We walked to 5th Avenue but then took a cab back to the resort afterwards since we were all a bit tired (it was $7 US for the cab ride back). This hotel is spotlessly clean...and I mean every part of it. They have an army of people who seem to be working around the clock to keep everything in perfect condition. The grounds are impeccable. The room was very nice (and again, VERY clean). Probably one of my only complaints is that the beds, the linens, and the pillows aren't very comfortable. The food really sets this place apart from the others. Even the buffet was incredible. And unlike many of the other resorts that have open air buffets, this one is situated inside a beautiful dining facility. The wait staff was fantastic. We sat in German's section every night (I highly recommend you find his section--he's wonderful!). We had no problem getting reservations for any of the specialty restaurants. We forgot to make a reservation one day and were able to walk up at the time of dinner and still be seated. They have a smoothie bar as part of the breakfast buffet every day. We all got hooked on the banana smoothies! The evening entertainment was mediocre. We would generally go for the first 30 minutes or so and then leave. Note that there is no teens club and the children's center really seemed to be geared towards much younger kids (my 9 year old didn't go there at all). The pool is nice, if a little plain. The pools at some of the other Riu resorts were a bit larger and seemed to have more activities (basetball hoops, soccer nets, larger volleyball nets, etc.). Unfortunately the pool water was so warm most days that we couldn't stand to get in it (but I think this would likely be the case at all the resorts given the hot, hot temps every day). We never had any issue finding chairs by the pool, even when we'd get there late morning. You never had to go in search of a drink. There was always a wait staff person close by checking to see if you wanted anything. The resort is situated on what I believe (and what some of the locals confirmed) to be the best beach in the area. It is has very soft sand and crystal clear blue water. There are a lot of water sports available right in front of the resort. We did parasailing. Shop around a bit for prices. The first place quoted $60 per person. By asking around, we were able to find it for $45 per person. I also have to share that we mistakenly left our in-room safe wide open one day when we left the room. We figure we had a couple thousand dollars worth of items in the safe (4 cell phones, an iPod, an iPad, jewelry, money, passports, etc.). On our bed, we received a notice that the resort security had been notified by the maid that the safe was open. Security locked the safe for us and sat down with us when we returned to go over all of the contents of the safe. Not one thing was missing. I give the resort top marks for their safety/security practices. I did a lot of \"homework\" before picking this resort. If you're doing the same, trust me, look no further. You won't be disappointed with this resort. It is absolutely top notch.", "Date": "August 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Springfield, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Resort, Great Service!\u201d", "Author": "klhrn", "ReviewID": "UR116680211", "Content": "This resort exceeded our expectations. I read the mixed reviews on trip advisor, after having been there ourselves I can say it was the right choice. The resort was very clean, the grounds were immaculate! The beach was wide and beautiful with lots of chairs, we never had any difficulty getting one any time of the day. There were lots of mature palm trees on the beach so there was plenty of shade if you wanted it. The beach is sandy all the way in the water which gives the ocean that beautiful blue color. The water was clear. We were a little leery of traveling to Mexico, I had concerns about the people, food, water, safety etc..but decided to try an all inclusive resort. Wow were we surprised, the service was excellent, the people that worked at the resort were all very friendly and went out of their way to help you. Most were bilingual, some spoke 3 languages. Some of the reviews spoke of poor food, we were amazed at the selection and choices we had. We only ate at the buffets, but each night had a different theme, Italian, seafood, Asian, Mexician etc. We never had a problem finding something delicious to eat. There were activities throughout the day at the resort, you could be as active as you wanted or just chill & relax, which is what we did. The rooms were large with a sitting area & fridge, which was restocked each morning. We had plenty of drinks and bottled water. If you needed anything all you had to do was ask. The only complaint I had was the beds were a little hard. Everything was very well maintained, I did not see any bugs or critters, but we were on the 3rd floor, you have to remember the halls are open to the outside, no windows or glass so a critter can easily make it's way into the hall. The rooms are air conditioned, which felt good after a day at the beach. Other reviewers talked about how hard the employees worked and boy are they right. They did not expect tips but were very grateful for any that came their way. The drinks are plentiful, we brought our own insulated mugs and they were happy to fill them with whatever we requested and we took these to the beach. Another tip for the gentleman: you must wear long pants to dinner, even the buffet. We did not know this ahead of time, fortunately my husband brought 1 pair of pants and wore them over & over. Also bring your sunblock it is expensive around $20 a bottle, on the other hand, you can get about any type of medicine you want at the pharmacy without a prescription. Keep in mind this beach also allows topless sunbathing and the European women sunbathe this way. We will definitely return to the Riu Palace. The Palace seem to be the higher end resort compared to some of the other Riu Hotels. This resort was a nice mix of families, young & older couples as well as many Europeans.

The only only complaint I have, and its nothing to do with the hotel, just a daft London female of which the hotel could do nothing about. Some middle aged woman who obviously had to much to drink must of bought one of the beach wear dresses from the models that show off their goods every couple of days and proceeded to try and model it round the pool the same as the models did. It was very embarrassing , she must of been drunk, she had been showing of her expensive rolex all day prior to this, thats if it was real.

We are in our late 20's and travelled with another couple. We were welcomed with a delicious cocktail and given great rooms upon request (rooms 2063 and 2064.. both highly recommended). Ya so we were given one key on a string.. really, who cares? I don't let minute things like that bother me. I also didn't mind the heat. Isn't the HEAT something you go on vacation for? Our rooms were lovely and clean yet had a slight dampness that was gone by the second day. The view from our room was great! Could watch the nightly entertainment from our balcony while having a drink from the well-stocked mini-bar. It was re-filled every day with 3 1-litre bottles of water. Our maid was great, we always came back to lots of towels and turn-down service at night. The food at the buffet was excellent and well varied. Something different every night. We went to 2 a la cartes, Krystal and the Steakhouse.. Krystal was good (great salmon and pumpkin soup!) and the Steakhouse was just ok.. the dessert was the best part (flaming Baked Alaska). Our group preferred the buffet, also because we didn't like to be on a schedule (a la carte reservation times are only at 6:45 and 8:00pm). Not one of us got sick from the food, and my husband is super susceptible to illness (had to go to emergency as soon as we got off the plane from the DR a few years ago). The drinks were great. I highly recommend the Caribbean Orange and the Banana Mama for the beach (with MUCHO alcohol, if that's your thing.. they will give it to you! No complaints of weak drinks here.. you just need to ask for it!!) and I really liked the white wine (specifically \"Diavolo\" brand) at dinner and while watching the shows. The beach was large and beautiful. Tons of chairs. No palapas, but we prefer palm tree shade to palapas any day, makes the beach seem so much more natural and pretty. The water was an amazing turquoise colour and warm. Some days it was real seaweed-y, but just get over the initial entry to the water (where all the seaweed collects) and the water was beautiful and clear. We only went to the pool once to see what it was like. We aren't pool people. It was really warm.. kind of gross warm. Could only imagine what kind of \"things\" were floating around in there. I chose not to think about it while I was in the water. Had a couple drinks (which were great by the way, a mojito and a Coco Rosa), got out of there and headed back to the beach. The staff couldn't do enough to help you here. The drink service was great, no matter where you were. So many guys walking around on the beach with trays of drinks (felt sorry for them because of the heat) and someone was over to your table every 5-10 minutes to ask if you want something during the evening on the patio. The buffet service was a little hit and miss during dinner, but meh, I certainly wasn't in a rush. We went to Chichen Itza while we were there. If you go, prepare for the hottest day of all time. Make sure you have a hat!!! And lots of water!! You will sweat buckets just standing still in the shade. Worthwhile experience though! The Mayan show on Sunday in the courtyard was EXCELLENT. Those guys look and sound like they truly enjoy what they do! Fantastic music, dancing and costumes!! Overall, the Riu Palace Mexico is a hotel that you just can't go wrong for with the price we paid. I had done so much research on hotels beforehand and I'm so glad that we chose this one.

I wouldn't leave anything lying around in any hotel room at home or abroad no matter what star it is! 7.Limited amount of water bottles in rooms-never had a problem with this either, I drink at least 2 litres a day & if we were getting low I just kindly asked one of the room maids to top my fridge up(as you would) Overall smashing hotel, lovely food (and I am VERY funny with food abroad) lots of choice, drinks equally spot on, always served good strong measures of Smirnoff/ plied you with never ending wine/champagne if you so wished! Lots of sports to take part in in the daytime, gym well enough equipped for your holiday, staff cannot help you enough & do not sniff round for tips. I suppose the down sides ARE- It does stink in the lobby reception. Not the most inviting entrance smell, but you hardly sit in reception all holiday! The evening entertainment is pretty crap but isn't it always.They do try hard though. The rooms are a little old fashioned, but equipped with everything I needed. Oh and if I wanted to take cake/fruit from the restaurant for later no one every stopped me(I only did it on odd occasion, not like I wanted to take a whole cake every sitting) I think there are some seriously odd people who call this hotel terrible. Most probably the same ones who clicked their fingers, said\"rum and coke \"& then ignored the waiter when he returned with the drink. You know, normal people who have manners & give and take a little will enjoy this hotel. To add also we had torrential storms for 3 days out of 7 and I still enjoyed it!!", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belfast", "Title": "\u201cExcellent - highly recommend\u201d", "Author": "BelfastLadydee", "ReviewID": "UR115749642", "Content": "Just arrived back from a two weeks break in the Riu Palace Mexico, Playa del Carmen, this hotel is absolutely beautiful and I have to say the staff are excellent.

Please tip the staff as they don't get payed very well and they work so hard. We left this hotel feeling we made friends with some members of the staff, one person in particular I would like to thank is Omar from the entertainment team, he is such good crack and very good at getting people involved in the daily activities. You couldn't be bored at this hotel - all watersports are included expect motorised watersport, we went kayaking, did body boarding and you could do scuba, windsailing, catamaran and these are only the beach activities. The beach is beautiful. At the pool area there is something to suit both male and female, both young and old. We personally took part in the aqua aerobics, salsa dancing and water volleyball, my husband did riffle shooting, horse shoes and volleyball. The buffet restaurant was excellent, once a week you could do a kitchen tour and you can see how clean the staff keep it. We actually choose this hotel because of the reviews about the food and we where not disappointed. The specialty resaturants are also excellent, especially Kystral, yum now i feel hungry... Rooms are excellent but the view from the balcony was not great. Weather wise we had a few wet days at the start of the holiday, on the third day there was a crazy thunder storm but after that the weather was hot hot hot - we would definately go back at this time of year. 5th Avenue is about a 30min walk, we walk in and out a few times and we didnt have any problems, very safe but i would still advice not to walk alone.

We had no problems making reservations at any one of the speciality restaurants. We chose the 6:45 sitting...a good choice this gave us time to relax afterwards in the courtyard and enjoy the nightly music and the shows. Other than that not much nightlife. The staff were very accommodating and pleasant. I was amazed by how happy the staff was. In fact I asked one of the head waiters in the courtyard why she was so happy, she said, \"I just Love my job\" this means a lot to a visitor. Some tips: If you are American make sure you get some local currency prior to your visit. We had trouble changing American dollars at the hotel. Also do not carry large denomination bills, keep it to $20's The rooms were very nice however there was a musty smell from the humidity, daily we would open the sliding glass doors to let some fresh air in -- it did the trick. We spent most of the time near the pool, just loved it. The beach--we spent a little time on the beach, it was beautiful and we had no problem getting beach chairs, there are hundreds of them and if you can't find one near the water then just move it from under the palm trees. While we were there we had a lot of rain. So be prepared for that. Also visited the famous 5th Avenue. It was something to see but hesitated to return because we were hounded by people selling timeshare, excursions, and especially hounded by locals trying to sell their wares. One man was very creative at trying to sell us goods from his mothers store he jumped out at us identifying himself as our waiter at the hotel, we had not even been to dinner yet!

Overall the hotel is beautiful with immaculate grounds. It's on the older side so the rooms could do with a bit of an update...especially the bathroom. However everywhere is spotlessly clean and rooms have everything you need including a flat screen TV (that we did not switch on during the entire three weeks of our stay.) For the last two years we have stayed in room 2128 which is in a great location overlooking one of the pools. Food - is very good for an AI - not 5* but you would be hard pressed to not find anything to suit your palette. This year we only ate in the buffet but there are several themed restaurants if you prefer a change from the buffet. Again, I would say that these are good but not exceptional....but it is nice to be waited on sometimes. Pools/beach - The beach is gorgeous with blindingly white sand and water the most beautiful turquoise colour you will ever see. Lots of sunbeds and some hammocks as well as plenty of palm trees for shade. Two pools...one of which has a swim up bar and tends to be busier and noisier than the second pool. We prefer the quieter pool but it horses for courses so you do have a choice. No trouble getting beds or shades in either area whilst we were there. There is waiter service by the pools and the staff frequently come onto the beach as well with a selection of drinks if you don't feel like getting up and going to the beach bar. Entertainment - the animation team have a selection of things going on during the day (rifle shooting, boules, ping pong, water aerobics, dancing lessons, spanish lessons etc) but they do not bother you if you say no. The entertainment at night is pretty low key, music by the bandstand and shows a bit later on in the theatre....not great, but you can pass the time quite happily as long as you are not expecting 'las vegas' type quality. Drinks - I read in quite a few reviews about drinks being watered down. I'm not a big drinker so I can't say I've noticed that myself....but they taste good to me and if you want more alcohol you just need to ask for it and they are happy to oblige. Staff/service - ah well this is where the hotel really excels as far as I'm concerned. Efficient and friendly from the top to the bottom and they really do want you to have a good time. The same excellent service (whether you tip or not) for everyone. I hope the Riu directors appreciate the calibre of their staff ...they are what make us come back year after year.

The hotel grounds are immaculate and the customer service is superior. We were greeted with a fresh tropical -non-alcoholic, drink at check in. ROOMS: The rooms were perfect, we had rooms closest to the pool. We had a double bed and there was a pull out couch. The beds were not as hard as some people mentioned in other reviews. The pillows were on the flat side, but I doubled up and had no problems. The AC in our room worked perfectly, in fact, I had to raise the temperature and turn off the ceiling fan because we were cold at night. The rooms are a bit dated, but nothing was broken or worn out. There is a flat screen TV that is bolted to the dresser. It would have been nice if the TV was on a stand that could swivel, but no biggie. The pull out mattress was old and uncomfortable. once completely pulled out, the bed wasn't flat, it was on an incline. So, we decided to take out the mattress and put it on the floor. That is where our daughter slept. We asked for extra linens and at turn down service both our beds and the mattress were readied for us. The rooms were cleaned thoroughly, furniture is pulled away from walls and floors were spotless. We didn't have any issues with noise. POOL: The pool is smaller than other resorts we've been to, but since we were traveling with a 5 and 6 year old, it was perfect for them. We spent a lot of time at the swim up bar and the girls liked ordering Shirley Temples. The water was warm and the pool was clean. ACTIVITIES: There was plenty to do at the resort. We participated in water aerobics, volley ball, bingo, and towel art. The evening entertainment was fun. There was a Michael Jackson show, a tropical show, the circus, and Mexican night (with a live mariachi band -this was our favorite). There was also live jazz and latin music. KIDS: The Riu Animacion team was fabulous. There weren't many kids at the resort, but this only ensured the girls were taken care of fabulously! There is a small kids pool, mostly for toddlers I would say, but since the main pool was not deep, that is were the girls spent most of their time. Behind the kiddie pool is the mini club which opened from 10:30 to 1:30 and again from 3 to 5pm. The girls spent time coloring and making crafts. The team then took them to the pool to play games and even took them to lunch! At night, there is a mini disco at 8pm and the team put together themed shows for the kids. The girls loved it! They always rushed through dinner to make sure they didn't miss the mini disco. The grounds were completely safe that we felt comfortable letting them run to the Lounge were the mini-disco took place. BEACH: The beach grounds were immaculate. There were plenty of chairs and could always find a nice spot to sun bathe. Our 5 year old did notice the topless women, but wasn't shocked. She thought it was a good idea to make sure women got an even tan! Bar tenders were attentive and brought drinks to us and the girls. We took a long walk along the beach and the beach at the resort is one of the biggest and best kept in the area, including other RIU resorts. FOOD: The buffet was great. There were plenty of options to choose from, although towards the end it does get repetitive. The specialty restaurants were great. We eat at the Japanese and Steakhouse and were able to get 6:45 reservations. There are only two sittings, but my husband made sure to get up early to get the earlier sitting. The only thing I wish the resort had, were snacks - like chips, peanuts, and the like, especially at the bars. Drinks abound, but it would be nice to have some chips and salsa as you drink your margarita and enjoy the evening shows. OTHER: I liked the free wi-fi access at the lobby. We didn't experience any missing items from our room and always used the safe for our valuables. This was definitely an awesome stay and we can't wait to go back!

Wine was good and bottle left on table without having to ask. Food in speciality restaurants was wonderful. However if you don't get downstairs to make a reservation by 9:00 a.m. you are out of luck. We ate in 3 of the specialty restaurants and each time there were some empty tables. What a shame for those who wanted to eat there and were too late. Beach was probably the prettiest I've ever seen. No rocks, beautiful white sand, and crystal clear water. Stayed by the beach the whole time. Went into the pool once for water aerobics. Pool area looked nice but small. Service with a smile - everyone working there was so friendly and accommodating. Nice people who deserved the few extra dollars they received. Spa - Had a wonderful swedish massage. With the $25 credit we had, the massage was very affordable. Wanted to go back the next day but the sun came out and the beach won. Cons- Towel card - found this very obnoxious the first few days, got used to it after than. You are allowed one towel and one towel only. You get a plastic card upon checkin that you are warned not to lose. This is your ticket each day to get a towel. Annoying? Yes. Can you live with it? Yes. Beach drink service - I read here that there was beach drink service. Not so much. I have no problem getting up and walking the 50 feet to the beach bar but have never stayed anywhere that didn't have beach bar service. Also, drinks at the beach bar was very very watered down. Only the one bar inside the lobby which got very crowded in the evening, especially on rainy nights. All in all I had a great time, the price was right and I would probably go back for that beach if for no other reason.", "Date": "June 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cworth every dime\u201d", "Author": "pinda91", "ReviewID": "UR114671953", "Content": "The Riu Palace was by far the nicest , most relaxing , beautiful resort for us to date. we have travelled for the past seven years with two other couples .

I will say one thing. if you get a room with a wall on your balcony you may wish to switch to a room with a view , unless you dont care about sitting out on your balcony which we did. there is live entertainment in the gazebo every night, usually a band or single talented singer so it was nice to sit out and listen on the balcony. They do stop the live music for an hour to some very loud annoying guy do the typical just married and kids stuff but all in all you can just shut your door. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The beach is beautiful and if you wanted to you could walk on the boardwalk all the way to Playa Del Carman. The hard working staff keep the beach clean, there is a bbq on the beach and they actually come around and serve drinks . The palace grounds are immaculate and the garden view from the rooms with the fountains and greenery are georgeous. The food is excellent, buffet has everything and the smokers eat outside so nobody smokes indoors if that bothers you, I must say we werent too keen on the all day excursions, it is just too long and it is hard to be away from such a beautiful resort . 1/2 day would be great.

We did an extensive amount of research narrowing the search to Playacar, St Johns and Dominican. In the end Playacar won because of the price and excursions available. None of the group was disappointed. The RIU Palace Mexico exceeded our expectations. It is wonderful! Greeted at check-in with a tropical drink. Rooms were great, food was great. Our only complaint other than we had to leave after a week was the pillows were a little flat and my club sandwich from room service was not that great. That seems like such a small things, but really that was the only negative.We read several poor reviews- those people are crazy. No musty odor. Food in the buffet was wonderful. Staff was extremely friendly. We wakled the beach in both directions this resort has the BEST BEACH! When walking the beach do not forget to stop in at other RIU properties and fill up your drink- all are reciprocal with the Palace. Here are a few tips: Bring an insulated mug-drinks are served in small plastic cups Ask for a room close to the pool, away from the plaza. We ate at two the the restraunts Crystal and Steak place-both good, but the buffet was also good. Save all of you shopping for 5th Ave in Playa del Carmen - better selection and much better prices. Shopping at Playcar and on excursions is expensive. When shopping barter, do not be afraid to walk away. We had several vendor chased us down after we left to offer better prices. A initial price of 65 us became 20 us by walking away. The swimming pool at the RIU Yucatan is a nicer pool. Thake your mug and spend some time there. We went to Xcarat, private snorkeling for 12 and Chitzen Itza. All were booked at the RIU after we got there. All were good trips for a good price although not cheaper than online. It was nice to have a person if there had been a problem. You will be approached by people wanting to sell you stuff, if you are not interested just say \"no grasis\" and they go away.

The \"champagne\" was delicious and light to drink. We personally, found the weather a bit too hot but took to sailing at the hottest times or went and lay in the hammocks in the shade. If you like Spanish, i recommend the lessons with Diderot at 12 pm, another chance to sit in the shade with a cooling drink. There is also a tour of the kitchen which is interesting to do. There is entertainment every evening starting at 9.45. If you play the casino game and win some chips put them together when you cash them in and you will then have more to bid for one of the prizes! Room service was exceptional, every day the rooms were cleaned to a high standard and pretty little towel animals left on the bed. One thing that is worth noting is that with the air con on all/most of the time, the room can get rather musty and the clothes feel damp so we learned when in our room to have the doors open and the air con off for a while every day to keep the air smelling fresh. There are many trips out available, its worth talking to more than one of the reps to find out the best deals. We also recommend having a massage on the beach, late afternoon is a good time for this.

Have to say feel very relaxed. Overall Hotel \u2013 Great hotel and lovely grounds, visited all the near Riu hotels and we thought this one was bar far the best looking. Not quite sure the hotel is a true 5 Star as have stay in better. We had a room round the back, which was fine for us. Pool/Beach \u2013 Lots of sun beds to choose from, we preferred the pool area but beach always looked good. Room \u2013 room was good, but think it could do with some updating, our fan was noisy at times and sometimes woke up hot other times woke up cold. Massive beds. The only thing I would say is the water smelt like they recycled it from the pool, but I may be wrong. We had no problems with things going missing, but I did make sure we left things locked up in the safe at all times and didn\u2019t leave items lying around on the side, in our 10 day stay we heard of no other problems. Only hint is the coffee machine is slighty strange and no tea making, so might be worth taking a kettle. Food \u2013 main buffet restaurant plenty of choose but sometimes at dinner things didn\u2019t quite go together, ok if you like a bit of a miss match. Found the beach restaurant slightly better for lunch. Also never had any problems booking any of the 4 below restaurants. La Bodega \u2013 was ok nothing special El Patio \u2013 was ok nothing special have been to much better steak houses so don\u2019t get your hopes up Fusion \u2013 was lovely nice meal Miyagi \u2013 was our favourite and eat there twice Drinks \u2013 Yes agree that they were probably watered down, but hay after a bottle or 2 of wine in the restaurants was never a problem, mini bar stocked up daily and loved the fact their was bar staff walking around all day, so I never had to move. Majority of staff where very friendly. Activities \u2013 Plenty going on and reps never over hassled you. Evening entertaining was dreadful more like butlins but have to say here was much better than Tequila which was differently butlins aboard! We also had a photo session with Calypso who where great and didn\u2019t feel pressured into buying any of the photo\u2019s Playa Del Carmen \u2013 good 30min + walk if you walk by the beach but it is a nice one, be warned that as you go past every shop they do ask you to come in and look at there stock.

You really can't even go by the reviews because there is such a vast array of people vacationing here. I am an average, no-frills-but-like-nice-things person.. and a slight perfectionist. If you're very froo froo, travel frequently and require nice things, you might not be satisfied. If you are more honky-tonk (you know if you are :D ) and you don't travel much, you will love it more than life. I am right down the middle, so I really enjoyed it. 1. The beach: It's beautiful and clean.. tons of palm trees, tons of chairs, nice breeze.. definitely one of the best I've seen. Downsides are, jetski noise and exhaust.. chairs are abundant, but TOO packed together.. Also, it's a topless beach! So if you've got them, flaunt them! If you are going with children/kids and you mind them seeing boobies, you might feel uncomfortable. You can also see Cozumel far away.. Cool. 2. The pool: Water was warm, and it seemed small/narrow. We didn't have trouble finding a chair, so that was nice. Swim up bar was sort of \"icky\".. weird smells. the grounds are well kept, the palms are healthy and beautiful. 3: Food: We ate at Krystal, it was very good. Steakhouse was not, nor was the service. Buffet is good, lots to pick from. Anything and everything.. and the staff is fabulous! Coffee is strong.. it was too strong for me to drink. And I drink Starbucks!! 4: Drinks: Weak, weak, weak. Ask for a shot on the side of whatever you want in it. Beer is Dos Equis. Not bad. Cubano bar serves the weakest drinks. 5: Rooms: They are ok. I stayed at the RIU Aruba which was nice. This room was ok, needed updating..but who cares. We did have a few broken things.. iron, ironing board, light, lamp and toilet. Sounds like a lot, but we called and they came to fix things within 5 minutes. Rooms were clean, and cleaned promptly. Housekeeping staff left flowers too.. 6: Entertainment: Um, not very entertaining. Cuban dancer were great, the variety/Beatles show was terrible! hahahaa... Mr. RIU show was funny.. 7: Service: VERY good. All very humble, genuine and attentive people. If you want to go for relaxation and eating.. you will love it. It seemed to be a slow week. Not very crowded at all.. only a few children too. Overall I had a great time and would go back, but might try RIU Riviera Maya down the road a bit. It's newer. Also, a room booking tip. Ask for Courtyard view (Jr Suite Superior) on the second floor \"at the end\". It faces the inside, so you won't see other hotels or brick walls.. and the end is furthest from the restaurants and theater so the noise will be less.

Of course, cannot forget the beach! It was gorgeous! We loved the hamacs and the natural shade provided by tons of palm trees. The beach bar was also awesome! the water is beautiful and there are waiters on there too. We love the attention of the staff at the beach from the scuba team! they were great too!

Our group was 16 people (13 adults and 3 kids). We stayed 6 nights. Booking for the group directly through Riu groups and events was easy- no issues and very responsive. The wedding reception and other group events we booked went flawlessly. There was a full staff to accommodate the group for our reservation at the private restaurants. Service was excellent; never had to ask for drinks or clear dishes- very proactive and attentive. All of the adults enjoyed the food: appetizers, main course were all excellent. The hotel is beautiful with granite throughout the lobby. Excellent doorman and we were always greeted well. The grounds were beautiful and very well maintained. You have to love the tons of palm trees down to the beach. There were plenty of chairs available in the sun and shade. The rooms were great and spacious. My two complaints about my experience (specifically for a wedding party) was (1) there was a billing mistake on Riu\u2019s part, which was minor. I asked for a corrected bill from the Riu group coordinator and offered to pay in cash that day (again very minor $\u2019s). I did not receive the bill but got a bit of a nasty note stating our events were going to be cancelled if I don\u2019t pay the bill. Not the type of note you want the day before the wedding and I already paid the group contract in full prior to arrival. Overall, the Riu group coordinator could have handled the billing issue better since it was their mistake. And (2) the day of the wedding our photographer showed up at the hotel and the front desk called our room and stated that it will cost $800USD to allow an \u201coutside vendor\u201d on the property. We hired an independent photographer that is not associated with the hotel. Riu, like other hotels, want their cut since we did not use their expensive photographer who is associated with the hotel. I would assume this issue would arise at any all-inclusive hotel when using an outside vendor. One tip: We ordered flowers from a local shop in town two days before the wedding. We brought in pictures of what we wanted and picked the flowers at the shop. The flowers were beautiful and delivered to the hotel on time. Total cost was $60USD for all roses and included two bouquets (bridal and bridesmaid), three boutonnieres, and delivery charge. The hotel was charging $125USD for one bridal bouquet alone. Overall, great hotel, staff, service, and food. I would definitely do it again.", "Date": "May 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cNice & Relaxing\u201d", "Author": "Cornerlot_10", "ReviewID": "UR109966885", "Content": "Pros...Great service.

My family and I traveled - my parents both ages 52, myself (26) and my younger brother (20) decided that it's been too cold of a winter in Toronto and I had been away at school for too long. We booked our trip through one of the last minute travel companies in Toronto, which even though it was still a Sunquest trip worked out ~$50-75 cheaper than if we had booked with Sunquest directly. The package from Sunquest included flight (WestJet), hotel transfer and the all-inclusive hotel. We had no problems going through the terminal and meeting our Sunquest agent who got us to the hotel promptly. Keep in mind that the hotel is an hour away from the airport in Cancun - use the restroom before you leave the airport. Upon arrival at the Riu we were immediately greeted by the doorman, who took care of our bags and ushered us in to the front desk. Great staff! I had emailed ahead to confirm our booking, request rooms close together and to tell them we were down for my birthday. The guy at the desk clearly had read the email, wished me happy birthday and had drinks ready for us as we were checking in - real smooth. The room wasn't ready when we arrived, so he took our bags and showed us where to get lunch. We had a pretty standard room, great view of ...the security fence. Didn't matter much, we were only in the rooms to cool off after being at the beach or to sleep. The beds were comfy, pillows starched (but still soft) and the TVs were new Sony Bravias which had their fair share of English - German and Spanish programs. With regards to the \"musty\" smell that previous posters have reported. It's there when you walk into the hotel, but you become accustomed to it within 10-15 minutes. It's not present in the rooms and I venture the hotel recognizes it, when we got to our room there was this neat little box that looked like a heavy duty air freshener - it apparently worked because our room smelled fine. No nasty encounters with any bugs to thankfully report. Food - The food is excellent. There is nice variety at the Don Julien buffet restaurant. Breakfast is pretty standard fare - waffles, toast, pancakes, fruit, cereal, cold cuts, cheeses, eggs, sausage, bacon, hashbrowns, there's a whole lot more but you get the idea. I'm going to highlight two big breakfast favourites - the donuts! I know, seems crazy, but they're little round things of sugary greatness that are not too sweet but so satisfying. Also, the omelette senoritas are top notch - they were a favourite with my parents and by the end of the week they had their omelette orders memorized. Also our server Francisco whose tables we always sat at during Breakfast knew that my mom and brother drink coffee, my dad drinks tea and I try something from the smoothie station. He would even ask where the rest of the family was if only one of us showed up in the morning and I can think of one morning where my brother went down early and Francisco got a table ready for all of us. Lunch- there's a couple of beach BBQs during the week which are nice. We mostly dined by beach at the patio restaurants - one is Italian themed with pastas and pizza, the other is pretty standard American hot dogs, hamburgers, salad, etc. Again, tasty food; ketchup is a little runny (a small thing to knock them on). Favourites at lunch was the soft serve ice cream machine ...particularly watching my dad struggle to make a proper spiral cone. Dinner - we dined at all 4 of the sit down restaurants. Before we left I had read people complaining about the early time to get reservations, I was thinking that meant waking up at 6am and trudging down to the restaurant. Turns out they let you make reservations from 8am - 10am - which really isn't THAT early. The only day we didnt get a reservation we wanted was when there were 3 weddings happening on the grounds. The steakhouse is probably the best of the 4 restaurants - the meat is nice and tender and was cooked exactly the way each of us asked (and we all asked for a different way). The food was good, music and ambience really nice. Big shout out to our server Ana who even went and found out who was singing and what song when my dad asked her. Next best restaurants is a tie between -the Brazilian restaurant and Krystal Gourmet/Fusion restaurant. The food was alright , certainly tasty and the decor of both places matched the theme. Brazilian was lots of different meats. Krystal was pretty good food -- get the ravioli starter if you go - my dad was the only one smart enough to do so. No complaints with the meals at either. Last restaurant - Miyagi sushi - now I'm biased because I love sushi, so I probably had an unreasonable expectation for them to meet. The actual sushi was tasty. The tempura - was, well, not tempura. Just stuff that was fried in a different batter. Whatever else there was that was served wasn't memorable, or that great. I think I probably got sick from something I ate at Miyagi so I'm really not that big of a fan...this was the ONLY bad food encounter on the trip. I'm a Dr. so came ready expecting the worst sickness ever -- fortunately we never had any serious problems with the food. Beach & Grounds- The beach is nice; they work really hard to keep everything super clean. I'm usually awake early and the grounds-crew was out early cleaning everywhere up early in the morning. Lawns and hedges were well trimmed, beach was even raked. By the end of the day, the beach looked like a disaster zone - there are a lot of filthy tourists out there - and yet by the next morning, the beach was pristine again. I brought pool shoes because I had read that the beach was rocky -- never used them. The sand gets warm by the afternoon, but on the well traversed areas, they'll pour water on the sand to cool it off. The water is clear and the swimming area varies from pretty calm to a few nice rolling waves - great if you want to relax OR boogie board. There's a good number of hammocks which were comfy, well shaded and great to fall asleep in. Never struggled to get a beach chair in the shade- including securing 4 together for the whole family. Activities - This is where RIU really shines; hands down they have a great location to work with but what takes them from being a 4.5 star to a 5 star hotel is the incredible service. I want to highlight their entire entertainment staff who made our vacation memorable. By the end of our stay, pretty much all of their entertainment folks knew our names. They have a great entertainment program - rifle shooting, bocci ball, darts, volleyball, water aerobics, ping pong. First off, Omar is awesome - he's out there dancing around and full of energy - I'm going to venture he's my mom's favourite since she went to everyone of his dance classes and water aerobics. Next, Diderot is the man - he and my brother played countless games of volleyball and Diderot got my (sometimes) reclusive father out playing ping pong a few afternoons which is NOT an easy task. Aida is new but seamlessly has integrated into the staff, really catching and building off of Omar's energy. Cris and the other evening show announcer (whose name I forget- sorry!) are both hilarious on stage, easily going between languages so that the whole audience can participate. Everyone else on the entertainment staff is great, they may be the best kept secret at the resort and definitely go out of their way to make guests feel welcome. I know in the evenings, they'll even accompany guests to the various nightclubs around ensuring they go out and get back safely - definitely above and beyond. The evening shows were always fun to watch. Obviously its not your Broadway-esque performances but they made for a fun evening. The servers in the theatre are really prompt with bringing drinks, it almost seems like they're paid per drink served because your glass never gets empty. It's a nice touch that they give away a prize and certificate to the winners of the various activities from the day - I won a nice haul of RIU trinkets thanks to my bocci ball success. We went on one excursion while there to Chichen Itza, really because it's a recognizable landmark. It's a couple hours away and was an ok trip. We got to jump into the cenote out there which was fun and refreshing. There were a bunch of other excursions out there that the various travel reps would have willingly setup, but we were pretty content to relax around the resort. In summary, this was an excellent vacation. It's a difficult and daring task to plan a vacation in my family because EVERYTHING has to go right and the slightest error will result in endless taunting and torment from the rest of the family. As the lead planner on this one, I read tripadvisor endlessly before deciding. I'm thankfully happy to say that there were no complaints from anyone during our trip. We all had a great time and would willingly go back again.", "Date": "May 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Springfield, IL", "Title": "\u201cRIU - You're the BEST!\u201d", "Author": "ILGrammy60", "ReviewID": "UR109258363", "Content": "Hubby and I just returned from the RIU Palace Mexico. Our stay was magnificient. The weather was 85 - 88 degrees, sunny with pleasant ocean breeze. Everything was PERFECT. Our garden view room balcony on the second floor 2010 overlooked heart shaped bushes and a beautiful sculpture. The food was delicious at all of the restaurants. We were able to make reservations each morning when we went for breakfast at the restaurant of our choice for the seating of our choice. There are two seatings: 6:45 & 8:45PM. Our favorite was the Krystal. I enjoyed the Sea Bass, Pumpkin soup and chocolate cake. Atmosphere, service, presentation and taste were flawless. The pools are beautiful and clean. There is a huge mosaic tile rose at the bottom of one of the pools. Pool servers bring soda, water or alcohol right to your lounge chair. The beach is golden sand and clear water. No rocks like Cancun. Palm trees provided plenty of shade, a combination of sun and shade. There plenty of lounge chairs at the pools and on the beach so no need to rush down in the morning to reserve a place. Hubby and I went to Play del Carmen to go to church and visited the 5th Avenue market. We also went to the little shopping plaza across the street from the hotel. We were content to spend the rest of our time on the property enjoying the resort and our room. The bulding and grounds are more beautiful and luxurious that the pictures portray. We did our homework before we went and found the hotel to far exceed our expectations in every way. We talked with at least four couples who were return guests. One couple came from Germany and spent 2 weeks last year. They liked it so much they are back for four weeks this year. Another couple from England came back after about five years. Europeans outnumbered Americans but everyone was friendly and most spoke fluent English. This is not an adults only but there were very few children. There is a dinner dress code for men. Men are required to wear long pants, jeans are ok, collard shirt and shoes or dress sandals. We went to the buffet our first night there and my husband was politely asked to change into pants for dinner. We would not recommend this hotel for families traveling with children or for young adults who are intested in heavy drinking and partying. We would recommend this for 40+ year olds who want a luxurious, relaxing, quiet, getaway with gourmet food and outstanding service. This is our 5th RIU stay but our 1st \"Palace\" stay.

Here is the repost and some additions. The hotel is beautiful, the grounds were very well maintained and our room was lovely. I enjoyed my trip tremendously...BUT...(sorry Riu but I have to do this) I also had 3 roach sightings...one near the food preparation area near the buffet, one in my room and a third in the lobby. I have to say that I was a little bummed out about this and had a hard time sleeping at night. I'm just glad it was on the 6th night of our 7 night trip and not earlier on because that would have ruined the entire trip for me. Get some exterminators out RUI....it's kind of a buzz kill and can ruin vacations for people!!! I also noticed that musty smell I've heard others complain about and have a suitcase full of clothing and other items that reak of it. Not really sure what can be done about this and it's not a huge deal, but it is a little annoyance that would be best taken care of. Thirdly, the food was just ok...mediocre at best. I was really looking forward to Mexican night in the hopes of having some authentic mexican food, but I was hugely disappointed. However, I always found something to eat, but mostly stuck with the make your own pasta and salads. Not what I was hoping for, but it did just fine!!!!!! Because I paid up front for a package that I feel includes all meals and drinks, not being able to have a variety of foods and having to stick with certain things that I eat back home all the time, I feel I was a little ripped off in this area, but again, just mentioning for the sake of giving a fair review that others can benefit from and base thier decision on when making thier own travel plans in the future. Lastly, the walls are paper thin and you can hear everything going on in the hallway and above you. Unfortunately for me and my spouse, we had a very noisy guest above us. We heard every step (in heels) that person took and it lasted for a good hour, sometimes longer, in the mornings when still ready to wake up and again in the evenings when trying to got to sleep...way past midnight! It's not like we expected peace and quiet at 8:00 PM. On the to the praises. The staff is courteous and always willing to accomodate! We had no problems at this hotel.

The specialty restaurants are all great, except the fusion, that one was not that good. We happened to be there on holy week, when all of Mexico goes on vacation. It was a bit crowded but not overbearing. Every night, the hotel put on a different dance show, and every night they had a few dancers spend some time prancing around with the kids. The pool is somewhat small, with no easy entry/exit ramps. The liquor was not top shelf but was sufficient. The beach is excellent, with plenty of shade for those that want to stay out of the sun. One piece of advise, do not buy anything that anyone is trying to sell to you. be it an obsedian turtle, or a silver necklace, or a wooden mayan mask. Chances are, the price is hiked up three times the worth, and it is poorly made. They will all swear that whatever they're selling is made by their own hand, it isn't.

From dinner at the buffet with great variety of quality food closely monitored by great Chef Neftaliand His crew. Waiters were very attentive and courteous. Breakfast at the buffet was just too much to ask for, plenty of fresh fruit, juices, tasty sides and the egg lady made great omelets. Dinner a la carte was great too. The Brazilian restaurant was okay. The steak house restaurant had great meat and seafood entrees. The Japanese restaurant was great too, good sushi, tempura the tamarind shrimp main dish and fried ice cream for dessert. And finally the best for last, Krystal Restaurant with fusion food, extraordinay, the shrimp ravioli entrees were great with a very delicate exquisite white sauce, the main dish had a nice steak with mushroom mouse sauce to die for and for dessert a passion fruit and coconut mouse. The shows were good, I missed most of the first part because I always had supper at 8:45 p.m. and by the time I would be finished eating well the shows were almost over. I ate three nights at the buffet and gladly one of those nights happened to be the Gala night theme, which had lobster on the grill, shrimp, steaks etc. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone Who is looking for quality per price service, food and installations. As a Riu Palace guest I could visit all the sister Riu hotels but not one was as nice or had the quality of service of the Riu Palce Mexico, not even the Riu Palace Mexico.

Most of us are already planning our return trip next year. I truly cannot say anything negative about the Riu Palace Mexico. Everything exceeded my expectations, and that is hard to do. We travelled from 3/27 to 4/2. The weather was great!!!!! The service great!!!!! The food was the best I have eaten at an all inclusive resort!!!!! The beach was huge and the pool area was big enough. We rarely had a problem securing lounge chairs at the pool or the beach. There were plenty of activities for the kids (snorkeling, boogie boards, volleyball). They even had a towel folding class for the little kids who got to keep the animal they made. They offer parasailing and jet-sking right on the beach! We did both and loved it. My husband also took an introductory SCUBA lesson and went on an ocean dive!!!! I LOVED laying on a lounge on the beach and having a waiter bring me a drink......TOTAL RELAXATION!!!!! You never need to walk too far to get a drink either. As for the four restaurants, they were all good, but our favorite was Fusion, followed by the steakhouse, then the Japanese and finally the Brazilian steakhouse. Getting up early to make the reservation for these places is a bit inconvenient, but well worth it. We were lucky that a different family volunteered to make the reservations each day. The buffet is EXCELLENT!!!! Great variety and quality. The rooms do smelly musty, but after a while you don't even think about it. In that regard, be prepared to wash ALL clothing when you return as the musty smell follows you home. We have two children (10 and 14). The beds are small, so we asked for a cot. One daughter slept on the cot and the other slept on the couch. We were not in the room too much so it didn't matter!!!! There was nightly entertainment in the beautiful courtyard, as well as the theater. We walked into Playa del Carmen one day!!!!! About 25 minutes, but worth it to get a feel for the town. The rooms were always clean. Of course some items were moved around, but how can you clean without moving anything? RECOMMENDATIONS: Bring larger plastic cups for the pool/beach area. The cups they provide are small so require more refills. Bring some type of stomach medicine. Immodium worked for me. You can also go to the pharmacy across the street and buy Cipro. My husband was worried about traveling to Mexico, but even he felt perfectly safe!!!! We did an excursion to Xel-Ha. Well worth the money!!! I LOVED THIS PLACE!!!!!!! BTW, we booked through FunJet.

This was our annual \"gals\" trip, with the main goal of relaxing, catching some sun and just generally taking it easy. Last year I introduced my friend to the Riu Palace and she liked it so much that she suggested we go back - no quarrel from me, especially as I was able to obtain a very good price for our package, after a bit of internet research. My advice - never pay the brochure price, especially if you are coming from the U.S or Canada - you can always find discounted rates. I obtained a good deal from beachdestinations.com, which included a direct flight from Ottawa to Cancun on Westjet, so I was very pleased. Anyway, on to the review. We travelled April 12-19th, and the weather was spectacular - 30 degrees celsius or so every day, and not a drop of rain. When we arrived I requested an upgrade, (from the standard room to a courtyard view - not a big deal) and the hotel accomodated us. Food in the buffet was very good, and we ate there every night. The food tastes so incredibly fresh, especially the salads and appetizers. I noticed that in comparison to my first trip to the resort several years ago, the dessert choices have increased, and were even more tasty than before. Service was good, with the exception of one day, when we had to flag down the waiter to get refills, etc. Some of the staff recognized us from our previous trip, and welcomed us \"back home\" Again, the beach was lovely, but had a bit of a drop off - not really a problem, just more of an observation. The beach is very wide, and although it does not have palapas, it does have dozens of palm trees, so finding shade was not an issue. I noticed as well that beach chairs seemed available throughout the day, which is unusual (for any resort) amongst my 20 + resort vacation experiences. Pool chairs seem to go more quickly. One thing that I especially like about the Riu Palace is the large courtyard filled with tables, which is a great venue for relaxing with a drink and listening to a live band. We would leave the restaurant after dinner, grab a table, and enjoy the music. Service was very good, and we never had an empty glass. As the resort is located within the gated community of Playacar, there was never any sense of a lack of safety, people could walk around at night without much concern. I have been in Playa del Carmen many times, so we went out into the town only once, and again its the same thing - many people about, shops and restaurants open late, and never a sense of discomfort or concern. A taxi from the hotel into town costs 70 pesos, or just under 7 dollars. Finding taxis to return to the hotel is never a problem, as there are taxi stands at almost every corner of 5th avenue. As a repeat visitor to the Riu Palace Mexico I was very pleased with my stay, and I would not hesitate to return, especially if the price was right!", "Date": "April 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "columbia missouri", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding Resort...Outstanding Vacation!\u201d", "Author": "ksappton", "ReviewID": "UR104957161", "Content": "My college aged daughter and I spent 5 nights at the RIU Palace Mexico for spring break the end of March.

By the way we ate at all 4 (if you are an early riser it is easy to get a reservation) and all were excellent. Our favorites were the Brazilian and the Fusion. The rooms are spacious and yes a bit musty but your in Mexico! Our housekeeping services were good and most days our room was cleaned early. We went to all the RIU properties except the Playacar. All very nice but the service at the RIU Palace Mexico was by far the best. The RIU Palace Riviera Maya is almost identical although newer. The pool is beautiful but we didn't think the beach area was as nice. We didn't spend much time there as there was a large crowd of very obnoxious high school students and their equally obnoxious parents who had taken over the pool.

The resort was beautiful and kept immaculate. The interior decor of the lobby was gorgeous with crystal chandeliers, marble floors, and old paintings depicting an era from when the Spainards came to Mexico. You can see the Spainish influence in much of the decor with scalloped wrought iron lights and railings all over the grounds. This was actually a smaller resort in comparison to some places we have stayed at but it was easy to get around the grounds and I enjoyed it more because it felt more comfortable. We got a great deal, 50% off the rates, for booking early but I wouldn't have paid the full price. I don't think it would have been worth it because my husband and I don't drink and eat a lot so basically we paid to stay for the location. We were upgraded from a junior suite to a full suite for free. The room was beautiful and spacious. I found the beds very comfortable. The only thing that bothered me was the smell of mustiness. When we got home I had to wash all of my clothes, even the clean ones, and air out the suitcases. Our refrigerater was stocked every day and if we wanted something more we just asked. Our room was a short distance to the beach. The beach was beautiful, clean, no seaweed, and the sand was nice. There were many palm trees to sit under if you don't like scorching in the sun all day. I am very fair skinned and burn easily. No beach service for drinks or snacks, you have to get your own. The beers and drinks were provided in smaller plastic cups. I did see some people bring their own cups and had the bartender fill them. Good idea if you don't want to keep getting up to get something to drink. No music on the beach. The area is very quiet and relaxing. The pools are small and getting older looking. They could use some updating with fresh paint and things. There are activities scheduled daily but we chose not to participate. For those of you who have children, I am not sure if there is a playground area, I didn't seen any swings. The entertainment was decent for a resort. They had different types of shows every night and also had a piano player in the lobby by one of the bars. There are four restaurants that you have to make reservations for every morning. When I am on vacation I don't like being on a time schedule so I ate only at the buffet. My husband ate at the Brazilian grill one night and said the food was ok. The buffets offer a large selection of different types of food and also fresh fruits and salad bar. The food was good but you have to remember they are buffets at a resort and your not going to get the same quality as you would going out to some of the restaurants in downtown Playa. Lastly, I would say the service was very good. If there is anything you need or want just ask for it, the staff will accomodate you the best that they can.

Stolen stuff: There is FREE safety box in the room. You can use that! But we never felt like the cleaner or anyone was after our things. But then again, we did use the safety box. 2. This is NOT a hotel for children or kids. Some think it's a plus, some might find it a negative thing. It's more like hotel for more gown up people who enjoy finer thing s of life ;) 3. The towels were always clean (sometimes maybe with a stain or two, but always clean). And the bed linens were dry and clean (at least during our 3weeks stay). 4. The pool was small, when compared to the ocean!! But the pool was huge enough to get a good swim around it. And if you want to use bigger pool, you can use all the other pools in all the Riu resorts. Some of our highest points of this hotel: -The service was excellent! So friendly and helping. -Lovely clean grounds. -The beach was gorgeous (we saw the beach first time at 2007 when it was very narrow with the sand bags and we loved it then too). -Lovely buffet, somedays the selection was ok, other days it was excellent!

It would be better if the vegetarian dishes had their own section (now they were among the meat dishes + some other hotel guests used the meat takers to the vegetarian dishes).

The only bad thing about this hotel it is the fact that it doesn't have wi-fi in the rooms or on the beach, not even payable. It only has a free wifi area in the hotel's lobby, where you can also pay for Internet if you didn't bring your own computer. Service was very, very good, cleanliness as well. The hotel is well maintained with nice grass areas and lovely clean fountains. At 8:30 each night there is live music (not very good singers, but nice for the atmosphere). Shows at night were also good, with lots of dances, and they had a different show each night for 2 weeks. Food is more than you can eat, and we also had sea food specialties, champagne and special nights st the main restaurant (Asian, Mexican). You have access to all the Riu in the area, where you can also eat in the morning and at lunch. We visited all of them, and we also liked Riu Palace Riviera Maya, which is a bit bigger and with the same layout. The beach is huge, with crystal clear water and white fine sand. We also had great waves in the windy days. One day we had a fiesta on the beach with salsa music played live and special food. Otherwise all days are really quiet on the beach and relaxing. It is fantastic to read a good book under a palm tree's shade. The pool is kind of small, and it doesn't have a special entrance for disabled people, but there are plenty of loge chairs at the pool, and at the beach also. You can also use the pool at Riu Yucatan very close and really huge. Rooms are big with 2 huge beds put together and a nice sitting area. We also had an umbrella in the room for rainy afternoons. They do nice towel arrangements, and put balloons and fruits in the room if you are celebrating something. In the bathroom you have a bidee next to the the toilet in separate area. A light in the shower would have been nice. Playa del Carmen is 5 minutes away in a taxi (70 pesos or 7$). It is nice for shopping, very colorful and with nice cafe places. We visited Xcaret, for which we took a taxi for 20 minutes and 14$. We then bought our tickets at the door for 69$ or 99$(plus). It is much cheaper than booking this trip through an agency (they charge you 30$ per person only for transport). I would recommend to do the Tulum trip with a taxi as well, especially if you have already been on an organized trip to Chichen Itza (which is worfy) and you had already listened to the Maya history lesson. It is much faster and cheaper. To sum up I would definitely return to Riu Palace Mexico.

They were constantly cleaning. The grounds were immaculate at all times and they were constantly scrubbing or mopping the hallways. The staff in the restaurants was equally hard working, I was very impressed. The food was good but not great. I have stayed at other equal level resorts in Mexico where the food was better. I wish the buffet had more Mexican food. The pork dishes were very good but everything else was just good. Usually, these places have three or four specialty dishes that are really good, I didn't find that here. I wish they had some way to get people who are leaving for tours early in the morning better food, they say their room service is 24 hours but you can only get very limited food for breakfast, we got fruit, coffee, juice and what they call bread which was really muffins and danish. It would have been great if they could get us some toast, simple eggs or even ham and cheese if you want a European breakfast. I was disappointed with my ability to get food before my tours. They leave so early, breakfast wasn't open yet. The food in the a la carte restaurants was extremely good but it can be tough to get a reservation. Tip: to guarantee yourself a spot, you have to be down in the theatre area no later than 8 am to get a number. You then have to wait half an hour when they actually start taking reservations at 8:30 am. It takes about 30 seconds per person so, if you\u2019re number 20, expect to be in line another 10 minutes after 8:30 to actually get your reservation and if you walk away, you lose your turn. I have to admit, waiting 40 minutes for dinner reservations was a little bit annoying but I\u2019m not sure how else they could do it in a fair way. We had organized tours that left before 8:30 three of the mornings we were there so, we couldn\u2019t get a reservation on those days which stunk because we only made it to three of the four restaurants even though we were there eight nights. The bar area with free Wi-Fi was great, you could sit, have a drink and check your email. Our tour operators were communicating with us via email so, this was a great perk. Bring your itouch or ipad and it's really convenient. Our room was very nice, it was spacious and the bed was a little hard for me but still OK. The better pillows were in the closet. It is kind of a loud place, we were on the third floor but pretty close to the lobby and were constantly hearing things crashing, I have no idea what was falling all the time but there was constant noise, even at 3 am. You may want to take a set of ear plugs with you if you\u2019re a light sleeper. The beach was awesome, I never used the pool, I\u2019m not a pool person but I love the ocean! I loved the palm trees that lined the beach, my husband likes the sun and I like the shade and we never had to fight over a palapa because the palm trees provided plenty of shade. The palm trees also make the beach more interesting, I thought it was beautiful. We also utilized the dive shop/activity shop on the beach. We took a refresher lesson on how to use the catamaran and then took it out ourselves after that and had a blast. As we were sailing, we even saw dolphins! We also took a trip with them to Cozumel for snorkeling which was fun, we saw a ton of stuff. I\u2019m an avid diver and I saw the biggest ray I have ever seen snorkeling in 25 feet of water. They also have snorkeling trips that stay in the Playa area and boogie boards. The front desk staff was extremely helpful on numerous occasions, they speak English very well and it was great to have them as a resource. You can book tours right in the lobby of the hotel if you want and even rent a car right there. We rented a car to drive to Akumal and to the Jungle Place which was very convenient, you do have to be careful, the police are more likely to pull you over because the tourists have different license plates so we are easy to spot. The driving was easy, we didn\u2019t have any problems. It was just like driving at home, potholes and all. We also went to Chichen Itza and Ek Balam which was a long trip but I was really interested to see the ruins. Ek Balam was way more interesting than I thought, they have preserved stucco that is fascinating. The shows were good, kind of the usual sort of show that you would expect in a resort, nothing great but certainly entertaining. The style of the resort is super Spanish, if you\u2019re not into that sort of thing, you won\u2019t like the style.

This resort was perfect from the moment we arrived until the time we left. The lobby is absolutely beautiful and spacious with large chandeliers, dark wood, and red velvet seating areas. Wi-Fi is only in the lobby area so we spent each evening there contacting our son back home and did not have trouble finding seating or privacy with all the other parents doing the same. We had three rooms reserved and two of the three were ready and the other took longer than they had originally told us, however we just changed clothes and all went to the beach to wait. We were there to celebrate my daughter's 21st birthday and I had emailed the hotel before we left about possibly having something small in her room to surprise her. Boy, were we surprised the entire room was decorated and it made her day. The rooms were spacious, and bathrooms large however wish our bathtub had been larger, just a standard size tub. Air conditioning was cool (we have stayed in other hotels where it was not). Balconies were nice and private. I have seen some reviews the beds are hard, they are hard if you are used to a pillow top mattress but not dated in anyway, we found them comfortable. The pool area was nice and the beach was beautiful. We have stayed in Playa before and the other resort had the big sand whales, nothing like that at the RIU. I recommend the massage by the beach, very relaxing. Food was best we have had at any other all inclusive, the buffets have many different options for everyone. We had the Brazilian and the Japanese dinners while were there and found the food to be excellent as well. The shows each night were entertaining and as other reviews have said get a seat early. Our daughter and her friend were in the front row for Beatles night, and were pulled up on stage and after the initial embarrasment they had a great time. This is not a party resort, with your wristband you can visit the other RIU's in Playa for that type of atmosphere. This would be more adult and family type atmosphere, not to say it isn't fun it just isn't the sloppy drunk obnoxious type resort. Very classy. Spent one evening shopping in Playa and felt safe the entire night, got lots of bargains be prepared to deal and walk away when they don't agree to your price. Took ferry to Cozumel one day and had a great time at the Nachi Cocum Beach Resort (another great day and worth the money take the $35 snorkeling tour you will not be disappointed.) - ferry is rough so if you get seasick take the Dramamine before you go. They had a singer on the boat to try and keep your mind off the rocking and I normally don't have a problem but I had a few moments myself.

This was our first real vacation anywhere and we definitely started at the top! First, the location: Playacar is a fabulous little gated pocket of luxury. Hand-paved streets with a couple of trees growing out of the middle in a spot or two, residential homes that shouted hefty price tags, a new condo complex all bright and shiny, and then high-end resort after high-end resort. Drivers coming into the community had to stop at a gate and hand over their drivers' license in exchange for a pass. I don't think it gets much safer than this area! The beach, the sand, the water, the trees and landscaping, everything was just gorgeous. Secondly, the service: Perfecto. Even starting back at O'Hare with the AeroMexico airline. Unfailingly polite, quick to smile, patient with the language gaps, attentive, pleasantly chatty. There were a couple of staff members at the hotel that just blew us away- Luis, our favorite by far, who we asked how the scheduling was done (11 hour days chopped into 2 shifts) and seemed to be everywhere we were. Mariely, (just call me Marley), whom we only saw briefly at the theater bar but was so much fun to talk to. The doorman, who gave us each fist-bumps and then blew them up the few times we crossed paths in the lobby. The scuba guys were so amazing, too. Fernando taught us scuba diving in the pool and the one who set up our snorkeling excursion to Maroma Paradise ($220 for the four of us) was so interesting to talk to. Apparently, there are quite a few families in the area who still speak Mayan in their homes, learn English for their jobs, and then pick up Spanish as their THIRD language to use on the streets. And of course, the weather: it was surreal. Coming from Chicago, (it snowed a bit while we were gone), it was as if we won the weather lotto. Mid-80s, breezy, partly cloudy, two brief and refreshing rainstorms (both occurred while we were in our room) and when the sun went down, mid-60s. I saw almost NO BUGS although I did manage to get one mosquito bite. Although, do not mess around with this sun. The Mexican Caribbean sun is NO JOKE. My children and I are already pretty tan even in the dead of winter (Korean blood) but my 10-yr-old daughter starting showing symptoms of sun poisoning the last day around 4:00am (headache, nausea, dizziness, fever, hives) which we had to deal with the entire day of travelling back home (cool shower, Ibuprofen, Benedryl, aloe vera with lidocaine, lots of water and 7-up). She had no visible sunburn. And we went through 3 bottles of Neutrogena SPF 70 between the four of us in 5 days. Also, had wide-brimmed sun hats for me and her, and used loungers under the trees. So, be careful! A couple of things I wish I would've known: bring more cash than you think you'll need. There's only one ATM in Playacar and it dispenses pesos. There is a Se\u00f1or Frog's down the beach heading into town (5th Ave) that has an ATM that dispenses US dollars. (It's a 20-25 minute walk from Riu Palace Mexico, saving you a $7 cab ride). Speaking of 5th Ave, you can't walk more than 3 feet without being accosted by someone selling something. Wear earphones, dark glasses and a big hat! We only lasted 4 blocks before we turned around, fed up with the harrassment. But Se\u00f1or Frog's was a groovy place to hang out before we walked back. Bring your own towel from the resort to Maroma Paradise snorkeling! No one told us we needed our own, and to rent them is $5 each. Also, the snack and sodas they tell you is included is served in a restaurant by a waiter. We only brought the reef conservation tax money ($2 each) and tipped the boat crew the last $2 we had on us. I felt really cheap getting up and walking away without tipping the server. Everyone wants a tip. Not the hotel staff! They appreciate the little extras, but they do not expect a thing and are always extremely gracious and grateful. But the shuttle/bus drivers, the boat crews, the porters at the airport, everyone outside the hotel will pretty much tell you they work for tips soooo....(insert foot tapping here). At check-in to go home, we had nothing left and the guy who walked us all the way into the line was pretty irked when we told him we were broke. If anyone wants to take your picture, or asks your name, or wants to put a sombrero on you and sing to you, they want at least $10 dollars in exchange for whatever little gimmicky trinket or souvenir they slap your picture/name on.

The all-inclusive is all you can manage and far more - the optics and beers in the suites are plentiful but if I would have one small gripe, I would suggest that the Hotel stocked one of the better known brands of beer (on tap and bottled) because despite the heat and the very relaxing atmosphere, we didn't really like what was on offer.

My husband and I are fairly active, and although there is water aerobics, volleyball, sailing and kayaking available, plus you can purchase snorkel and SCUBA trips, the general population of very friendly and happy guests that come here are mostly in it for the laying in the sun and drinking and smoking. That is all fine and good and it appears the guests were loving their vacations!! But there are no \"no smoking\" zones so if you are a non-smoker, just be prepared for the overwhelming number of people that are smoking there, especially at night in the courtyard where everyone hangs out for after dinner cocktails and the nightly show. Not the end of the world or anything, but I just wanted people to be aware that this is much more of a leisurely vacation spot - which is exactly what a lot of people want! We were at Club Med Cancun last year and found that to be a much more active population of guests, and smoking was restricted to certain areas.", "Date": "March 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cGreat Vacation at RIU Palace Mexico\u201d", "Author": "truttchy4", "ReviewID": "UR100433217", "Content": "We just returned from a 7 night vacation at the RIU Palace Mexico and we were 100% pleased. This was our second trip to the Riviera Maya, Playa del carmen area. Last year we stayed at the RIU Playacar and had such a wonderful experience, that we wanted to try another RIU in the area. The resort and grounds are absolutely as beautiful in person as it looked on line! The hotel staff were nothing but gracious, personable & very, very friendly. Our rooms were wonderful, the maid staff did a superb job always leaving us a very cleanly room. I believe they even changed the sheets each day! The food was as wonderful as last years was, always something different to choose from on the buffets. We ate at the SteakHouse, Kristal and Brazilian restaurants. The steaks at the Steakhouse & Kristal were absolutely fantastic. We live in Wisconsin and have some of the best steaks in our restaurants in the USA and these were just as delicious and prepared exactly to our order! Cudos to all of the chefs at the resort. We were not overly impressed with the food at the Brazilian restaurant... the wait staff was top notch... but most of the food was very tough to chew... a little over cooked is my guess! But maybe we just hit it on a bad night. Our only surprise was the first night for dinner we went down to the Buffet Restaurant for dinner and our husbands had on shorts and a nice shirt and they had to go back to the rooms and change into long pants. We were rather surprised at this since last year at the Playacar they could were shorts. I guess we missed that point on the website. It wasn't a big deal... but we don't really think that this was necessary for that restaurant. The guys had only brought one pair of dress pants along- thinking they'd only need them for 2-3 dinners at the \"reservation restaurants\". But with this being our only \"surprise\"... we are not complaining about it in the least!! A shout out to Jonathon at the swimup bar & Elile our breakfast waiter... you were both so much fun and amazing workers... good luck to you both in your futures! If you are considering staying at the RIU Palace Mexico don't hesitate to do so... it was a little more subdude atmosphere compared to the Tequilla... we went there several nights for drinks at the Sports Bar - which was over-run with highschool & college spring breakers.... who were over the top annoying! We saw very little of this at the Palace. We cann't wait to return again in a few vacations!

It was cheaper than the Riu Palace Riveriera Maya because it is due a refurb but you do get the same 5* service as the Maya and I thought the rooms and public areas are still really nice. Infact I would like to complement the hotel on it's service as all the staff were excellent. A special thank you needs to go to lady that worked the Lobby Bar in an evening as she was really attentative and professional. You get a good choice of known brands of spirits etc. We went across to some of the Riu Club hotels some nights and you could tell a difference in the quality of spirits compared to the good brands that the Palace served. However do try the disco at the Riu Yucatan as it really is a good laugh. The pool was ok, quiet, but we liked that. The beach however was excellent and you could always get a bed and move it into the sun or shade as required at any time of the day. I have to say the beach is beautiful and you can walk either way for quite a distance. Watch out for the lizards on the rocks if you walk in the direction away from Playa Del Carmen. They make a really good photo opportunity. We went into Playa several times for nights out and found it really safe. Some of the bars on the side streets away from 5th Avenue have more of a Mexican vibe and you can have a drink with the locals. I never tired of the food, they have theme nights and try to keep it interesting. We went in the speciality restaurants twice. The Steak House was not to my liking but I loved the Japenese restaurant. Don't be afraid to go there if you don't like seafood as they have chicken and beef dishes. I think the only gripe I would have with the hotel is with the dress code on an evening for gentleman. They have a policy of not letting men wear 3/4 trousers / shorts. However they let people in with base ball caps. something a lot of bars / restaurants in the UK ban. And some of the women wore near on beach shorts for dinner. Apart from that some of the guests brought in their \"Bubba Cups\" that they had used all day at the pool bar and continued to drink from them through out dinner!! I agree with the previous reviewer, some of the guests used these cups for their drinks through out the day and got drunk early on at the pool bar. But that was ok as it left the nice Lobby Bar to everyone else who wanted a nice sociable drink in the evening. Do not be worried about the bad reviews, it is a very good hotel. We requested and got a room on the top floor. So if you are worried about security, request one of these rooms as no one can climb up to your balcony. Also, if you suffer mosquito bites, as I do, put your \"do not disturb\" sign on the door as you go out to dinner so you do not get the evening turnover service. (They leave your door open as they are doing this, creating an opportunity for the mosquitos to get in your room.)", "Date": "March 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mpls., MN", "Title": "\u201c2nd Year back to the Palace Mexico\u201d", "Author": "hwy.", "ReviewID": "UR99299009", "Content": "I personally cannot say enough about this place, we absolutely love it here.

Dont worry about rising early to get beds on beach - theres loads anytime. Hpwever pool can get towelled out by @ 09.00. Ignore loud Americans !! Some tend to drink all day and at pool bar, eat dinner early and crash out -dont see many at night. Entertainment fairly low key but try Riu Tequila ( also has disco). Prebook or take private taxi from Airport as transfer can be slow ( over 2 hours) Its @ one hour and 80 dollars one way in taxi. Playacar golf club. - beware if you take twlight tee times ( 120 dollars) as bar and food closed after 6.00 pm. You may get paired up with two others if there are just two of you. You will be charged for premier clubs even if you order regular at time of booking! Did not like their attitude so only played once -nice course . Coco Bongos - a must to go to even if you are 40/50 like us - great show but pay extra for VIP ticket its worth it ( 100 dollars). Exceptionally well run organisation and show. Playa Del Carmen -its more than 25 minute walk or only \u00a3 2.50 cab fare. Cabs always outside hotel. Very safe to walk around. nice restaurants.

One does not expect either service or food to be above average at an all inclusive resort. This was a surprising exception to that expectation. There are four \"gourmet\" restaurants on site plus a large central buffet style restuaruant and then 2 addtional restuaruants down by the beach. Our favorite of the four restaurants that require reservations was the Japanese (Miagi or something close to that). We were also impressed by the buffet restuaruant. Most buffets are sort of awful arrangements of overcooked food on institutional looking steam tables. This is as far from that stereotype as it could be. The beach is great. The resort has planted palm trees (30 or 40 feet tall) thickly at a distance form the shorline, and then more thinly as one approaches the waterline. So, you can choose to snooze in the chaise lounges in complete shade, filtered sunlight or for 75 yards or so next to the water, complete sun. Sand is fine and light yellow, water was comfortable (75 F ?) for February and incredibly blue/green, sun was great. The waiters and bartenders also make an effort and succeed in learning your name and remembering your drink. Pools with swim up bars are fun and lots of people used them. In the evenings, there are shows every night in the theatre. A little hoky, but still fun. Our \"junior suite\" was great, tile floor, patio, living room/area, bed room and nice bath. Booze dispensor consisting of 4 different bottles of liquor, plus a refrigerator with soda, water and beer. We played tennis every day (2 hard courts), beached, scuba dived, and shopped in Playa. We will be going back for more. One negative comment is that wireless is not complimentary in the rooms.

When we arrived on site, I strangely wondered why so many of the guest were walking around with their own thermal cups\u2026until I got to the bar and ordered a drink. The drinks are served in 4oz plastic cups, so unless you are looking for some great exercise going back and forth to the bar or hope to have one of the waiters at your beck in call, you may want to consider taking this advise. Oh and don\u2019t plan on buying one when you get there\u2026we looked all over and couldn\u2019t find one. Aside from that our stay at the RIU Palace Mexico was a 3 out of 5. As always the staff is very accommodating. I have to say, we have been many places and the servicer you receive in Mexico is immeasurable to other regions. The beach \u2013 Wonderful! Beautiful waters and white sand as far as the eye can see! The pool \u2013 So, So. On the small side. Get there early to claim your chair! They did have a swim up bar which was nice but be prepared to hear the same music CD over and over. I think I have had my fill of ABBA after about the 5th go around. The activities \u2013 If bingo or water aerobics are your thing then this is the place for you. I think they could have done a little bit more in this area. I have been to resorts where they staff is always around trying to get the guests involved in a game of volleyball or some kind of activity, not so much here. The room \u2013 If you like hard beds then you are in for a treat! I myself prefer something a bit softer then the plastic brick to lay my head on at night. Now, I have to say we did make mention of this to one of the staff members and again very accommodating\u2026.they brought a mattress pad to our room and placed it on the beds. Oh yeah, if you are expecting a king size bed plan for 2 double beds pushed together \u2013 just beware of the crack. The rooms are equipped with a mini bar and a fridge which is restocked daily with bottled water, beer and soda. The food \u2013 I have yet to really find an All-Inclusive that I walked away thinking the food was wonderful and this was no exception. The breakfast and lunch buffets are great! Enough food to feed a small country. Dinner on the other hand, let\u2019s say a 2 out of 5. With that said, we were only able to eat dinner in one the designated dinner restaurants 2 of the 6 nights we were there. Here\u2019s the thing, you have to make reservations daily. They have 2 dinner seating\u2019s, 6:30 and 8:45. In the morning (specified time period \u2013 I think it was 8:00 \u2013 10:00) you have to go grab a number and wait to be called to choose your dining experience for the evening. Now, plan on hanging out a bit as both days I think we were number 60 in line and once your number is called it\u2019s a crap shoot as to what will still be available. Both times we only had the option for the 8:45 seating, which for us was fine. The food \u2013 nothing to write home about. Oh and make sure you dress for dinner, no shorts or tank tops allowed. For me I\u2019m not sure of the logic behind this, because when I\u2019m on vacation and the last thing I want to do is put paints on. The location \u2013 Great location!!!! It\u2019s a $5.00 cab ride down to 5th Ave. Fun area for shopping, drinking or just people watching. If you are planning on doing any scuba diving you can also catch the ferry over to Cozumel there. On a side note \u2013 if using the ferry, buy a 1 way ticket. There are 2 ferry carriers and if you buy a round trip ticket you will be subject to that carries departure times. All of the RIU resorts are located in an area called Playa Car, which is a cute, gated, self contained area of hotels and residential/vacation rental properties and shopping. Resort Sharing \u2013 All of the other resorts are within walking distance and you can use their facilities with the exception of dinner. Other RIU \u2013 We went to all of them to check them out. We stayed at the RIU Palace Mexico not to be confused with the RUI Palace Riviera Maya. They are very similar in looks and set up, but I have the say the Riviera Maya looked a bit newer and nicer but not worth a huge cost difference. Evening Entertainment \u2013 I think the Palace Mexico is a little slower paced then some of the sister properties, so if you are looking for nightlife you may want to consider one of the other properties. All in all we loved our vacation and would consider staying again but would also research the other available options in the Playa Car region.", "Date": "February 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kingsville, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Vacation!\u201d", "Author": "buckley96", "ReviewID": "UR98138012", "Content": "Had a wonderful time and would go back to any of the Riu's in this area.

We loved it!! We got through the airport/customs and immigration at the airport in probably an hour. Our shuttle service, Lomas Travel was incredible. We found the rep right away because of the teal shirt and white pants. He took our bags and got us right over to our shuttle and was incredibly polite and helpful. The drive from Cancun to Playa was about 45 minutes, but we met some nice people that rode in our shuttle with us, so it made the time pass.....oh, not to mention the Corona's we drank. :-) Checking in was a breeze. We got our key and they helped us up to our room. Room was very, very clean and I even made it a point to look around in cracks and crevices just to see with my own eyes. I even felt comfortable laying on the comforter on the bed and I get grossed out about those at hotels. Every day at different parts of the day they were always cleaning...scrubbing floors, painting the railing outside on the courtyard, cutting the grass, trimming bushes....everything was immaculate. Yes, there is a musty smell, but that's EVERYWHERE in Mexico, it's not just this hotel. If you can't stand it then Mexico isn't for you. The hotel was huge, courtyard beautiful, beaches very well cared for and gorgeous. Food was great too. Buffets were awesome with a wide variety to choose from. You will never go hungry here. The only angst was the lack of \"snacky\" type food. They had chips/cheese dip at the pool bar, but I agree, the cheese was kind of gross. My husband and I would recommend taking snacks to the room with you....chips, crackers...something like that for in between meal times. Making reservations at the restaurants was not difficult at all, so I totally disagree with the reviews saying it is. We were generally up around 7:30 everyday, so we'd take our time, shower, throw on our suits/cover ups and head down to breakfast. One day we had to wait about 10 minutes to get reservations, but we got them in the sushi res. where we requested and actually ate there twice that week. We also ate at El Patio and never had any issues getting reservations. It's not a mad dash to get down there, but if you wait til 10:30 then no, you probably won't get your reservation, but it doesn't hurt to ask. I can't say enough good about some of the staff. We absolutely loved Santoya and Raul at the hotel and Carlos from Lomas Travel. But, all in all, everyone was very polite and extremely helpful. They actually seem like they enjoy what they're doing!! We also met some great couples that we partied with one night. Lots of people escaping the cold winter. Weather was awesome.....80-85 and sunny every day. It rained one day, all day, so we improvised and went to 5th Ave (downtown) all day. We had a great time!! Totally safe....no problems with people or the taxi's or anything. Of course we loved the drinks at the hotel because you can get anything you want....beer, margs, martinis, dacquiris....you name it. There were 2 weddings while we were there....one was under the gazebo in the courtyard because of the rain and the other was on the beach.......BEAUTIFUL to watch and be part of. We did two excursions. One was a catamarane that took us to a beach where we at steak/lobster on the beach in the evening. It was incredible and romantic. The other was jet skis/snorkeling. The tour guide was awesome and we rode the jet skis what seemed forever, so you got your money's worth. We snorkeled in two different places. Loved it! The only issue we had was getting a sick stomach the second to last day we were there and I think it's because of the water.....not sure. We did not drink the tap water, but we brushed our teeth with it, they mix it in drinks and probably rinse their lettuce, veggies and fruit with it. However, we are not positive on that. Other than that, the trip was incredible, we plan on going back again and staying at RIU Palace Mexico. Oh, one other thing....we were considerign taking our boys.....9 and 13, but this hotel is more for adults, not much to do for kids, so I wouldn't recommend kids go. Our boys would have been bored if we wouldn't have done excursions and that can get pricey.

The transfer to the resort from the Cancun airport took about an hour but we had a very informational driver and found interesting things to see or discuss along the way. Just relax - the time will pass. Check-in went smoothly. We were scheduled to receive a \"run of the house\" room but I had emailed the resort a week prior to arriving to ask if we could use our 500 Riu points for an upgrade & asked again upon arrival. They granted us an upgrade being placed on the main level w/ a garden view right across from the large fountains. Our Junior Suite was very nice. I have seen mentioned that the furniture looks a little worn but not in our room. The beds are pushed together but that makes for one huge bed and we didn't mind at all. Please note there is a sticker on the bathroom mirror not to drink the water in your room as is the case in many Mexican resorts. No problem - the room is stocked each day w/ plenty of bottled water in both large & small bottles. On another note - have a problem w/ a short supply of towels etc... - just call housekeeping and the towels will arrive in as long as it took them to come to your room. The biggest asset is the beach! It is wonderful compared to others we have visited. You can walk as far as the eye can see and the water is very play-full. The lounge area is very large w/ plenty of lounge chairs. One little draw-back, there are no tables in the lounge area but were told to just bring the small white tables down from the pool areas. I think they take them back up at night to keep them from blowing away. The pools were a little smaller than the other Riu's we have visited being the Riu Vallarta, in PV & the Riu Montego Bay in Jamaica but were very nice & adequate. We spend very little time @ the pools because the beach was perfect. The food in the buffet - what can we say - it was plentiful, a large variety, nicely presented & way too yummy! Your choices are endless. I have read that it gets tiresome but pick something different each day or stick w/ your stand-bys, can't go wrong. One note, if you have a large group at the evening buffet - there are large tables in the back of the buffet and they will gladly move or combine tables. We only ate at one specialty restaurant but ate there twice. It was the steak house and the best was the Baked Alaska! Ordered it both evenings. Being from Nebraska - we can't judge the beef because no - one can beat our own Nebraska beef on the grill. It was good though. The other entrees were served family style and were very tasty. Concerning making reservations for the specialty restaurant - we have early risers so it was not a problem and we have experienced different methods of making reservations and none are perfect or totally convenient for everyone. We had visited a resort prior that had the option to make reservations 3 days in advance. What we found in that case was the first 3 days - they were totally booked so with that example we gladly accept the method at the Riu's. The service - we have been to 25 different 4 star resorts in as many years. The service was a step-up from any others we have visited. They will do anything to please you. No others words but excellent! The drinks were typical Mexican or tropical varieties but they will give you what ever you desire. They offer wine at each meal. We drank alot of \"dirty monkeys & mud slides\" but often opted for plain ole whiskey & water etc.... Again, service is outstanding - they are back to serve you again before you know it. As far as noise level generated by entertainment. Yes, you may hear it until 11pm but who goes to bed before then anyway and if you shut your doors - you will receive a quiet sleep. The entertainment was typical Mexican resort variety. We were there for the SuperBowl and felt very pampered to watch it in the open terrace area outside of the big projection screen theatre when we would have been bundled in blankets at home.

We were in our rooms within 10 minutes of arriving. Sleeping arrangements with a family are odd. There are two small double beds pushed together. It was impossible for all four of us to sleep in them so one of my children had to sleep on the small, non-pull out sofa. The rooms were musty smelling but this is to be expected with most Caribbean rooms. Our safe worked and we kept everything in there. We also kept our patio door locked as we were on the main level. Don't take any chances with your valuables. Be smart. Our room cleaning service was great and our rooms were very clean and turned down every night. There are two large pools. They are kept very cold but this is nice for a refreshing dip when you are sweating your butt off!!! One pool is quite deep so it didn't work well for us with the kids. We had to use the part of the pool that is right in front of the swim up bar. This is the best height for my kids (6 & 7). The kids pool is a bit of a joke. It's a super tiny wading pool. Good for toddlers, I guess, but I never saw anyone in it... ever! The kids club is small but my kids loved it. They played ping pong in the shade and loved the people working there. It was good for them to get into the shade and have a change of pace every once and a while. I felt very comfortable leaving them there. Now the food. I really enjoyed the food and we are very PICKY resort food eaters. We will not go to Cuba or the DR because of the food. If you love sushi, the Japanese restaurant is amazing!!!! We went back twice. The Steak House was quite good too. They do not have kid options at the restaurants (like chicken fingers and fries) so most people with children ate at the buffet. My kids are flexible eaters so we did fine. Making reservations is very annoying!!! You've got to be there early every day to make your reservation for that night and it's a bit of a mad dash to try and get a good number if you want a 6:30 reservation. It's a very small resort and everything is walking distance. I prefer small resorts. I do not like waiting for busses and trains to take me to dinner. The size was lovely but that also means that you will hear everything that happens at night at the main stage. The air conditioning will drown out the noise though. I was happy for the AC as my kids were in bed when the music started up. The service was wonderful! I was very pleased with the people who knew my kids and always patted them on the head. The kids loved it. And the servers always remembered our drink orders. A $5 at the beginning of the day will help you with that!!! My Spa experience \"to start\" off was terrible. I had to wait for 15 minutes only to find out that they couldn't find my massage therapist. Then this man who was sweeping the floors said he would massage me. I didn't even believe that he was a massage therapist so I rebooked for the next day. They next day I also waited a long while and when I finally got my massage it was only 40 minutes even though I paid for 50. Here is the good part. They gave me a free massage the next day and it was lovely. She even threw in an extra 10 minutes. They were very apologetic and I went away pleased. Down Town is only a $5 taxi cab drive. Well worth it! We enjoyed our day trip there. And the kids loved watching me barter. Do not be afraid to ask for a lower price. Overall, we enjoyed this resort.

The Steak House was also very good. The main restaurant was a buffet all week. They had many similar selections all week and had a speciality meal each night. It was okay, but nothing to write home about. The beach was ourstanding. Plenty of area to relax in the sun, or if you prefer, you could relax in the shade of the palm trees. We had to drag the lounge chairs to our location each day. They had a small beach bar, but you had to walk halfway back to the hotel to get to it. They could have put it a little closer to the beach. The pool was good. Plenty of room, but it was difficult to find a chair in the afternoon. This was the second Riu we stayed at (Montego Bay, Jamaica). It seemed like the other Riu had more planned activities for guests than this one. We even checked out the Riu Yucatan next door and it seemed like they had more things going on there. If you have small children, try another Riu. Not much to do there for kids. All-in-all, it was a pretty good stay. When people say don't drink the water in Mexico, they mean it!!!

We arrived and were upgraded to a two story jacuzzi suite even though we weren't on our honeymoon - what a great surprise! Check-in took maybe ten minutes and everything we needed was explained to us at this time. Our room was super clean, as were the grounds and everything else. The bed was the biggest king we'd ever slept in. The hallways are open so the only places that are air conditioned are the room, lobby and restaurants. We had a \"damp\" smell in our room but it only seemed to appear when we'd be gone all day and returned. I always wore shoes in the room because the floors always seemed to feel wet but we had the same experience in Cozumel as well. The food was pretty good for an all-inclusive. We ate at Krystal (fusion) and it was decent but nothing over-the-top. The other restaurant we ate at was Miyagi which was also decent - our waiter brought us extra sushi without us even asking. I was surprised by the small size of these restaurants. We ended up in the high 30's in the reservation line and had no problem getting into the restaurants we wanted (the 6:30 times were full but we wanted the 8:45 anyways). The buffet had a large selection for dinner and breakfast. We ate lunch by the beach at the buffet there - it was OK. We got tired of the food the last couple days. I ate lots of pineapple instead of the other junk food but ended up with an upset stomach. There was just so much fresh fruit I couldn't seem to stop myself... We loved the beach and had no trouble finding a good spot under the palm trees. We'd usually move to the pool area after lunch and again, no problems finding a good spot. At the beach, trays of drinks were brought around and there was waiter service at the pool. We did go to the Riviera Maya Palace one afternoon - the pool is nicer there but it was really crowded. It was partly cloudy a few days and rained a few times throughout the trip but we were never really bored. The piano lounge in the lobby was great and the drinks seemed to be the best there. The beach bar drinks seemed to be pretty weak and so did the alcohol in the rooms. One last note - the only place for wi-fi is in the lobby/courtyard or there were laptops you could pay to use.

Had a good holiday (although the weather was decidedly iffy for Feb) and we would definitely return to the hotel. Lobby: The lobby is a formal area, and for me lacked any atmosphere. The bell boy service was excellent and speedy both on arrival and departure from the hotel. The reception staff were distinctly average and not particularly friendly. The lobby is a vast area with a large decorative stone staircase at each end leading to the rooms. There's also a shop (extortionate!) and a lovely little chapel. There's also a lobby bar that wasn't particularly well used. The lobby tended to be heavily used by people with laptops taking advantage of the free wifi service. Bedrooms: Our bedroom was located at the beach end of the hotel which suited us perfectly. We were on the top floor and overlooked some trees and the tennis courts of the Riu Yucatan. It was a quiet location and had the sun most of the day. Being picky, the balcony was very small in comparison to most and it was only just about big enough to seat two. The room itself was very spacious and despite lots of reviews stating rooms were tired, for me the condition was very good. The mini bar was well stocked and the optics had premium brands including Smirnoff, Jose Cuervo and Bacardi. A coffee maker was provided with two mugs and coffee but no spoons, sugar or milk!!! The wardrobe was massive with tons of hangers. The bathroom was also spacious with lots of towels, and shampoo/conditioner, shower gel and body lotion all provided and replenished every day. When we arrived, the air con wasn't working but this was immediately fixed as soon as we mentioned it. One thing we couldn't fault all holiday was the cleanliness. The room was absolutely spotless all week as was the rest of the hotel. Pool: There is one small pool area (split into two) with loungers and a pool bar. We spent most of our time at the beach but used to stop at the pool bar for a drink on the way back to the room. The side of the pool with the bar is quite lively, the other side is much quieter so something for everyone. There seemed to be loungers available most of the time. Beach: The beach is lovely and again the loungers were plentiful. We used to head to the beach at about 9 am and often found we were one of the first. The beach does get busy but never felt crammed unlike some of the other hotels nearby. One thing to note is that the only shade was under the palm trees at the back of the beach. There's a beach bar and also lounger service (a selection of drinks brought around) which was great. The water sports were also good. Food: Breakfast for me in the main restaurant was the best of all the meals. Lunch was ok although we found that both beach restaurants (next door to each other) had different things so we ended up going back and forth between the two to get what we wanted. The main restaurant in the evening had a good selection of foods for all tastes. We tried two of the speciality restaurants \u2013 the steakhouse and Krystal. Both were nice but Krystal was the better by far \u2013 we went twice! I should also mention the fact that there's free room service available. Entertainment: This was very low key which suited us. Most nights there was the house band followed by a dance show. The local Mayan show being the one to watch. We had drinks most nights out in the courtyard and there were stalls to browse several nights too. This is a quiet low key hotel, so if you are looking for lively entertainment then just pop across the road to the Tequila. I travelled with my Mum and the Riu Palace Mexico suited us perfectly. I'd highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a low key week in a very nice and civilised hotel.

The food and service at this resort is really top notch so to find complaints there it is very difficult. About the only thing I could suggest that I have found at other resorts that I liked was having more snacks for lounging around the pool. The only thing available is nacho chips with the warm cheese. I might elaborate on that area and add a table with fresh salsa and guacamole and their chili and even a popcorn machine. My husband went over to the sports bar at the Riu Tequila to watch the NFL playoff games and they had some snacks in the refrigerator to help yourself and again just the boring nacho chips with the yucky cheese sauce. I was very surprised by the service on the beach, yes on the beach! The beach area is very large and as a guest of the Riu Palace you got drink service down there as well.

The cheese sauce for the nachos is the only thing I'd say is not good. Go figure! Room great, but musty smelling. I've been going to Mex for 30 years and u just have to come prepared with air fresheners. I'm 5\"2\" and could just barely reach the locks on the patio doors. Master switch at entry turns lights/TV all off or on(didn't realize this at first and thought I had lost power LOL!), plus a bar to prevent entry when inside. Ceiling fan switch by bed. Had rm. 0034, faced the Yucatan,( 00 rooms are ground level) large patio with large chairs that would recline and see thru iron railings, @12 feet of grass then 7 ft. hedge,fence and trees. on the other side of fence was walkway/ cart path to Yucatan beach access for the RT people. Didn'T hear any noise in room when doors were shut.. Lots of birds singing and a great place to have coffee in the am. in my bathrobe cuz no one could see me thru the hedge.Saw those funny squirrel/rabbit things- they are harmless. Couldn't do that if I faced the courtyard and had a patio with iron rails. (@ half of courtyard view rms. have see-thru iron rails. The rest are solid walls) Great shower, shower head was adjustable on a bar to go higher if needed, kinda slim tub though.2 extra pillows and 2 thick fluffy blankets in closet, they came in handy. Fridge was cold, even icy.Ltr. of water in bathroom for making coffee and brushing teeth ( Don't use tap water!) and plenty more in fridge. Air only works when patio doors are closed and floors can get slippery if u leave them open from humidity. A few mosquitoes, just keep screen doors closed.I cannot say enough @ the staff and maid service! I left $2 in fridge and $2 for maids everyday and put out \"make up room\" sign and it was done right after I went out! The towel animals they left put disney world one's to shame. They put roses in my room and I got a note from management the3rd day saying to call if I needed anything with a PDC shot glass! Oh ya-there is a pull out rack on patio to hang up wet suits etc...too. I only ate at the buffets and cant believe people say there is no selection. Breakfast had make ur own bloodys and mimosas, 7 smoothies, Eggs ANYWAY U WANT THEM cappuccino's etc..Just look around the place before u decide want u want.Service was always great.If u eat at the beach buffet for lunch, check out both restaurants, cuz they have burgers,dogs,ice cream on 1 side and pasta, pizza on other.The fish was best at dinner, I could go on and on! Buffet by lobby is non smoking except on patio. Beach is great and big now, always got a pool chair too. Beach service from beach bar a plus.All bar service was fast, no waiting. I don't stay up too late, but the live band in court yard was good and I did manage to stay up for the Michael Jackson show. Service was great out there too. I'm in the restaurant business and their system for getting u drinks fast is super. Some guys stay out by the tables and take ur order and pass it to drink runners. Great system RUI! I was solo and wouldn't recommend for singles or small kids. People dress up a little more here which I liked, but its more laid back. You can always go to the other RIU;S for a livelier atmosphere or may be it was the time of year. The day it rained they had one of the \"twilight\" movies in the theatre to keep people entertained and they showed the NFL games there on Sunday too. Inside theatre is non smoking and I don't know if the had drink service for that. I called front desk and they told me the games would be also be on at the RPM bar and at the RT bar. The front desk people were the best of any where I've ever stayed.

We really enjoy the RPM this is our sixth return stay in the last 9 years. We stopped going to Playacar area for a couple of years due to the beach, but now the beach has been restored. I dont always feel the need to write a review however this trip was really great. The whole RIU complex was at or near full occupancy. I suggest joining RIU Class. The perks are great not only do get points for stays you also get early check-in, check-out and upgrades. We checked in at 1PM, had paid for a regular courtyard jr. suite but were upgraded to superior ocean front jr. suite without even asking. This was a considerable cost savings. We enjoyed the whole RIU complex. The service at the both the RPM and RPRM was great, from the bartenders to the waiters. I cant say the same for the RIU Yucatan, it was way too crowded. Guests of the RIU Yucatan kept attempting to get bar service from the RPM. The RPM beach bartender was polite telling them he could not serve them and they would need to return to the RIU Yucatan. The guests from the RIU Yucatan all had the same issues, slow service, beer was warm, mixed drinks and sodas had very little ice at the RIU Yucatan. I went over to try the beer later and it was warm, yuck. Before I left home the week prior I checked all the weather web sites and I was concerned as it looked like it would be cold and rainy. It was not cold at all at night, unless low 70's is considered cold. The weather was great, it never rained, highs in the upper 80's to low 90's. We didn\u2019t get any bug bites either. I do agree with other reviews that the RPM is showing it's age but that is understandable considering the climate and the constant guest turnover. I don\u2019t see any benefit in staying at the RPRM versus RPM as you have full access to the RPRM and the RPM is less expensive than the RPRM. The RPM is older but the pool/ beach area has more of a palm forest tropical feel to it. Yes the pool is larger at the RPRM. The food was excellent at the RPM. One night the buffet had lobster. I must have had five, umm good. The beach is great all along Playacar and you can actually enjoy swimming in the sea compared to the Cancun hotel zone.

The food was very good, although I will never understand why resorts in Mexico don't serve non-dairy creamer.

The room had a flat screen TV, and FOX News. Nice! I wished the room had easy chairs with ottomans instead of a soft couch and cocktail table, though. When we arrived on the 12th, the waves were HUGE, no doubt a result of the weather system affecting the East Coast of the states. By the end of the week, the weather was perfect, and the ocean was warm and fun. My only complaint is that there is no way to get away from the noise of the evening entertainment, but, thankfully, it ends about 11:00. This resort doesn't have loud entertainment at the pool during the day, which was fine with us, so we could enjoy the sound of the waves from our chairs on the beach. The front desk was helpful, and all of the staff is extremely hard-working. Tips were appreciated, but I never felt that they were expected. My only suggestions would be to bring your own Coffee Mate, and see if your cell phone can make international calls. I wanted to call Fun Jet and Air Tran, but it was impossilbe to make a long distance call to an 800 # in the states from our room. The thing that separates this resort from some in Riviera Maya is that one can walk the beach for miles in either direction. One can also walk on a safe city street (as well as along the beach) and end up in Playa del Carmen. It was fun to walk past a park near Playa del Carmen with 5 small Mayan ruins.

The trip started out with beautiful weather till mid week, which is poured all day,but what can you do, its mother nature. Hotel reception/front desk staff was excellent and very helpful. Got us a great room overlooking the courtyards, even though we were supposed to get a basic boring view room. It had a great private balcony, where I spent many mornings in the sun waiting for my husband to wake up. Rooms-average to above average. The beds were not so bad, I was expecting much worse. The bathroom was in great shape too, loved the little separate shower area and separate toliet area. Cleaning people did a wonderful job cleaning our room everyday, giving us extra towels, extra water and beer in the fridge as well. I also asked for Pepsi Light and they brought up bottles of that as well. As far as the smell everyone talks about,yes there is a smell, but I smelled it right when you get off the plane in Cancun. Its a tropical climate, what do you expect, BUT, I must say, I did have to WASH everything when we returned, even the clothes I didn't wear, and even lysoled and aired out the suitcases because I guess you really don't notice the smell until you get home. We had a small incident with our bathroom toliet twice, smelling of sewer water and immediatley had a man upstairs fixing the issue. Room 2154 if anyone is interested. Food-I am extremly fussy when it comes to food. Here, I never had a problem of finding something to eat. Breakfast in the buffet was my favorite time of the day. Great variety of foods to pick from always, breakfast ,lunch and dinner. We only tried one specialty restaurant. El Patio Steakhouse. It was alright, middle of the road, and the best thing is, you can always go back to the buffet for more afterwards. Which we did of course haha. Beach- GORGEOUS. More than enough room for lounging, plenty of shade and sun, and beautiful waters of course. When we were there the water was very choppy, so alot of the water activities we were unable to do. Pools-I enjoyed the pool areas. They weren't huge, but I felt the perfect size and a great atmosphere. More than enough room to sit and relax, and the water wasn't as cold as people made it out to be. I jumped right in a bunch of times ( sober and drunk ) and it felt the same both times. Service-Cannot top it. The best we have ever been treated on any of our vacations. Extremely friendly, very helpful, always serving with a smile. Pool bartenders were our favs. Maybe its because they made a mean Long Island Ice Tea, but we definatley spent the most time at this bar. All of the staff in the entire resort made our trip that much more enjoyable. Cleanliness-Sparkling, always someone cleaning something. No matter what time of day or what direction you looked everything was in tip top shape. My husband and I being total neat freaks couldn't help but notice this. It was wonderful to see them keeping this resort in such good shape. We took the Ferry to Cozumel one day. Expensive if you ask me, but it is something we both wanted to check out. Here we went snorkeling, great waters to snorkel in. Enjoyed some chips and guac and watched some football at a sports bar and then took the ferry home later in the day. We also went to Tulum one day, but probably picked the worst day for that, as it poured on us pretty much the entire time. Beaches looked pretty through the rain drops, and the ruins were amazing, but after awhile, we just couldn't enjoy being in the rain, so we headed back to our resort on the collectivo. We went into downtown Playa Del Carmen one night ( we walked from our hotel ) about a half hour walk and much needed after all the eating you do at the resort. Loved the dt area. We had a great time. Met up with a friend and ate at Los Carbonitos, which was so good. Also did some betting at Tequila Barrel. I thought it was awesome how they had sports betting. Ended up at a shotty little place called the Beer Bucket, but we like that laid back, nothing fancy bar. Finally-going back to the resort, I really thought the entertainment staff did a great job. Very funny, very friendly, we couldnt stop laughing at one of the shows one night, I think it was the MR RIU contest, but it was too funny. We also shot the air riffles one day and that was neat too. All in all, I would definatley tell all my friends and family to stay here. We would even come back again ourselves. Its a beautiful, well maintained, clean property with outstanding service.

There were always lots of chez- lounges and lots of shady areas under palm trees on the beach. The ala-carte restaurants were OK but we aren't huge fan of these restaurants. We prefer the buffet restaurants. There's very little entertainment by the entertainment team on the beach. No dancing, no music, no sea-aerobics. The stretching at 10 am was very amateurish and on one day the person who was supposed to lead didn't show up. The fitness room is small but they have a variety of equipment. With these changes this resort would have been perfect for us: 1. Better tasting coffee, espresso, capuchino 2. A master of ceremony to encourage the vacationers to dance in the plaza in the evenings. Bring in a better band that is more suited to dancing. 3. Offer daily dancing lessons and dancing on the beach to taped music. 4. Move the evening kids entertainment program from the indoor theater stage to another location in the resort. The music on stage is too loud and it interferes with the guests who are sitting in the plaza cafe. It's too annoying. 5. It would be great to have a non-smoking section on the beach.

I was frankly diasappointed in the overall experience. The good stuff: the grounds are gorgeous - well maintained, quite impressive. The beach is awesome (as would be expected around Playa del Carmen), and there is an abundance of beach chairs. Booze is all premium brands, well poured. Staff are friendly enough, and quite responsive to requests. The so-so stuff: Food is only slightly better than the average all-inclusive, tending towards bland flavours that won't offend. The selection of restaurants is also quite limited and the seating capacity of each is small, so it is very hard to get a table and one must line up at 8:00 on the morning of to get a reservation. Children's club is small, with very limited facilities. Gym was also small, but functional. The bad: The rooms. Not all the the rooms, mind you, but some of them. I may be naive, but in my view a five star hotel there should be no \"bad\" rooms. We are paying enough that each room should be quite nice. Well, the rooms are, in terms of furnishings, nice enough - if a bit dated. The rooms locations, however, are another thing altogether. The first room we were given had a quite deluxe view - we were staring at a wall some 20 feet away and listening to evening arguments among staff at the hotel next door. We asked, nicely enough, for a different room, and they quite graciously accommodated us by giving us a room with a another great view, this time of a rooftop. Oddly enough, we asked for yet another different room. We were offered a \"partial view\" room, which we took. What I (and my wife) failed to realize was that the room was on top of the theatre and at the end of the plaza closest to the main lobby. We were subjected to very loud music from the theatre each night (and got to hear much of it twice, thanks to the doppler effect) until 11:30 or so. Not usually a problem, but with two small children this was a real issue. Now you might say that we brought this upon ourselves with our room switches, and that would be partially true, but it is still the case that in a supposedly five star hotel, I expect better than this. There should not be rooms that have these issues.

We booked our trip \"a la carte\" with separate air, transfers and hotel, which we found couldn't be beat as a package deal on any of my best travel websites. This was my first trip to the Mayan Riviera side of Mexico and I really enjoyed the warm ocean and moderate climate. I will itemize the different areas for quick reference: Overall Impression of Hotel: Nestled in the hotel zone, this hotel is quite spectacular from the front entrance to the resort and the Christmas lights added a nice festive touch. Upon entry into the lobby, a distinct musty odor was detected. Check in was fast and efficient. There is more of a crackdown on the underaged members of our group with regard to legal age for drinking. It's 18 in Mexico and the staff asked for passport ID before assigning wristbands. We never found this to be the case when visiting other destinations. Not that drinking is an issue for any of our teens, but they felt as young men, they were lumped in with the younger children. The location was convenient - about a half hour walk into Playa del Carmen. If you stroll the ruins along the way, maybe closer to an hour. A $5 US cab ride will also suffice. The traveller's advisory regarding US currency in Mexico shouldn't be taken too seriously. I dealt in US funds to tip at the resort and when bartering for goods and never actually touched a peso the whole trip. Canadian money is not well received. Getting back to the overall impression of the resort. Impressive in photos, but up close, a little tired and in need of some upgrades (ie lobby furniture and room furniture). Restaurants: Can't complain about this resort. Food is plentiful and fresh and nicely displayed. The buffet always had something for every taste. The hotel was at about 80% occupancy and there was never a shortage of tables or sittings at any of the a la cartes. A la cartes can be booked each morning. We ate at the steakhouse, japanese and the french restaurant. All meals were served fast and efficiently and the waiter service was always good. We tipped, but no need, as you likely won't find any difference in your level of service. The dress code is enforced, although the 17 year olds got away with shorts and shirts, the men must wear long pants (jeans are OK). Room service was ordered frequently by the teens and they reported that the food was good. Rooms: We had three junior suites among us. They placed us in close proximity with one another. Our first room had a blocked toilet, which flooded the room. Maintenance was sent up right away to fix it, but we waited a while for the flood to be tended to. The toilet flooded again the next day and I spent the better part of the day trying to get it fixed (properly) and with no success, I insisted on a new room, which I received after being told several times, there were no vacant rooms. This was my only complaint for the whole 9 days that we stayed. Toilet blocks happen, but I would have liked to have been treated like I wasn't the problem. Rooms are spacious and comfortable, although a little tired looking. Pillows were nice, beds a little hard, slight musty smell and bathrooms were humid. We couldn't reuse towels because they never dried out. Don't leave clothes in the bathroom, they'll get damp. Free safe, bar fridge stocked daily and maid service sufficient. A bit of noise early in the mornings as families headed down to breakfast, but otherwise quiet. Overall, this was a quiet hotel. Pool, Gym & Activities: The pool was on the cool side for part of the stay. I asked about this and I think it's solar heated, so the first few days were on the cool side. Once the weather warmed up, so did the pools. The hot tub wasn't (hot, that is - same temperature as the pool), so we didn't use it. Lots of lounge chairs with no need to \"reserve\" a spot with your towel in the morning. Swim up bar always seemed to be in the shade. Waiter service on the pool deck was good. Activity leaders like to invite guests to join in. Lots of daily activities to join in. The boys really enjoyed the volleyball and games were going on most of the day. Gym was adequate and staff on hand if you had any questions. Towels & water provided. Bars & Entertainment: Service was good at any of the bars we used, We liked the lobby bar best. The evening activies and entertainment were good, although we never found that the theater filled up. A different show every night, a casino night with auction and courtyard live bands played on several nights. You have privileges at the other Riu hotels in the area if you desire more lively evenings. Our hotel was on the quiet side, which was fine for us. Beach & Grounds: Gorgeous. Tons of lounge chairs available. Shade under palm trees was easy to find. Beach is easily swimable and snorkeling could be done right out front of the hotel. Beach vendors not too bothersome, just a few jewellery and sunglass sales people. Some hammocks available. Easy walk along the beach to the town. Watch for the cute little agoutis running around (like tailless large squirrels). Spa: Didn't use it - thought the services were too expensive compared to what you can get in the town. Tip: Don't brush your teeth with the room water. One person in our group came home with an e coli like illness and since we didn't eat off the resort, this is what could have caused it.

And the hotel is showing some age in some spot. It is was easily overcome for us by the staff's exceptional service and friendliness. The service was wonderful. Lots of smiles and \"hola senoir's.\" The food being that this is an \"all-inclusive\" was delicious and plentiful. The drinks were good and beer at this hotel is only Dos Equis light or dark. The wine is just average. The bathroom's are kept clean by maid service and could use a much needed appearance makeover. Hotel guests are allowed to visit the other RIU's in the Playacar. We did venture to the RUI Tequila across the street to their friendly bars and to watch a couple of their shows. At the RIU Palace we watched bands and danced nightly outdoors.

Every year around this time we take a gals vacation, just to catch up, chill out and generally recharge our batteries. I had visited the Palace several years ago, and hoped it would live up to my fond memories, as I had \"talked it up\" to my friend. I am glad to say that it lived up to both my fond memories and my expectations of a superior hotel. I won't rehash all the details as others have provided great, detailed reviews, but rather focus on a few key points. The Beach: The beach is lovely, long and very wide, and as most visitors know, was enlarged after the coastline suffered erosion from numerous storms and hurricanes. Although the hotel appeared to be at capacity, there really was no difficulty finding chairs, particularly if you arrived on the beach before 11:00 a.m. We didn't see a lot of beach waiter service early in the week, however, this seemed to pick up noticeably after a couple of days. It's lovely to be completely lazy, and have a waiter arrive with a large tray of drinks to choose from so I certainly took advantage of this service. Waiter service was also available poolside, and of course there is a bar on the beach and at the pool. Food: I don't understand how anyone can complain about the food. Sure there are things that I found to be more to my liking than others, but when wouldn't that be the case? On the whole the food in the buffet is excellent - very tasty, and fresh with a huge variety of items to suit all tastes. There must be more than a dozen salads to choose from on any given night, so whether you are a vegetarian or meat eater, you will find many delicious offerings. On a typical evening, for example, I found roast leg of lamb, roast chicken, steak, a pasta station, a pizza station (with a chef that you can watch making the pizzas) seafood, at least 10 vegetables dishes, breads, soups, appetizers, cheeses, cold meats, salads galore, and a dessert table. I had champagne with my dinner every evening (at no extra charge). I should add here that I have a bit of a sensitive stomach, and never once during my stay did I ever experience any stomach upset. Also, the wait staff is welcoming, professional, pleasant and efficient. General Comments/Other: As we were at the resort to decompress a bit, I admit we didn't wander to far from the resort, so I can't comment on any tours, excursions, etc., (having done several on previous trips to the area). One afternoon I opted for a massage on the beach, the hotel spa having established a small shaded hut for this service on the beach. I had a deep tissue massage to get rid of some knots in my shoulders and neck area, and the price was only $50 for 50 minutes. (a promotional price). Jos\u00e9, my masseur was very professional, and gave me one of the best messages I have ever had. As I left the hut, he even offered to work on my neck the following day (for free) should there be any lingering stiffness. That's great service. A few words on the location of the hotel. I think it is extremely well located, being in a safe gated residential area called Playacar. You have the benefit of being in a quiet location, (surrounded by other hotels and upscale residences) but only a $5 cab ride away from the restaurants, clubs and shopping of Playa del Carmen - in my view, the best of both worlds. For my money the Riu Palace Mexico offers great value, service, and a beautiful ocation and beach, and I would heartily recommend it to family and friends.

There are also some large chain stores like Mega (from Mexico), Wal-Mart and Sam\u2019s Club. I personally like to shop and eat were the locals go. The beach and the grounds at the hotel were great.

Some reviews on this page are for that hotel and not this one. This resort houses 6 Riu hotels, which if you are a Palace Guest you are able to use the facilities of all 6 except for evening meal which must be taken at your own hotel. 2 of the others have sports bars, we wanted peace and quiet so were glad we stayed here. We only visited one of the other 6, the other Palace a short walk along the beach that was newer than this hotel. Laid out in a very similar way but with a larger pool that was busier than ours so again, liking the quiet life we felt we had chosen wisely. All Inclusive here means All Inclusive - towels for the beach, minibar in the room, room service, trial scuba session - in fact the only things that were chargeable were laundry, watersports and spa treatments. The hotel is situated right on the beach and there are ample bars with one on the beach serving all drinks including an extensive list of cocktails made freshly for you - it would have been rude not to work our way through the list! Beautiful beach, what else would you expect on this coastline? Ample sunloungers, no problem getting loungers at any time of day. Guests took bread from the restaurant to feed the fish who would happily swim around you in the clear waters to feed. Plenty of watersports on the beach for those looking for an active holiday. Lovely pool, all one depth, shaped like a flower, split into two sides, a lively side with activities and the swim up bar and a quiet side, with very regular waiter service for drinks to your sunlounger or in the pool. Small library by the poolside stocked with books left by fellow travellers so you can swap your holiday book for another read. Again, ample sun loungers, more comfortable by the pool than the beach as the padded cushions were super. There are 6 restaurants, you can take your evening meal in any but need to book if you want to use any of them other than the main one. Other than the main restaurant which serves all cuisines, the restaurants are themed. We tried the Steakhouse and were very disappointed, set meal, choice of starters but no matter what you ordered every couple was brought one of each and as one was seafood and one had cheese added our individual dietry requirements meant we had to pick at one. Main dish had poor quality meat and the dessert looked inedible, we walked out after the main and ate a proper meal in the main restaurant. This is the only reason the hotel has a 4 and not a 5 from us as this put us off trying the other themed restaurants and we ate solely in the main, which was excellent but became a little samey and when you choose a hotel with 6 you expect to be able to choose each evening. Otherwise, cant really find fault here. Breakfast in the main restaurant was exceptional, always at the main entrance open bottles of champagne on ice next to fresh orange, cherries and champagne flutes for you to make your own Bucks Fizz to start the day. Fresh omlettes made for you and a range of foods from around the world second to none. Again, superb at lunch and in the evening, only small downside was that they only serve wine, light beer (lager) and soft drinks so if you want a cocktail or dark beer take it in with you from the piano bar as you walk down. Rooms are excellent, clean and large (split level with a lounge and sofa) with a minibar and 4 optics containing full bottles of vodka, tequila, brandy and bacardi. Beds are huge - 8ft wide, satelitte tv with european channels. We didnt take any trips so cant comment on them, it was far too lovely here to spend days out elsewhere not enjoying the lovely surroundings. We are due to marry in the Carribean in March and saw 2 weddings whilst we were here, definately a nice wedding location so if you are looking at tying the knot abroad its worth thinking about here as a venue.

It is truly paradise there. Food-we ate at all the restaurants (except for the Japanese sushi) and I have to say variety wise, Don Julian buffet is the best. The reservations were never full at the others though. The Brazilian restaurant we ate at twice, make sure you get all you want of a certain meat the first time, they do not come back around once you get a piece like they do in traditional brazilian steakhouses. The Fusion restaurant is very much noveau cuisine so if you don't like that, I wouldn't recommend that. My boys laughed at the food there and ended up ordering room service. Keep in mind, the room service menu is very limited though. A club sandwich in Mexico is not a club sandwich with turkey bacon etc. The steakhouse was ok, we ended up going into Playa and eating dinner on our last night, we were pretty sick of the food. There is enormous variety and they try and cater to all cultures. It is a very cosmopolitan group there. Things I wish I would have known: Having teenage boys-I wish someone would have mentioned the topless sunbathers. My younger son was mortified, the other one intrigued. I understand it is culturally standard in some countries, but I neve experienced it before without knowing in advance. Yes, there is a musty type smell to the property, but it is in the rainforest, what would you expect? We did go to all the other Rius in the area, (all close by walking distance) and I think this Palace is the nicest. We went to the new Palace and that was nice, just a little bit bigger pool scene. We did go and rent a car in Cozumel to explore there and that was fun. If I were you I would make sure you go to a Cenotes and snorkel, I have reviewed a specific tour and it was absolutely phenomenal, I highly recommend that without a doubt. Staff-the staff are all super friendly, helpful and kind. You need to bring small bills to tip them, they deserve it. We brought two hundred for the week and went through it all.

It is 4 years since our initial visit for our wedding - although we did return for a day last year when we were holidaying in Cancun. The hotel and team exceeded our expectations from the moment we booked reserving us a beautiful room (with a seaview over the top of the trees). Staff welcomed us back as soon as we walked through the door and were inviting and friendly. Our luggage taken to the room (this didnt happen in Aruba) - while we were making ourselves a drink and starting to relax on our beautiful balcony. The holiday was just amazing from start to finish. The food in the buffet restaurant is superb and vast. We only ate in the steak house speciality restaurant throughout our 15 night stay as we were more than happy with the choice in the buffet (im not a great meat fan but never struggled to choose something different). Booking the speciality restaurants was easy if you chose. Lunch was always in the beach restaurant for us - again plenty of choice and a great service throughout our stay. I never had anything but a tasty cocktail and certainly didnt find them weak as some people mentioned. Cocktails tend to be made with local spirits but if you want branded just ask. The weather was fantastic all the time (I think we had 10 minutes rain 1 day...) so most days we spent relaxing on the beach - which has doubled in size since our last trip (im told a lot of money has been spent on making it larger). The sea can be quite rough on occasions and can be unlevel in places. We had lots of fun on the body boards and boats available from the hotel and free of charge. Drinks were served at the beach - waiters came down with a huge tray to select from - there is also the beach bar set back a little way in the trees should you want something different! We walked into Playacar several times which was nice for some exercise and a change of scenery. We also used the ther hotels around the resort as these tended to be more lively in the evening. We did take the ferry to Cozumel one day and hired a car. It was not great and we would have got a better deal hiring it once we arrived but of course the vendor told us it would be double on the island! The glass bottom boat trip was fantastic though and well worth the $50each as we were the only 2 on it. All in all I really cannot fault Riu Palace Mexico or Playacar.

We recently stayed at the Riu Palace in Cabo san Lucas and decided to try this location because we had been to Playacar before and knew we could swim in the ocean safely at this location. The hotel had a very different feeling and clientele than Cabo San Lucas. It definitely caters to an European customer. The hotel was beautiful and immaculate in grounds keeping, housekeeping and service. We were placed in a wonderful room on the top floor fairly close to the beach - which meant far from the lobby and main restaurants. It would have been OK except my husband has mobility problems and the only elevator was at the far end of the hallway and he cannot do stairs. When we contacted the front desk we were immediately offered a ground room. After moving to the new room we went for dinner at the buffet and was surprised to find that unlike the Cabo buffet, the men were required to wear long pants. This did not make my husband happy! He wears shorts in the winter because he is hot natured. The buffet was nice but I think the food was of better quality and there were more choices at the Cabo buffet . The only specialty restaurant we tried was the steakhouse. The food was very good as was the service. Our favorite place was El Patio for lunch. It offered a good selection of dishes that were very tasty and the choices changed daily. I was particularly happy to see ceviche, guacamole and very spicy chili with meat and beans. Regarding drinks - it seemed as if the drinks were not as strong as in Cabo san Lucas but they were happy to add additional alcohol to your drink if you asked. One improvement I was very happy to see was the addition of a device (don't know what it's called) that kept people from slamming the doors! Now if they could somehow keep maids from moving furniture during siesta time it would be wonderful! It seemed to me that the beds here were harder than in the Cabo location. Hopefully, if the hotels go through renovations in the future they will opt for a slightly softer mattress. My only complaint is that there is only one ice machine for all floors of the hotel! Our bell captain said to just call room service and they would bring us ice. We called for ice and we would still be waiting for the ice if we were there! We enjoyed our stay and are planning on going to the Costa Rica Riu next year. All in all, I think the resorts offer a very good value for the price but I believe that the Cabo San Lucas property is the best so far!

Knowing what to expect is half the battle I believe, and we were not disappointed. We flew out with Thomson on the 13th Sept. We upgraded to Premium as it's a long flight and we went to Riviera Maya last year (Azul Sensatori). The flight was delayed by nearly 4hrs, but we didn't let that spoil things We arrived at 10pm due to the delay and we were the only ones to get off the coach when it pulled up outside the Palace. There was no bellboy or doorman on duty, so we made our own way to reception (no big deal). We were given a welcome drink and I informed them that I'd emailed twice requesting a courtyard view, but hadn't had a reply. They apologised and gave me the keys to 2156. This room overlooks the plaza and sits right on top of the restaurant. We went up to the room and the first thing that I noticed was the A/C not working. It was like an oven! Maintenance came up and agreed with me and they moved us to 2133. This was in a better location, still overlooking the courtyard, but further down near to the pool and beach. The A/C still wasn't great but leaving the fan on made it a little better. The hotel itself is great. If you've stayed at a Palace, you'll know theyre all pretty much the same layout and similar in decor. I'm told this was the 1st Palace Riu built and some would argue it needs a makeover now. I think it just needs tidying up. As has been said, some tiles are cracked and the rooms have keys instead of cards, but that's easily rectified. One thing it does need is a Sports Bar. Most Palaces have them and they're great! You can sit there all night drinking and snacking, whilst watching TV if that's your thing. I'm told it's being refurbed next year and they are putting in a Sports Bar. We'll see. The room was great- two beds pushed together but they didn't move the whole time we were there. There's the famous Riu optics and mini bar, with branded spirits so no locally produced stuff here. Food was great but got a bit repetitive ( they love their beef!). Speciality restaurants were also good but the steakhouse didn't have a non smoking area, which is strange because during the day, it's used as a snack bar and they have a no smoking section. Likewise, at the lobby bar it's no smoking, which is good. I remember the Palace Punta Cana being a smokers paradise and it was awful. We checked out the other RIUs whilst there and took a walk down to the Palace Riviera Maya. This was a newer Palace, in keeping with all the rest, but had a Sports Bar! Strangely, the Riu Tequila had one too, and it's not a Palace? Never did find out why. At night, there's little to do. The entertainment didn't do much for us and we were back in the room most nights at about 10pm, apart from a couple of late sessions in the Lobby and a bar crawl in Cancun. We went to Coco Bongos, which I highly recommend if you've never been! We are definitely going back. Hopefully, next year if funds permit.

It was an excellent price for the money. The were only a couple negatives. The beds are two double beds pushed together to what they call a king bed and the bathroom needs to be revamped. The fixtures for the sink, toilet, bidet and shower are old. The shower/tub area is very dark. They need to add a light in it. But those are all minor things for me. The resort is very beautiful and they keep it immaculate. The beach is very long and wide with lots of chairs and palm trees. The staff were amazing. They were very friendly and always made sure you had everything you need. The pool is a little smaller, but very sufficient. It has a swim up bar on one side and an identical pool on the other with no bar. The two pools are separated by a walkway to the beach. We ate at Fusion, the Japanese and Steakhouse. The Japanese was our favorite. They start off with an excellent sushi plate. We loved the tempura shrimp and veggie appetizer. For main course, the beef and shrimp dishes were the best. The tempura icecream for dessert was great. Fusion was our least favorite, but had a great steak dish. The steakhouse was also very good. The beef was VERY tender and cooked just perfect. If you order dessert, get the Baked Alaska. Very good and entertaining. The buffet always had a wide variety of food. The make your own pasta station was great! Don Julian is the main buffet and only place open for breakfast. You have a few options at lunch, but Don Julian was the best. The drinks are weak, but who wants to be hammered the whole time and if you do, just ask for more alcohol. The mini fridge had four different hard liquors, beer, water and soda. The drinks were prepared the best in the bar by the lobby. The entertainment wasn't that great. It was hit and miss. Not much to do as far as kids activities. They had a very small kids club, but never seen anyone there. Every night, they do have the kids come up on the stage to dance around 8. All the kids enjoyed that. If you like to shop, it is about a 5 min. ride to 5th Avenue for $5 or there are a few shops across the street. The resort and all the shopping is in a gated community and we felt very safe.

We arrived at Riu Palace Riviera Maya and they advised we did not have a booking with them. They took a look at the voucher and advised us to go to the Riu Palace Mexico. Once we got to our hotel- we checked in smoothly, and got to our room only to find two TWIN beds pushed together to make a large sized bed. Also, we had a beautiful view of nothing, basically trees and part of the neighboring hotels tennis court peeking through. The room was stuffy and not comfortable. We tried to upgrade (and of course, pay for the upgrade) but they told us they could only accomodate us for a good reason (like a honeymoon). That's funny since we went during off-season and the hotel was basically empty. So everynight I would end up in the gap between the two beds, pretty much pushing the beds apart and falling into the gap that was made! The hotel was all in all was nice. The staff was amazing. The beach was incredible. There are a number of restaurants to eat at with reservations (which can only be made from 8 30-1030 am). If you dont have a reservation, you will be eating at a daily themed buffet for dinner. The food is edible, not great. I guess we expected to eat authentic Mexican food, and of course, there was only 1 night of mexican themed food at the buffet and we missed it. We ate out in town 90% of the time.

Sure, the grounds are spectacular - a more beautiful resort complex you'd be hard pressed to find. It was very well tended and extremely well manicured and shiny/squeaky clean. Great maid service and turn down service and extra towels - just like before. The food, however, was not very good. I know, people complain about the food at the all-inclusives all the time. Or they get excited about the variety at the buffets. We tend to like the restaurants and always try to get our meals there. We were at the Riu Palace Negril earlier this year and the food there was FAR superior. The restaurants this time seem to just mail it in - the steak house was not good at all. The Japanese restaurant was probably the best - and I'm not a fan of Japanese food. The \"Fusion\" restaurant was the worst. All in all, pretty tasteless and uninspired. That's NOT what we had the last time we were here. Plus lunch was noticeably bland no matter where you got it. The Beach: One thing we remembered the first day at the beach that we had forgotten about - the huge dropoff as you walk out into the water. There's a huge step down and after 10 yards or so, you climb back up onto a sandbar where it levels off more gradually and proceeds to deeper water. It made many people have a lot of difficulty exiting the water - lot of them had to be helped up out of the ocean because they couldn't navigate the steep step out onto the sand. Just a cautionary advisory. We loved the trees and the shady areas all throughout the beach. You can be in complete shade all day long if you want.

I have not been to a hotel that didn't have key cards in at least 8-10 years. 2) The \"king\" beds are 2 beds pushed together that slide apart throughout the night 3) The pool does not have steps to walk into it. 4) If you want to go to the night club or sports bar you have to go to across the street to Riu Tequila Now on to the positive: The service was spectacular. The food was very good. The beach was pristine. If you are looking for a resort to relax at this is it. We went over to all the other Riu resorts in the area and this one was definitely the least crowded. FYI if you do go over to one of the other resorts to check out the pool or beach be sure to take your towel as we had a hard time exchanging our towel cards for towels while there. We went to all of the specialty restaurants and my husband like the brazilian the most, I prefered Krystal, we didn't really like the Japannese.

Nice space at the end with couch / table & telly , which led to a small balcony looking onto a path around the back of the complex. The bed was a bit hard & the bathroom was a bit tired looking especially the small bath with shower over, however the room was spacious , impeccably cleaned each day & minor problems with a couple of light bulbs & the toilet running were dealt with quickly when raised . The pool was bit of a disappointment as it was quite small & split in half by a main path through the complex to the beach. However the staff down there looked after you well(towel change, book exchange, bar & waiters ). We don't normally do 5 star so was a bit of shock not having to get off the sun lounger to get a drink, the waiters round the pool area are continually , serving drinks, tidying glasses & generally making sure that you are ok. The main buffet was very good , with a lot of choice a number of different show cooking stations & in addition on various nights held theme evenings. The speciality restaurants were a bit hit & miss, Grill down by the beach & Krsyal Fusion were nice & they made a great effort to look after you. The Brazilian was OK , but most of the meats you get in the buffet from the show stations & the Japanese food wasn't very nice, late letting you in, people were being rushed to leave before they finished their meal to make space for 2nd sitting & this was caused by the staff being late letting people in & their slow service. The other facilities were beautiful especially the Lounge bar , with dark wood & the large chandelier in the main atrium . The staff & reception & the bars really did their best to make people welcome & relax. I guess one of the issues were mosquitos , they were biting everyone & jungle Formula didn't appear to work (even the 50% deet high strength) , however when chatted to the rep , she advised we buy a local deterrent called \"OFF\" form the nearby pharmacy & that seemd to keep the little biters at bay. The only other issue we had was the wife had bit of a funny tummy for a few datys, & so did a few othe other guests we talked to, but I think this was probably down to the heat & humidity rather than anything else . The temperatures were 40+ C the humidity was in the 90s . Some people were overheating under the sun brolleys as they don't block the heat like the palm leave roofed stations in other parts of the carribean. As it was during the World cup, the hotel set asid one of the conference room with a projector screen & a couple of tellys.

Not a singles destination though.\u201d", "Author": "TMG0440", "ReviewID": "UR81907450", "Content": "This was my first trip to Playa Del Carmen although I have stayed in Cancun several times. I found the Riu Palace Mexico to be a good value for the money but with a few areas that could use improvement. I think these are mainly due to the natural aging process. PROS: My stay was from September 11-18, 2010. Upon arrival, I was greeted by Manuel, the doorman. During the entire week of my stay, he always greeted me by name and gave me a \"fist bump\" greeting. He made me feel welcome. Upon check in, the front desk staff saw that it was my birthday and offered me an upgraded room, #1047. It was September, so I'm sure they had rooms to spare. But it just illustrates that the hotel's attitude is to service and please the customer. Without exception, that's how I was treated during my whole stay. The grounds of the hotel are meticulously manicured and maintained. The Beach is very nice. I liked that you walked through a shady grove of palms get there. You have the option of staying under the trees if you prefer not to cook or laying on the wide open beach. There were always plenty of lounge chairs no matter the time of day. The ocean water was a very pleasant temperature also. One day, a group of people took some bread out into the water with them and were feeding the fish. The fish that fed looked like frisbee-sized angel fish. Very cool! The food was good with lots of variety. I always found plenty of options that I liked or wanted to try. I didn't go to any specialty restaurants so I cannot comment on them. One day, I had a migraine so I booked a massage on the beach. It was raining that day so it was very peaceful and relaxing. The massage girl found that my back was full of knots and the treatment helped me tremendously. CONS: Generally, my complaints are minor. The first being that the hotel is showing it's age. There are many cracked or chipped tiles in the halls and corridors. There are areas that need some paint and touch up too. All cosmetic but they're things that I noticed. My main complaint was the air conditioning in my room. It was BARELY able to keep up. The unit's blower only put out a slight amount of air, even on the highest setting. I needed to keep the ceiling fan on at all times to keep the air moving. Without the fan, I think it would not have kept up. On the second to last day of my stay, they worked on the adjacent room's air conditioning and needed to access the A/C unit in my room too. After they were through, my A/C unit had developed a vibration noise in the blower. It sort of sounded like water-hammering in pipes, but not that loud. I have a background in maintenance so I know exactly what happened. They knocked the blower out of balance when they were messing with it. I comlplained to the desk and supposedly someone went to look at it. It wasn't fixed though. Since I'm a heavy sleeper, I just decided to live with it for one night. Speaking of maintenance, I noticed several things that wouldn't get by Q.C. in the states. The most noticeable being the florescent fixture over the sink. There were exposed wires due to the ballast being replaced and the cover not replaced correctly. I guess you have to expect things like that because of the quality and training of the maintenance staff in Mexico. Also, the shower drain was very slow. There was always a big puddle of water and soap suds around your feet while you dried off. As I said, minor complaints but worth mentioning, I feel. On a side note... I am a single traveler. Next time, I would probably stay at one of the sister properties instead of the Palace. During my whole stay, I didn't run into another single traveler at the hotel. It's definitely a couples destination. The Riu Tequila across the street was packed with a younger, more lively crowd. If I'm still single and go back to Playa, that's where I'll stay. Lot's of Europeans at the Tequila, I noticed. That would make it even more interesting to me. All in all, I would recommend the RPM if you're a couple or family. My package was through CheapCaribbean.com and very reasonably priced for the level of service I received. If you're single or young and fun. I'd stay somewhere else.

We payed the most for this trip at this hotel and I would not stay there again, it was not worth the money. I would recommend staying at any of the Iberostars, Sandos Playcar Riviera or others for the price. My husband and I stayed at the Riu Palace Mexico for a friends wedding with a large group for one week over 4th of July. The resort grounds are beautiful and is on one of the best beaches \"Playacar\". Unfortunately the food at the buffet was better than any of their specialty restaurants except for the Japanese and I am not a picky eater. Service was decent at the buffet but at the specialty restaurants the staff seemed \"put out\". The pool area is very small for such a large fancy resort. Pool bar staff was okay. Rooms were nice size but the bathrooms were horrible. Shower area was back in the corner and very dark. Not 5 star in my opinion. Entertainment was okay, typical for \"Mexico all-inclusive\". Their show \"Grease\" was good and the Michael Jackson night was entertaining. In the week that we were there at some point or another we all got sick and a few people in our group were sick for weeks after we got back. My husband, me, daughter and mom have never gotten sick at any other resort in Mexico. I thought this was strange. Walked to the Riu Palace Riviera Maya and ate lunch there and used the pool, that pool is much nicer. Resort also seemed much livelier than the Mexico.

Second floor rooms have smaller balconies, so if you want a larger balcony ask for another room if your room number is between 2000-2100 Leave the air conditioning on all the time, Mexico is very humid and if you turn it off a lot it could make the room smell damp. Bring along a batch of one dollar bills, the service is very good anyway but it gets better if you leave a dollar tip every now and then. The cleaner will probably leave you a towel animal in the room, if you leave them a dollar by the animal they will normally do a different one each day, I didn't know it was possible to make towel monkeys..... the pool away from the bar is quieter, there's a sign saying no ball games, but no-one minds if you're just throwing a ball to each other in the pool. the Jacuzzi is round this side as well, it hidden but definitely worth using.

We had a great time on the trip and felt the resort was a good value. The staff for the most part was very friendly and the beach is wonderful. The rooms are older and could use updating; the key is an old time relic. The beds are crazy, why they push two together like this is beyond me. The mini refrigerator in one room did not workwell sot we just stocked up in the second room. We did not use room service, it is available but the menu is limited. We ate at the buffet most meals and it was quite good. There is a variety of food and it is well prepared, The wait staff was very attentive and friendly. We ate at the Fusion and Japanese speciality resturants. The Fusion food and staff was wonderful; they met us at the entrance with a glass of champagne! The appetizer had foam which was alright but a little different. The Japanese Resturant did not meet the service standard and was one of the disappointments of our trip. I had read great reviews but I really think they wait staff was not assigned to our table. We had to ask for beverages and menus after everyone else was served. I don't know how this happen since the dining area is small. The food was good but not great. And the way to make a reservation is not well explained. In the morning the day the guest wants a reservation the guest must go to the bar area downstairs and sit at 0800 and wait for a staff member to arrive and pass out numbers. When your number is called you go up to the staff member and put in your request. The problem is there can be a stampede to get the number. The first morning I did this I was not expecting the pushing and rush to get in line. The next morning the guest were much more civilzed and orderly. Be prepared. Dress code. The men must wear long pants in the evening to the buffet. The women can wear shorts, halter tops and flip flops. Beach: topless sunbathers. Not that I am very conservative but most of the women that were topless should not have been. Gravity over time wins. There is no nightlife at this resort . The Rui Tequila across the street has a disco and more lively evening shows. Internet access. You can pay a fee to use the lap top computers in the lobby. This was nice to check on things at home. Things to do differently Our trip was through Apple Vacations and we did arrange for a non-stop transfer from the Cancun Airport however next time I think we will cab it or look into alternatives; even though the transfer is non-stop, we sat in the van for 45 minutes before it left the airport and the representative had report to the hotel lobby 1 hour and 15 minutes prior to pick up. I didn't think this was worth the extra cash. We had a great time and would go back again without any hesitation. The drinks were good the beach access and pool were wonderful.

We really liked the hotel. I will try to summarize what we liked and what we didn't. Even though I will rate this hotel as a five-star resort, there are still some things to improve. Trip to and from airport: This will take you an hour but is not that bad. Rooms: Now beware: your room can smell of mold. When we first go there, they gave us a room on the 1st floor. We walked in and it smelled really really moldy. We thought maybe it is the cleaning stuff that they use for the floor, decided to stay the night and air the room. The smell of mold stayed and I am not sure how we even slept. Then we went to the reception early the next morning, complained about the moldy smell and they gave us a new room on the 2nd floor (which is better). So if you don't like your room - tell them your first hour there! They will stock your fridge every day and clean the room really well. Restaurants: There is a buffet and there are specialty restaurants. We found the buffet great. On our last night we had lobsters - and we could eat as many as we wanted. There was always a great variety. Also - perfect service. They are very attentive. Coffee is bad but you can go to the bar at 10am and order a capuccino. As for the specialty restaurants: we had to wait in the theater, take a number, then come 30 min later and make a reservation. It is kind of a hassle and you need to plan in advance and wait. Some people actully took their books to read and wait. I recommend the steakhouse. My boyfriend had his birthday there and they brought him a chocolate cake and started singing - very friendly and great service. Was not impressed with the sushi place - but then again - sushi in Mexico is kind of streching it. The Krystal place is OK. But all the inside restaurants were really cold as AC is on full blast. The food for lunch is kind of repetitive and we ate at the restaurant by the beach. You cannot eat there though in your bikini so put some clothes on! Beach: gorgeous clean beach. Lots of sand. Nice chairs. You will have a guy walking around and offering drinks about every 20 min. You can also take a walk on the beach all the way to the town and you will see lots of weddings take place. We saw about 5. There is also a pool and we took a water aerobics class which was really fun. What you also can do is take a walk to a different Riu resort. We did that and actually thought ours was the best one. Entertainment: this was kind of a weak I thought. They were trying with the shows but I was not really impressed.

The service (from the bellhop to the reception desk to the housekeeping staff to the men serving drinks at the beach) was outstanding. Everyone always had a smile on their faces and went out of their way to accommodate us. The hotel was beautiful and very well kept. There were always staff members ensuring that everything on the premises was clean as well. You truly feel as if you are in a palace because of how beautiful the place is and because of how well you are treated. Food and drinks are very plentiful. The great thing about it was that there were a variety of restaurants to choose from and even at the buffet there were theme nights, so you don't really get bored of the food too easily. The minibar is always stocked well and there is never a shortage of any drink, including bottled water. The only complaints I have about the food/drinks were 1) you have to make reservations for the a la carte restaurants (which is understandable), but you can only make them the morning of between 8:30 and 10. Although, we went on 2 excursions and were not there during the reservation time, but when we came back, we went to the front desk and asked if there was anything open and they were able to accommodate us. And the buffet is good, so it's not the worst thing in the world if you can't get to the a la carte once or twice. But that was still a little annoying. 2) The mixed drinks were very weak, so if you like them strong, I would recommend asking for an extra shot or two. The beach is beautiful and right off of the hotel. There is also a BBQ on the beach and a bar, as well as men walking around very frequently serving drinks. There are also two buffets off of the beach. So if you're hungry around lunch time, you don't have to leave the beach and change for lunch. The pool was also nice, but it was a little small. The water in the pool was also a little warmer than I would expect it to be, but it wasn't a bad pool. The rooms were very spacious and clean. The housekeeping even put adorable towel animals in the room, which added a nice little touch! The balcony was also very roomy and nice to sit out on and relax with a drink in the evening. While everything in the room was very nice and well stocked, the bed was slightly hard. If you have trouble sleeping on a mattress that is not super plush, this may not be the place for you. While the mattress was a little hard, I never had a bad night's sleep. The location that the hotel is located in is very safe and is a nice little area to walk around. There is a little flea market 2 minutes away from the hotel that was nice for souvenirs as well. While it is not central to 5th Avenue and the center of Playa del Carmen, taxis are abundant and it is easy to get anywhere that you would need to (it seems that many of the tours we looked at offered transportation directly to hotels as well). Overall, I really enjoyed my stay here and would recommend it to anyone going to Playa del Carmen. There were a lot of great amenities and the service was outstanding.

The beach is clean and there were always plenty of sun loungers to choose from in the shade or direct sun.

We ate at the Krystal, steakhouse and Brazilian restaurants...I wouldn't recommend eating at these and thought the buffut was much better quality food, however sitting down to a 3 course meal did make the dining experience feel more varied. The Krystal restaurant served some a variety of food (with alot of foam) in one meal I had tomato and watermelon foam, mushroom foam and another that I forgot! The steakhouse was OK, nothing that great and the Brazilian was terrible. The side order of potato and veg came out a long time before any meat. The server came around with skewers of meat and cut one small piece of meat but didn't seem to know what meat they were serving, also ou get sauces to accompany the meats, but the server could not explain what these were.

At the end of the day when they are cleaning out the bar by the pool there was a slight drain smell. We visited all the other RIU hotels nearby and felt ours was the best. The other Palace hotel down the road appeared to be a newer building, but there certainly was an unpleasant smell here like vomit.

We are a young couple who enjoys relaxing on the beach, but also some fun nightlife. This hotel is DEAD after 10pm. The pool is great to lay out and nap by, but not the place to look for fun. The water also was warmer than the ocean. The beach, however, was perfect. We loved all of the palm trees under which we napped daily. There were plenty of loungers available. The drinks here were not strong, but the bartenders were always happy to add more liquor if requested. Service at this resort is OUTSTANDING. We Our stay was great for the price! We loved the food so much I gained 4 pounds in our 4 day trip:) We ate the buffet every night, and even ate it once and hour and a half before our scheduled dinner! I loved the breakfast buffet, especially the smoothie bar, omelette station, and Mimosa stand. They have free wi-fi in the lobby near the bar (so don't pay the $15 for 15 minutes). The only negative we noted to this resort were the rooms that were dated and dingy smelling. Our bed was somewhat laughable. It was two full-sized beds pushed together to make one big bed....but each bed was individually made. Thus, you end up sleeping in a full. And the beds move apart! I also didn't like that we had to carry around an old-school room key. Plus, the walls must be thin, since we were woken up one night by our \"enthusiastic\" neighbors. We did like that staying in a Riu \"palace\" entitled you to visit any other Rius in the Playacar area. We went to Riu Tequila one afternoon to watch the World Cup at the disco. We also spent one day at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya, which we LOVED. The pool area here was HOPPING.....which was exactly what we were looking for.

Many people that write negative review regarding Palace Mexico don\u2019t take into consideration thing such as location, size of the property and relatively small amount of guests. Since I have visited Playa for so many years been there more than 10 times I know all the ins and out and abouts. Location: Take a taxi and in 4 min you are in down town Playa where you can find a public bus station that will take you all around Yucatan peninsula and even to Cancun. Busses are safe, clean and cheep ( about $2 us dollars one way) you can go explore places like Tulum, Xel-ha and many others without buying ridiculously priced packages from tour agent or a hotel. On a different day make sure to visit Cozumel (I have never seen more beautiful waters) make sure that you don\u2019t see the cruise ships on the horizon prior to going. Rent a scooter or a car and take a ride, it is breath taking. Size of the Property: Palace Mexico in itself is large, and by far has the largest beach comparing to the most properties in Cancun. First there are no corals in the water, second the water is quieter than other places due to the fact that it is protected from the winds by Cozumel. Small number of guests: A lot of guests choose the new palace which is a bit nicer in terms of the smell situation. Otherwise it is smaller, much more crowded, far from Riu Tequila (for the night disco) and overall missing that grand feeling that Palace Mexico does. Negative: The smell is bad. Many hotels in the overall Caribbean region have an issue with smell. Royal hideaway doesn\u2019t but it is small and boring and really really quiet with practically nonexistent beach. I usually bring incense and burn them so that the room smells a bit better. Mosquitoes are monsters and their bites hurt like hell. So, buy the mosquitoes spray that they sell in the hotels store (Mexican one). Spray yourself outside your room (it smell so bad) try not to breath and you will be safe for the night. Make sure to rinse it off before bad. Food is redundant. Personally I don\u2019t go to a vacation to eat. I like to look good feel great and move around a lot. I love to dink, especially Champaign and screw drivers (regardless of the order). My food recommendation try Mexican McDonalds, it taste like Mc Donald\u2019s from your childhood and looks the same as well. He he, large review, hope it helps.

The first thing you can't help but notice about this hotel is the dreadful smell as you walk in the doors at reception. Even the joss sticks they burn don't mask it, its awful. Reception service was very poor. We experienced rain whilst there and noticed that everyone had red and white stripped umbrellas and asked at reception were we could purchased some, we were told the umbrella is in the wardrobe which is clearly was not. We asked for an umbrella on 3 occasions without success, thank god the sun came out. We also asked reception to contact another riu in cancun and we were told to contact them ourselves!!. The food is so repetitive that you get sick of looking for something to eat. We tried the steak house which should be renamed grizzle fat house, dreadful and the fushion which was just as bad. The fact that you don't have to queue for a ticket for these restaurants is a good indication of how popular they are. If you are used to good quality food then its a NO. All of us had tummy trouble whilst staying at this hotel and so did most of the guest we spoke to. The beds are hard even with the famous Rui topper. On several occasions going to or from our room we saw a mattress in the corridor were they were changing the bed or bed combination maybe, I don't really know, but the stains on these mattresses were awful and I worried what I was sleeping on but could not bring myself to look under the sheets. Staff work extremely hard and hotel is very clean. The beach is fabulous now, so wide and plenty of sun loungers. You also get waiter service for all your drinks as you lounge by the pool. We would never stay at this hotel again. It is definitely not a 5* and needs refurbishment. We stayed at high season and the hotel was not full. Each day the Riu Tequila brings people over for a tour of the hotel to try and drum up customers for next year but they don't do that at the Riviera Maya which is on the same road, because they don't have to it was busy. Some people we spoke to said the hotel was fantastic but it was their first time in Mexico or to an all inclusive and I guess once they have tried some others they will change their minds. We still had a fantastic holiday and that was because is was a Palace and the all inclusive band of a Palace allows you to go in any other Riu hotel. There are 4 Riu in this area and the Riviera Maya Palace and we used them all, thats what made our holiday. The Riviera Maya is beautiful and a world apart from the Palace Mexico. The entertainment at the Riu Tequila was fab. Our two teenagers spent most of their time in the sports bar there. We also visited Riu Cancun and the Palace Las America next door which were also gorgeous, and you can have your breakfast and lunch in any of these hotels and also your drinks just not your evening meal. I suppose you could say the safety net of a Palace is if your not happy you can move around and its also your chance to see the other hotels should you decide to return.", "Date": "August 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cYou can do better!\u201d", "Author": "b305miami", "ReviewID": "UR74472430", "Content": "I just returned from a three day stay at the Riu Palace Mexico.

The food is lovely - no complaints but I have to mention that apart from the kids (prob because all they ate was pizza!) my husband and I had tummy upsets. I just put this down to where we were - it wasn't dirty or not cooked properly but a lot of people we spoke to seemed to be suffering the same. Tummy cramps but no sickness just the other end.

On more positive notes, the hotel is beautiful, rooms are lovely, everything is very clean, the drinks are great - no rubbish local petrol style alcohol, good cocktails, mixed very well with brand name alcohol, the beach is amazing, the local trips are great, going into town to Playa Del Carmen is so much fun, the pool drinks service is brilliant - tip them sometimes, they deserve it.

The resort is beautiful! Our room was spacious. I do agree with the post about their clothes smelling when they got back and unpacked the luggage. Our clothes did too. I didn't smell it when we were there though. FOOD We did not eat in any of the \"special\" restaurants. We ate the buffet most mornings and every lunch and dinner. Dinner is always pants for the guys. That is something to keep in mind when packing for this resort. The food was good. The second night we were there though my husband started to get sick the 3rd day he was having frequent belly aches and on the 4th day I thought I should take him to the hospital. He did not want to go and had chills, dizziness and the runs (tmi I know) and TERRIBLE belly cramps. I also kept have sporadic belly aches. We are home now and we are both still sick, better than when we were there though. We did not directly drink any water. I am thinking it was the buffet. The food was all good. The service at the buffet was excellent. Friendly, friendly staff! DRINKS I never tasted any alcohol in any of the drinks that I had. I had the Coco Rosa, the Mango Tango, Sunshine and margaritas. Oh and on a side note - they have no Crown Royal. (husbands favorite) THE BEACH We found chairs every single day that we went to the beach with no problems. The only shade comes from the palms. The sand was not powdery like you would find in Destin or Panama City Beach in Florida. It has some shells in it too. But on a whole the beach was nice. Lots of activity. Jet skis, boats, kayaks, snorkeling tours......when swimming you will smell the water crafts as they come and go. They do have an area roped off for only swimmers but there were kayakers that came in there. Not sure if they were allowed. Snorkeling gear is free at the Scuba Caribe on the beach. Kayaks were too even though we didn't use them. THE ROOM Nice room. We had a junior suite with a sunken in den that had a couch that made a bed. There is a bidet in the bathroom. I took my macbook pro...it did NOT fit in the safe so I was locking it in my suitcase every day. Ipad fit fine and small cameras and other small items. We had one really big roach that probably crawled in through the sliding glass doors. That did not bother me. Bugs can get in anywhere. MOSQUITOS are terrible about getting into your room. I swear they WAIT for you to open your door and fly in. The maids keep the doors open while they are cleaning so every day when we came back we had a bunch in our room flying around our heads. On our 2nd morning there they started renovating the room next to us. They were scraping and sanding and banging before 8am! Being\" later than 8 am sleepers\" they woke us up. The sounds went on ALL day. We complained (we are not complaining people) at the front desk and he did nothing then about 4:30pm. we called the front desk and the front desk girl came down and yelled at them but they still stayed until 5pm banging. The next morning (check out morning) they were back at it at 7am waking us up again. We complained again at check out and we were told that they were sorry. THE POOL HOT HOT HOT! I thought it was heated but that was just the temp! They have a towel station. When you check in they give you one towel card per person. When you go get towels you give them your card and they give you the number of towels per cards. If you don't turn your cards in during checkout they charge you 20 bucks per towel. Watch your towels while on the beach, I heard some towels came up missing. Wi-Fi Only in the lobby and bar area. Wish it could have been in our rooms. TRANSPORTATION Very easy! Transfer vans were always there. Taxis called by the bellhop are easy to find at most any time. GIFT SHOP Convenient but overpriced a bit. Nice clerks. EXCURSIONS We did the snorkeling booked through Lomas Travel (thank you Jorge)! AWESOME!!! SO MUCH FUN! Swimming with the dolphins at DOLPHINARIS. FUN!! If you can take the offer at the Cancun airport for 100 bucks per couple! WAAAY CHEAPER but you do have to sit through a 2 hour presentation at a resort. We didn't do this but wished that we had. A couple on our snorkeling trip did it and save a TON of money!

We have stayed there once before and this time friends joined us for the first time. I was worried that they may not enjoy it as much as we had but I am glad to say they did. From check in everything was wonderful including they gave us the room I had requested and our friends were right next door. They main thing about the hotel is the wonderful staff, they were always so happy and could not do enough for us. It was hard work turning down all the drinks we were offered down at the pool. I think they must get great training as they are all so hard working. The management too were always about making sure everything was working as it should. We tried all the a la carte restaurants and liked them all but the buffet was excellent and we went to this most as we could all eat what we wanted and at our own pace. We went to different tables for breakfast, lunch and dinner but the staff got to know us and decorated our table with flowers which was a lovely touch. We did tip for drinks and meals but not a lot and they certainly did not look for tips and many people do not seem to tip but I know they dont earn a lot and we liked to give them something. We ate lunch a few days at the other palace and it was nice for a change, we also went out to some of the other hotels for drinks but we did like our hotel best. One last thing be sure and go in the sea, it is lovely and warm, we liked it best last in the afternoon when it was not too busy and not too hot. The only thing we did not enjoy was the wine, we tried them all but finally just stuck to champagne all the time as we all enjoyed that. Not such a hardship for us.

This was our third stay at a Riu resort and it was just as good as Riu Palace Riviera Maya. I would recommend this resort to anyone wanting to stay at a very nice resort, with an outstanding staff, beautiful grounds, great food, and a wonderful beach. Here is a breakdown of our stay: - Check-in was very quick. Jonathan was polite and informative. We got our keys and were headed to our room within 10 minutes of arriving at the resort. - Room: Very good. We had a non-courtyard view which was fine with us since we weren\u2019t in our room very much anyway. Rooms have a sitting area, flat screen TV, mini-bar, and ceiling fan. The AC worked well. The only difference I noticed between the Palace Mexico and Palace Riviera Maya were the bathrooms. The Palace Mexico\u2019s bathroom was much smaller and didn\u2019t have a jetted tub. - Food: I truly believe this is where Riu resorts excel. The buffet was very large and lots of options. We weren\u2019t displeased with any of the options at the buffet whether it is breakfast, lunch, or supper. The a-la-carte restaurants were great. The Japanese restaurant and Krystal were by far our favorites. The steakhouse was nearly as good. The Brazilian was our least favorite. I didn\u2019t mind making reservations for the a-la-carts\u2026I actually enjoyed knowing that I was going to eat at a specific time (no waiting) and at a specific restaurant. - Drinks: Nothing to complain about here. If you want top shelf liquor just ask\u2026If you want more/less liquor in your drink just ask\u2026I was able to get Don Julio anywhere I went. All of the bars were great. My favorites were the beach bar and the pool bar. Johnny, at the pool bar, is outstanding\u2026he was very busy but easily kept up with drink orders and conversation. He took the time to talk with us during a less busy time. I really enjoyed getting to know him and I look forward to seeing him next time we stay. Hector was also great. He knew what and when to bring us drinks when we were on the beach. He\u2019d always stop by and have refills for my bubba mug. Great job guys you made our stay enjoyable and special. - Beach: Amazing! Lots of palms for shade, plenty of loungers, and a large beach with soft white sand. I will caution you to be careful when entering and exiting the ocean. There is a drop-off as you enter the water which can be a little difficult to navigate after a day of beer and margaritas. We found lots of shells on the beach and at the waterline. - Location: Perfect. As a Riu Palace guest you have access to all of the other Riu resorts. The Riu Yucatan is on the south side of the resort, the Riu Tequila is just across the street, and the Riu Playacar and Palace Riviera Maya is just a short walk away. We enjoyed visiting the Tequila which has better nightlife (shows/sports bar/disco) than the Palace Mexico. - Entertainment: Good. We enjoyed the Michael Jackson show and the Grease show. The Mexican show at the Tequila looked enjoyable also, but we arrived as it was just ending so we didn\u2019t get to see too much of it. During the evening they had a band playing in the courtyard which was nice. - Towel Service: This was the only area that I was disappointed. Guests are given a towel card that you exchange for a towel. The problem is the towel hut closes at 6pm and you are only allowed to exchange your towel once during the day. This becomes a problem when it rains. We were on the beach when a hard/short rain began which soaked our towels. We took them back to exchange for dry towels. Then another shower came on which again soaked our towels. They weren\u2019t going to allow us to exchange since we already changed once. I explained that the towels were unusable due to the rain. Eventually they let us exchange once more. Just words of advice\u2026protect your towels and keep them dry. Overall we loved our stay at the Riu Palace Mexico. It\u2019s the type of place that makes their guests feel important and special. The resort met our expectations and we will return. Extras: - Don\u2019t miss La Quinta Avenida. It\u2019s a one of a kind experience. Only a $50 peso cab ride from the Riu. It has a Bourbon Street feel to it, for anyone that\u2019s been to New Orleans. - We used Cancun Transfers for our private transfers to and from the airport. Irma and Milton were great. We would recommend them to anyone needed transfers. - Playacar Plaza is a small shopping area a couple of steps from the resort. It\u2019s a good place to go if you need something.

Our room wasn't too bad ( we were in room 31) and the house-keeping did a great job every day of cleaning the room. The location of the room was pretty central to everything that the hotel had to offer; from the restaurants to the beach, we never had to walk very far. One weird thing about our room was the shower... for the first 7 of our 10 days we never had hot water, it was luke warm at best all the time with the nob all the way on hot. On the 8th day I was taking a shower when my wife tried to wash her face in the sink and all of a sudden the water in the shower went to boiling hot!!!! So apparently, you have to turn the sink on a little bit in order to have hot water for your shower. I don't know why, but it worked for us. I read another review saying that the hot water never came on during their entire trip, so I'm sure the other rooms are the same way. The food was very good all around. They had 4 or 5 different specialty restaurants that were very tasty. My favorite was probably the Brazilian steakhouse! We've been to a lot of different all inclusive's in Mexico and the buffet here was by far the best! (For a buffet). The staff was exceptional with removing plates and filling drinks... I never had an empty glass anywhere I went!!! The beach was simply amazing. I really love that there are palm tree's everywhere for shade and there was always chairs open to layout. The resort has employee's on beach bringing around drinks for you to drink all the time. There was only one afternoon in the 10 days that I was there when I didn't see somebody bringing drinks around. Not bad! The pool area is fair at best and the mixed drinks at the bar needed help. It's not that they didn't have alcohol, but that they lacked flavor. Even all of the mixed drinks at this resort and the Riu Palace Maya (the more expensive one) a couple resorts down, sucked. They just don't know how to make'em I guess. The pool has a weird design and is pretty small. They do offer free scuba diving lessons in the pool though which was pretty fun. The last thing that I really liked was that it didn't have the young party crowd. There was a handful of folks with baby's and such, but for the most part the people their were laid back and fun... not the cancun party scene! Which we really liked.

I even needed a blanket a few nights. We did eat at each specialty restaurant and my opinions are as follows.. Steak House- Very good. I had a rack of lamb that was perfect and my husband had a steak that was also cooked to perfection. Krystal- Our favorite we ate here 2 nights and loved everything we had. Japanese- We do eat Japanese often at home in NY and were pleasantly surprised by how good it was. Brazilian- Both my husband and I did not enjoy this one at all.

Buffet- Was well stocked and good quality. We enjoyed the food and selection. The service was 5 star at all the places. The staff is wonderful and I can't say enough about them. Riu should be proud of their staff. The pools were nice although fairly small compared to other places. The pool bar was in one pool (the noisier ofthe 2) We preferred that quiet one. The bar service was amazing, constant service no matter where you were sitting. Both pools was clean and well maintained. The beach was HUGE! There were plenty of chairs even though the hotel was quite full. It was absolutely beautiful. Our favorite bar was in the lobby, I feel the best drinks were made there.

We stopped in to the Riu Palace Riveria Maya just up the street, and while that is a sililar but newer hotel...the service at this place can't be beat. One of the other reviewers said that the staff seemed to be very proud of their hotel. That sums it up best. Most everyone from the landscaping crew to the hosts and hostesses in the dining area were very accomodating and friendly. I had one bad experience in the La Bodega restaurant where I asked for a vodka and tonic to drink and the waitress gave me a dirty look because she apparently had to walk out of the restaurant to get the drink. She grudgingly got it, but it was an awkward moment in an otherwise great stay. I wish I would have gotten her name. The front desk folks were very helpful and welcoming. The doorman seemed very proud of his hotel. The food was incredible. I did not find one single piece of produce that was not fresh and perfectly ripe in the buffet restaurant. They had a nice variety, and again...the service was absoloutely outstanding. One night they had sushi. Another night, they had a Mexican theme. Their red snapper and salmon dishes were about the best I have ever had. I was eyeing up a dish when one of the chef's came up to me and said \"you've got to try this...it's really good\". The hotel was immaculately clean. I even saw them cleaning the railing baulsters regularly. Anybody do that at their own house? The grounds were impeccably landscaped. The room was fine and adequately sized, although not lavish. The furniture was decent. The AC worked well. The tap water was not potable. It did seem to leave a bit of a film after your shower, but we dealt with it. We had no issues with ambient noise. Everything was pretty quiet. The nightly entertainment was decent, but I didn't go there for a stage show. If you stay in one of the two \"palaces\" , you can do anything at the other Riu hotels in the area except eat dinner. This is a nice feature because it gives you more room to roam while not straying far from food, drink or a place to sit and relax. The hotel is in the Playacar area of Playa Del Carmen, which is a gated community with security at each end of the road running through it. We took a quick cab ride from Playacar to the town of Playa Del Carmen, and it was like going from peace and tranquility to chaos...but friendly chaos. I felt very safe throughout my stay. If I have the chance, I would definitely stay here again and recommend the place to a friend. If I do go back, I would pick a different time of year than late June/early July. The weather was hotter than hot, and very humid. We are experiencing a heatwave in the Northeastern US this week, but I laugh when people say it is hot here.

Before I get to anything negative, let me start out by saying that the service at this property was EXCELLENT! This was our third trip to the Riviera Maya and our second visit to a Riu property. We stayed at the Yucatan the last time we were there and found it to be crowded. This palace was nice, but be warned that for the most part there is really nothing going on, especially at night. The main problem we had here was the pool. Besides being small, there is no easy way to get in the pool-unless you jump. There are no steps or ramps that make it easy to get in or out. The beach area is fine and that's where I spent most of my time. The hammocks that they have on the beach is a nice touch. The beach has been renovated, so now it is wide and smooth, just look out for a small drop off. The food was good, but we never ate at any of the specialty restaurants. We have found that since the same cooks are making the food there, were better off just eating in the buffet. As usual, the drinks were fine. I always ask for something premium, so there is never a problem. Be warned you Americans, they only provide Dos Equis beer. I used the gym that they had there and it was small but adequate and we visited all the other properties, just to hang out someplace different and found that theirs not much difference. We went into Playa Del Carmen a few days, again, just to do something different. Since we have been here many times it was still the same. Remember, always haggle over anything you buy! Never pay the first asking price. In conclusion, my wife and I did have stomach issues the last couple of days, but we found out that quite a few other people had the same problems. The Riu Palace is a nice place and not that much different form the other Palace. As I stated earlier, the service was excellent and we did show a lot of the staff how much we appreciated them-via tips. If you do visit, just consider the pool and nightlife, but if your going there to relax, you can't go wrong.", "Date": "June 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chilliwack, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Great Resort!\u201d", "Author": "freddyde", "ReviewID": "UR68663471", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Riu Palace Mexico for 1 week on June 5 and it was great.

Originally, after weeks of reading reviews of the top choices in Playa we planned on the Royal. It got sold out. We then sighted in on the Riu Palace Riveira Maya and once again it sold out. We quickly reviewed the Riu Palace Mexico and pulled the trigger on a Jr. Suite Courtyard. We traveled with a couple that got the regular Jr. Suite. We got a view of the courtyard for $200 more, they got a pretty nice view of tennis courts and trees. I would not have minded it at all. I read reviews about the front desk being unhelpful. This was so far from my experience. Jonathan was very nice and helpful, getting us rooms close together and moving us to the 3rd floor. Very friendly throughout the trip. I think the key is being friendly to them and giving mutual respect. They will do anything for you if you ask with a smile. When you demand, I can imagine things can turn sour. The room was nice. It was very clean and we had plenty of room. The beds are doubles pushed together. I discovered the water in the sink and bathtub is salty which leads me to believe its filtered sea water so of course it is undrinkable. They supply you with large bottles of water so you can brush your teeth and drink good water. I would have preferred fresh water from my showers but it wasn't a deal breaker. I heard the Riviera Maya is similar. The hotel is not designed for ocean view. You will likely not get one unless you go full suite. This is the ONLY reason we will probably try another hotel next time. both rooms would get ice cold if you wanted it that way. No issues with the A/C at all. Ours was 2065. You had your choice of Brandy, Jose Cuervo Gold, Vodka and Bacardi Rum in your room bar. Room service was very good and fast! Food- We did Krystals and Myagi. They had a birthday cake waiting for me for dessert at Krystals. That was a nice touch. The food was pretty good. We all had 4 different entrees. The salmon was the best choice. The filet was okay but just okay. The appetizers were nothing to write home about and the watermelon, basil, tomato foam was awful. Myagi was a disappointment as I am a big Japanese food fan, having lived abroad for several years in the far east. Can't recommend it. The main buffet was very good with a lot of choices. We figured out that it was better than the theme resturaunts and stopped making reservations for them. The beach was phenominal. You can actually tell when you cross property lines while walking the beach because they actually sift the sand in front of the resort to remove shells. It is virtually like walking on cotton. The water was 4 shades of blue and beautiful. There was no problem finding chairs at any time of day. Talking to some people who stayed at the Riveira Mayan, and were visiting our property, ours was more relaxing, fewer college kids and plenty of room. The service at the hotel was unbelievable. Always a smile, tipping or no tipping, they treated us like royalty. My friend got sick one night. We asked about chicken soup. They didnt have any but quickly offered to make some and bring it to him in the room. They all asked about him all evening long. I recommend buying or bringing your own insulated mug as the glasses they serve drinks in at the bars are very small. They will fill whatever you give them up to the top, no problem. We figured this out on our 3rd day. Entertainment at night was lame. We watched anyway. The Michael Jackson show as probably their best show but even then, the stage was not much bigger than an elementary school auditorium stage. Not much room for the dancers to move around on. I would say they don't put a lot of effort in their entertainment, relying on the beach and other attractions to carry the weight. We did the lobster dinner cruise from the El Dorado Marona (?) and it was amazing! The first part, with the catamaran ride along the coast was okay but when we got back to the beach around sun set, they had our own private dining table, seperated from everyone by white cloth, right on the beach. They served us drinks, and a truly amazing dinner while a saxaphone player played romantic music for us. Highly recommend it. Overall, while you can find a more updated hotel, you won't find a better beach, better service, friendlier staff and a cleaner resort. We all had a great, relaxing time and though we will explore a different resort option to get ocean view, would recommend this to friends and family. By the way, the gym was usually empty, but had enough new looking equipment that you can get a decent workout if you want to.", "Date": "June 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cLOVED IT\u201d", "Author": "lock8527", "ReviewID": "UR68238202", "Content": "My husband and I went for his birthday.

Overall we really enjoyed our stay in this Riu. The service was very good. The property and grounds are very clean and very well maintained. The beach is very nice too. There were no palapas, but lots of shade from the palm trees. The restaurants are very good too, even in the main buffet there was always lots of good food to eat. There was even a chocolate fountain every night. We always got a great service at all restaurants and bars. No line ups, no waiting. The rooms are kept very clean. I agree with the majority of the positive reviews here, this is a great hotel. We had several activities and excursions. We went to Chitchen Itza -it was great and worth 2.5 hours ride one way. We also went to Xplor for the whole day. It was just amazing (if you are in your 20-40), I highly recommend this place. It is very well organized, safe and very well thought out. I was impressed, very \"user-friendly\"! We also went to Dolphinaris [---] to swim with dolphins. This was also great! Now the negative. Overall, we had a great vacation, however I do not think I would recommend this hotel to honeymooners. The purpose of our trip was our honeymoon, we got married two weeks ago and have chosen Riu to stay at because we wanted more luxury and better service. Our travel agent requested upgrades for our honeymoon. Upon arrival I presented our marriage certificate and we were told that we are given a free upgrade, however it turned out to be a regular room with two twin beds pushed together. I went back to reception to ask them what exactly did they upgrade and was told that we have the room facing towards the courtyard and not the exterior of the hotel. The view was nice, but that was about it. And on top of that the was a very strong mould smell, like if that room was not used for a long time. This is my 10th trip to an all-inclusive South destination and I have never smelled such a strong (I mean really strong, I do not over exaggerate!) moisture odor, not even in the 3 stars hotel! There is a review here that mention the same, I did not really believed until I experienced it myself. The only other special treatment that we got was a plate of fruits in our room on our 3rd day. There was two apples, one banana and some grapes. This was it! Maybe it was just our luck, and maybe other people get more for there special occasions (I have seen a guest that was given a huge cake at the restaurant because it was his birthday), but I felt that my honeymoon was neglected and no one really cared much, we were treated like anyone else, even though a honeymoon is once in a lifetime experience, even if people do re-marry sometimes, I do not think it is as magical the second time. I feel happy for those that got VIP treatment for their special occasions, but I do warn you, it is not guarantied! Actually, we met a couple on the plane, that got married the same day as us and they went to another resort in Riviera Maya and got much more for their honeymoon than us!", "Date": "June 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cOur best Riu Hotels holiday to date.\u201d", "Author": "Ge0rgeFrederic", "ReviewID": "UR67521857", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Riu Palace Mexico for 14 nights from 11th May 2010. We would like to express our sincere thanks to Maria, the Hotel Director, to Laura, Katy and Ernesta of the reception desk staff and to all the Hotel staff for making this holiday our best Riu Hotels holiday to date. In our opinion, this hotel is a model for how a hotel should be run. Hows this for a welcome service? The scent of a huge bouquet of fresh flowers in our room greeted us when we entered after checking in, and shortly after, a waiter brought to our room a plate full of delicious strawberrys coated in chocolate specially prepared by one of the Chefs. Our Room. We were given one of the best suites in the hotel, with a beautiful view from the balcony overlooking the pool area, beach and the ocean. Everything in the room functioned perfectly from the quiet air conditioning and ceiling fan to the 32\" widescreen LCD TV. The room service was impeccable. Towels changed daily, rooms cleaned promptly and thoroughly (thank you Cristobal) and even a turn down service to tidy our beds whilst we were having Dinner. Although we never availed ourselves of it, there is room service to eat in your room if you desire. Every day we returned to our room we would find intricate displays of towel art and bed decoration crafted by Cristobal. The room safe was a digital safe, very easy to operate and of a size to fit a standard Lap-Top PC. The mini bar was restocked every two days. Drinking water is made available in two sizes of bottle. Small 750cc bottles handy for taking out on trips and larger 1.5 litre bottles for keeping in the fridge. The optics in the room dispense branded liquors and not local brands, ie Smirnoff Vodka and Bacardi Rum. The hotel public areas look really \"classy\" with magnificent crystal chandeliers in the foyer. The grounds are truly beautiful, having an avenue of tall mature coconut palm trees flanking a series of fountain sprinkled pools leading down to the pool area. A real pleasure to walk along in the early morning sunshine on our way to the breakfast buffet. The food for all meals was very good with lots of variety in the Buffet Restaurant. The speciality resaurants also served very good food but the choice of dishes was limited to about three or four options for the main dinner course. The Krystal Restaurant is the most popular and was our favourite closely followed by the Steak House by the beach. We did not eat in the Japanese Restaurant as we do not like sea food. Again how's this for service? Carlos, the manager of the Steak House would arrange for me to have two steaks when I declined the \"Surf\" sea food option for my \"Surf and Turf\". He also sent out to one of the other restaurants for a specially made up fruit dessert dish for my wife after she declined those on offer on the menu. Booking for the speciality restaurants is simple. There is a member of staff available to take your booking in the theatre, which we did before breakfast. Dinner times are 6.30 and 8.30 pm. The popular Krystal restaurant gets fully booked very quickly. The pool area is prettily landscaped with lots of trees and bushes. The pool is in two semi circles, being split by the footpath leading to the beach. Sometimes we struggled to find vacant sun loungers beside a parasol as selfish people would get up at the crack of dawn and reserve them with their towels and then do the same with sun loungers on the beach. The pool is clean and the water warm (warm by UK standards) The beach has been restored and is now a beautiful wide white soft sandy beach. Please note that the sea is quite rough for swimming. Additional palm trees have been planted on the beach but they offer no shade as they have not branched out yet. There are no parasols on the beach and the shady parts under the trees soon get taken. You won't go thirsty on the beach or beside the pool as there is a waiter service to order and bring you drinks. There is a Childrens Club with a dedicated childrens play area, amusements and childrens pool. There is also a fitness suite close to the dive and watersports centre on the beach. The entertainment we found was of a higher standard than that provided at the Riu Club Hotels, the adjacent Riu's Tequila and Yucatan. We loved the dance themed shows such as the Mexican Show with the ladies in lovely coloured Mexican dresses, also the Mariachi musicians show. The musicians were first rate. Would we go back to the Riu Palace Mexico? Yes without a doubt. We intend to book a holiday for the same time next year. Would we recommend this hotel? Yes without a doubt. Our son and his fiancee are going to the Riu Palace Mexico in September 2010 on our recommendation and, having seen our photographs, our next door neighbours daughter has booked her wedding at the Riu Palace Mexico for June next year. O'h that reminds me. There is a beautiful traditional church like wedding chapel in the Foyer area if couples do not want a beach or a hotel grounds wedding. It would also be useful for a wedding on a rainy day. The town of Playa Del Carmen is only a $5.00 taxi ride away. It's too far to walk in the hot sun for we older folk. There are lots of shops and some restaurants / bars in the 5th Avenue shopping street. You can also get the ferry to Cozumel from the 5th avenue pier for a pleasant boat ride for about $25.00 return. If you want a trip into Cancun, there are frequent very cheap buses to Cancun from the 5th avenue bus station. We did this and had a day out to the Riu Palace Las Americas and the Riu Caribe where the Manager very kindly let us choose our own room for our next holiday.

I am a \"beach bum\" literally as I have traveled to Cancun/Riveria Maya for over 20 + years now. I've done all the excursions long time ago, now I can relax at the resorts and enjoy the relaxation of a well deserved vacation. The beach is literally beautiful and for this is why I select Cancun. I was there in 2009 in March- Iberostar Tucan and October- Iberostar Quetzal, and will return to Iberostar Q, in September 2010 (booked already beginning of this year) The beach water no longer has the beached whales/huge black bags of sand in the ocean, this was from about five years ago from Hurricane Wilma. They renovated the beach in early January 2010, after I left in October. RIU had an awesome beach before the renovation but some of the resorts literally had no beach, with the ocean directly hitting the walls of the hotels. Like Occidental and Royal Hideaway. Today all the way into town to the Nightclub Blue Parrot has a huge beach front now, great! You can have your pick on the beach/sand of your choice under any Palm Tree at the RIU Mexico. With the exception of closer to the water the Palm Trees are very small with no shade. They were tied up (palm trees) to grow. I was there every a.m. and saw the crew cut the dried palms away, which were holding in place the new palms - and the Trees blossomed-opened up. But they still are small. Further back is where I stayed daily. The water is simply paradise deep shades of the most beautiful blue water ever. In all my years I have never seen so many sea shells. Conche shells were washing ashore every day, I never saw this. Those are the huge shells, and a lot of small shells. Since they renovated the beach, the ocean now has a lot of small rocks upon entering into it. So be careful with your feet, nothing to big, but you can hurt yourself. Use Caution. The last three days the ocean was really rough. High waves and the water will take pull you out and sideways and take your suit off. Watch for the red flags. The resort is quiet, not your resort for nightlife. I liked it for this. Along with seeing the same people was a +. The rooms are typical rooms with a sofa and thank goodness a dresser for clothes. A fridge with soda, water, and beer and the wall dispenser in all RIU's of liquor. You can not see the ocean from any single room, so no need to upgrade to any \"ocean front room\" at all. A + if it rains you can access the lobby through the buildings which are connected, no need to get wet, but the rooms have umbrellas. You have to make reservations (I don't like doing this everyday) to eat at the theme restaurants. 8:15am they hand out a number and @ 8:30 they begin to give out a piece of paper with a confirmation to dinner. It seemed as there was no problem arriving after the above times. They have Brazilian, Steak House, French, and Japanese. It was all good. The main bar is open from 10:00am til 7:00am which is located upon entering into the resort. Huge beautiful chandeliers. You can visit directly next door to the \"Yucatan\" and across the street to the \"Tequila\" and on the beach down a little way to the \"Playacar\" and the other \"RIU Riveria Maya Palace\" Only the palace's can visit all of the above - the other resorts guest can not come to the Palace's. The \"Tequila\" has a sports bar with over 155 channels to watch any sports event. I was there over three nights watching the Champions \"Black Hawks\" Hockey - Chicago! This place is very loud with a lot , a lot of teenagers, kids. The whole resort of \"Tequila\" is so over crowded with to many people and so is the \"Yucatan\". \"Tequila\" does not have a beach, they have to come across the street to the RIU Palace Mexico directly next door to sunbath. A golf cart brings them over and back. The weather is so very hot! Hot! If you go to the Ruins think twice about going. You have to take water and mosquito spray. Away from the ocean is extremely hot, no relief. The swimming pool is very nice with tiled flowers on the bottom. The water is hot, not cool at all. The coffee is no good, they have a Starbucks directly across the street. It is safe to go to Cancun, town is not far away at all, a cab ride is $5.00 each way. I had a massage in the spa. Most other resorts the massage therapist come around and try to sell, not this resort. As a matter of fact the girls at the front desk at the spa are not friendly, as I went in there three times before I booked. I even went to another resort to inquire as I didn't fell comfortable at the RIU spa. But no one was around at the other resort, so I wound up at the RIU. One last note please TIP these very very hard workers. They work very very hard, it is a very hot climate they have to wear jackets and long pants. You can see the sweat falling from their faces. This breaks my heart, I always tip them, everyone. Go to the bank and take single dollars with you to pass out. You will see a very huge smile from the employees. I did not get to know any of the employees as I usually do. It did not seem as the employees at this resort were so happy, not all but some. Not bad at all and I would go back and recommend this hotel.

Our room was on the 2nd floor ( hotel has 3 floors). Entering our room it was very fresh and clean, our room was not ocean view but was garden view and we had our own private balcony to chill out after long days. On our 1st night we went to Don Julian Buffet and it was very impressive, great variety, high quality dinning. There is so much to pick from its even hard to start!! Service at the hotel was amazing, ive never seen such good costumer service and i work with costumer service soo i would definetly know!! At the buffet theyre is a outside dinning area and inside. We sat outside in the same spot everyday, our server was absolutly spectacular, his name is IGNACIO. After dinner there was entertainment, live music , Circus night, Micheal Jackson night, Movie night, Mariachi Show, Tropical show etc. All shows were GREAT! Christian a young guy in the entertainment was absolutley hilarious!!! The pool area was great aswell, awesome pool bar, many activities in the pool aswell, i really recommend the scuba diving lessons , its in the pool but its alot of fun, made me want to take the scuba diving lessons! The beach was absolutley breathtaking, amazing blue water, white sand, simply amazing!! Service at the beach was awesome too, you just lay back and relax and they bring you drinks! The hotel restaurants: Krystal was okay, im not into fine dining but i cant say it was bad, i still perfer the buffet soo i went there after! Brazilian Steak House: Meat was delicious, however its more of a place to taste diffrent meats, i also went to the buffet afterwards! I did not go to the japanise restaurant. For those of you who do not know, when you book at any palace you can go to any sister hotels. We had access to the Riu Palace riveria maya, Riu tequila, Riu Yucatan,Riu Lupita and Riu Playacar. I stopped by all of them except the riu lupita.

We travelled with Thomson Holidays and were met by our travel rep at the airport. He took us straight to our air-conditioned coach and we waited for a few other people and were off on the hour transfer down to Playacar. The transfer rep had cold Corona's and soft drinks for sale on the coach, which was very refreshing and quite reasonable in price. We did hear of some people on other coaches assuming it was free because they had booked an all inclusive Holiday\u2026.. if some people had half a brain they would be dangerous!! Check in at reception was fast, efficient and easy with Guillermo. Once in our room we found it had a courtyard and side pool view. Great location, as it was closer to the beach and pool rather than reception and the lobby. The room as in most palace hotels had two double beds pushed together and looks exactly like the one in the Thomson Brochure. There was a sunken seating area with flat screen TV with satellite channels. You can't see the sea from any of the rooms due to the palm trees between the hotel and the sea. Our maid was fantastic and the beds were made with clean sheets every day. There were always plenty of drinks left in our fridge daily and any of the spirits changed should they be running low. The beach, now it has been restored again is back to pre-hurricane is amazing. Really nice blue waters and white sand. There are palm trees everywhere should you want a little shade and plenty of sun loungers. There are 2 restaurants within moments of the beach for lunch if you don\u2019t fancy a walk to the main restaurant. Alternatively you can also use the snack bar for the beach club (RIU Tequila) or the RIU Yucatan. The beach was really clean and there is beach bar under the palm trees. It wasn't too crowded on the beach, but we were out there in lower season. There were 2 Pools. One with the swim up bar. This is where the water activities take place and the other pool, across from the seating area which was a lot quieter. This is though a Palace hotel so the activities are a lot more low key than in the Club Hotels next door. I can't say enough about how good the food was, with a great selection on offer in the buffet restaurant that varied every evening at every meal. We went to each of the themed restaurants. Krystal was our favourite again here and we least liked the La Bodega, the meats were calved table side and were rather pink without the option to have them cooked how you would want them! The evening entertainment here is probably some of the best quality we have seen in any of our stays in RIU and RIU Palaces. The dancers are amazing pulling off their sometimes complicated choreography perfectly. The service in the hotel was outstanding. All the staff were so friendly and they all spoke very good English. We never waited long for a drink or our food. Tipping is certainly not expected in the hotel, but we did tip for our waiters and our maid and mini bar man. Our maid $1 a day, the mini bar man the same and the waiters between $5&10 at the end of the 2 weeks depending on how often they had served us. We never felt that service would have been different tipping or not. We really enjoyed our stay and will definitely return in the future!!", "Date": "June 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ontario can.", "Title": "\u201cLETTER TO THE RIU MGMT. SPAIN. & OTHERS\u201d", "Author": "baglady", "ReviewID": "UR66192670", "Content": "I am writing this on Trip Advisor as when it comes to the reviews the RIU head office does not acknowledge or really read the reports but I KNOW THEY READ THIS SITE. First and foremost I like the Riu chain and will more than likely return. We were there for under two weeks and we stayed at the Riu Palace Mexico but have stayed at MANY other Riu\u2019s including this resort many times. In talking with other repeat guests we have come to the conclusion that the management in Spain are more concerned about the new and grand openings of their New Babies they forgot about the other children. What about \u201cWE\u201d the traveller that likes the older ones why are we penalized because we don\u2019t want to get on the band wagon following the new Riu\u2019s Things that are going wrong with older Riu\u2019s are, the moisture leaking through the floors and when you go to bed these beds are extremely damp and you have to put the big blue blanket down to keep the moisture from coming through to your body, so uncomfortable, ( I would compare it to sleeping in a leaky camping tent when it rains) not to mention the plastic mattress protector that causes sweating. We wanted to tear the bed apart. At this point I am extremely worried about the mould. The Riu rule is do not turn the air conditioners on till the guests are due to arrive. Therefore while the room is empty the moisture grows and so does the mould. There is no ventilation in bathrooms and in the shower you can see the white grout on the walls growing black mould. The backing of the mirror is damaged from the moisture. The sinks are chipped and marked, with the taps pitting. Around the toilets and behind are never cleaned properly all the time we were there. The mirrors are wiped down and all streaky with a soap film and you can\u2019t even see properly, ever heard of Windex?? Another complaint from a guest was in the suite the little couch had plastic in it and the moisture from the room was absorbed by the fabric of the couch and therefore after sitting there a bit you realize the couch is wet!!!! Because the mould is so bad the clothes in the drawers and closets smell far worse than they ever have. Wouldn\u2019t if make more sense to run the air conditioners on low continually and ventilate the bathrooms instead of having to replace tile and fixtures. Money wise I believe it is a cost saving enterprise, that is what we do in our homes. Next if you don\u2019t want to clean /bleach the grout in the floor tiles use coloured grout then the dirt will not be noticeable. Also when putting down these floors there is a sealant that can be used over it. Doors leading to the buildings are broken and remained broken throughout our visit. The walkway tiles are chipped broken and cracked. With ice machines it like a game of wonder which one will be working today?????? Food, very disappointed in the lunch restaurant by the pool. It was the same every day. To get any meat well it just wasn\u2019t there except for hot dogs, hamburgers, or chopped up beef or chicken to make fajitas and then it was just left of meat from the dinner before. I have never seen a Palace lunch so pathetic. You pay more to stay there but you are better off paying less eating better at the other resorts. The Yucatan\u2019s on going sewer problem is like the oil spill in the gulf, nothing is working to fix it. The lunch restaurant reeks from the smell coming from the washrooms and septic tanks. Pools, slop job on the painting, there should be inspectors that get in the pool themselves and have a look under the edge it is black and gross. The paint is splattered on the blue tiles and they too have mould in the grout, a brush would get rid of that. My advice to the Riu people if you don\u2019t want to lose more clients to the Iberostars start taking care of what you got properly instead of seeing how many more place you can open. Pretty soon you will tick off your faithful and they won\u2019t even go to the new ones. Maybe it\u2019s the new young fresh management in Spain that you are putting too much faith in what happened to old school. In closing I want to say that the management and employees at the resorts are outstanding, we could not be happier with the way they treat us. They have to listen to all the complaints and handle it with dignity and I know it must be hard for them, their hands are tied. They can\u2019t go and repair tiles or change orders sent down by Spain. Take these executive people and secretly send some to each Riu in Mexico for a week in one room to sleep, bath, then to use all other facilities and report back. It is not the staff it IS THE FACILITIES. If you want to run a low budget resort cut your prices because your resorts are becoming budget calibre.", "Date": "June 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newbury", "Title": "\u201cGreat Wedding!\u201d", "Author": "michelleandandy11", "ReviewID": "UR65947050", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for 2 weeks in mid May and had a great time! We were apprehensive before travelling, having read a number of negative reviews on here, but throughout our stay we came to realise just how unfounded these negative reviews were. The rooms are a good size with a separate living area and balcony. In some rooms there is a slight musty smell but no worse than in other resorts by the sea in hot countries. We had a courtyard-facing room which was great, the view of the fountains was beautiful, would definately recommend one of these rooms. The beds were huge and we didn't find them hard at all. The rooms were cleaned daily and then there was a turn down and mini-bar filling service each day too. One pointer would be to put the 'do not disturb' sign on your door in the evening and keep it there until you want to get up - the cleaners have a habit of going into your room very early otherwise! The food was great, all buffets had a good choice and speciality restaurants were lovely. Our favourite was the Japanese one but others in our group preferred the Fusion and the Steak House. Drinks were unlimited wherever you went which was great - with your glass being re-filled whenever it was half empty. The beach was stunning, plenty of loungers in either shaded or sunny areas and beautiful turquoise sea. People from the bar come round all the time with a tray of iced cocktails, beer and soft drinks. They came around so often that we found we were refusing 2 or 3 drinks in a row! This was the same by the pool - which was also lovely We got married in the kiosk by the fountains at the resort and everything went very smoothly. We had a meeting with our wedding co-ordinator the day after we arrived and sorted out all details then, and everything on the day was exactly as we wanted it to be. We had a brilliant time and it was so much simpler than trying to organise something similar in the UK We went on 2 trips while we were there - to Akumel and Xcaret. Akumel was great value for money and well worth doing, a taxi costs around 300 pesos and then for 25 USD you can get a boat snorkelling trip and equipment hire. We saw 6 or 7 giant turtles which was amazing, and some rays too. Xcaret wasn't such good value for money at 69 USD, but was still well worth a visit as there is so much to see.", "Date": "May 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "buffalo, ny", "Title": "\u201cjust beautiful!\u201d", "Author": "laceysu", "ReviewID": "UR64772483", "Content": "My husband and I just returned from the Riu Palace Mexico after one fantastic week.

The dinner buffet was just as fabulous, and they changed the theme nightly. We also tried two speciality restraurants, and was also very pleased.

FANTASTIC!! We were able to check into our room right away after great service from the front desk. We had a gardenview room. We had two beds that were pushed together but made up as one bed. It was great! It was like being together yet having great space to sleep. The beds weren't that hard as some people have noted. I have a plush pillowtop bed at home and did not find the bed uncomfortable at all. Pillows were wonderful too! The cleaning staff are very hard working so we tipped him the day before we left. He always had our bed decorated with flower petals and was a nice touch. The beach is HUGE! Tons of loungers but not much shade on the beach. The beach is very well taken care of. There is a large area that has palm trees all over with loungers so you can enjoy the sand while having some shade. There is also an area with about 5 hammocks which is a nice place to relax too. There are two pool areas. One is the activity pool with the swim up bar and the other is a quieter area. Both with loungers and umbrellas. We never had a problem finding any spots to relax. There are no decending stairs to get into the pool, only ladders. There really isn't anywhere to sit or lay back in the pool on the quiet side. The activity pool has a ledge aroun d but I'm not sure how long it is. We never got around to the a la carte restaurants and just ate at the buffet for dinner. Many, many choices for everyone. The breakfast is always my favorite! There are three areas for lunch/snacks. The main buffet restaurant is opne from 12:30-3:30 (roughly) but we always at at the one that is close to the pools. There is a small shopping area within walking distance of the resort. It's about 3 minutes away. Every night around 8:45 there was a 10 minute Mayan show that was pretty cool to see. Be careful of pricing. Many stores in this area as well as in Playa del Carmen have the same items for sale for many different prices. Look around first and try to remember where you saw the cheapest price. I saw something in one store for $40, then $25 in another, and $11 in another!! Free wireless internet is available in the lobby and lobby bar if you bring your own laptop, otherwise you have to pay if you use theirs.

My wife and I stayed in a standard room. We've been to the Riu Palace Mexico back in Nov. We've been coming to Playa del Carmen or Playacar (the gated resort section where the Riu Hotels are) for 13 years and have stayed at 6-7 other hotels. Lobby: Elegant and clean! (See photo) Check-in desk staff was efficient and helpful. Any problems (like needing more hangers, or another bottle of Rum) were taken care of promptly (one call usually took care of problem). Beach: Recently repaired: no more \"beach whales\" you may have heard of. Beach is wide and deep. Only about 435 rooms worth of guests share a very large beach area, compared to some other hotels 700-800 rooms' guests sharing a smaller beach area. (Makes it less crowded). Beach is raked several times a week, making the sand soft and powdery, and clean. There has been some seasonal trimming of the front four rows of palm trees, so that they don't offer much shade, but in the tropics plants grow back quickly. Grounds: Very elegant! Well manicured and beautifully maintained. The central fountains, and reflecting pond bordered by tall palm trees that runs down the center of the resort, separating the two 3-story guest room wings of the resort, are visually magnificent! (See photos.) Rooms: spacious, with a step-down sitting area with loveseat, dresser, and flat screen t.v. 10'-12' tall ceilings. Safes, ironing board, booze dispenser, fridge with beer and pop, full size umbrellas are in every room. Each room has its own a/c thermostat and ceiling fan. Bathrooms are adequate, but not oversized (with tub). Toilet and bidet are in their own small room. Food: the ala carte restaurants are attractive and the food is pretty good....... particularly for meat eaters. There is Miyagi Japanese, Krystal Fusion, La Bodega Brazillian (Meats!), and Steakhouse (El Patio during the day). The Buffet (Don Julian), we found, offered a wonderful assortment of seafood, pasta, meats, salads, soups, and desserts. We loved the variety of the buffet so much that it was our favorite place to eat (serving till 10:30). For the ala cartes there is a reservation system that starts at 8 a.m. (Ask about it when you check in.) Buffet requires no reservations, but long pants, and sleaved shirts are required at dinner (also true at ala cartes). Bars: pretty wood-paneled lobby bar serves premium liquor until the early morning hours. Nice wait staff. Pool bar (open til 6 p.m.) Beach bar (til 5 ) Pool: it's okay, but not as colorful, or as tropical as some of the other Riu resorts' pools. There is reciprocity at any of the other Riu Resorts pools, bars, or restaurants (EXCEPT not for dinner) Offered by Riu Palace only. Gym: small, but has most popular machines (2 treadmills, some free weights, stairclimber, exercise bikes.) Located next to spa near pool. Entertainment: Evening shows in the lounge, and small bands with a singer many nights in the gazebo/courtyard area outside of the lounge. Kids: Riu Palace does have programs for little kids, but I have noticed that the families that come here seem to have fewer children per family than other resorts. Guests: on our two visits here I noticed that most visitors are Europeans, Canadians, Russians, Mexicans, Latin Americans, and about 15% U.S. There are 35% 60-year-olds, 30% 40's, 25% in their 30's, & 10% 20/70's Service: excellent. Workers are friendly (for the most part) and work very hard for low wages. Small tips (a dollar or two) help them out a lot. . Town visit: worth the 5-minute $5 cab ride (each way). 5th Avenue is a pedestrian walkway lined with shops, restaurants, bars, and...salesmen (some are a bit assertive...just smile and walk past those guys). Fun visit. Hints: we take insulated 18-oz. drinking mugs (with tops) to keep our beach beer and drinks COLD. Mini-umbrellas also protect against unexpected tropical showers. We also take medical aids (immodium, bandaids,aspirin, insecticide, etc) to save the expense and hassle of a doctors visit ($120) for something minor.

We got good exchange rates at the hotel.The best part is that you can use all the other Riu Hotels in the area except for evening meal and breakfast. The Carribean Sea was absolutely wonderful and when we relaxed we used the beach instead of the pool area, I found that the motor sports were expensive compared with the Mediteranian 36 Pounds for Parascending behind a boat - they tell tou it is for half an hour but when timed you are lucky to get 8 minutes.

Manitees or the diving bell - these were all extra. It is a great day out - best trip we have been on so far good for children and adults - and we would certainly do it again. We used to walk into PlayaCar along the road approx 30mins and walk back along the beach, by Taxi it is 5 Dollars or 50 Peso's (Peso's is cheaper than Dollars). We were also advised to change money for Peso's (Not Dollars) If you walk into a shop the general rule of thumb is not to haggle, however, if you are invited in to the shop expect to haggle to pay roughly half of the price on the label.

The hotel was absolutely stunning and the staff was amazing. They all went above and beyond to make their customers happy. The staff was very professional and classy. We arrived to a smooth check in and very greeted with a refreshing fruit juice. The rooms were roomy and the sitting area was a nice touch. The only thing I would suggest is if you have small children or an early bed time, ask for a room away from the theatre and the courtyard area where the band plays. It can be a little noisy but it does end by around 11:00 or so. I spend every day by the beach and did not utilize the pool aside from one quick dip. The pool area seemed dramatically hotter than the beach. The pool was slightly chilly. But the pool was not my preference when there is such an AMAZING beach and sea within walking distance. The beach is immaculate and raked and cleaned daily. Plenty of beach chairs at any time. There was no rushing down to save your chair in the early morning like other hotels I have visited. The only thing that I can say someone may complain about is the lack of night life on site. But there are other RIU's within walking distance with more to do at night. I was not affected by this as I did not go to party and simply wanted lots of relaxation and a beautiful beach. I would also say that if you are traveling with children that this might not be the place for you. Not really anything for kids to do that I could see and there were very few kids at the hotel.

Very nice and spacious with a lovely view of the pool and gardens, very comfortable beds and sun loungers on the balcony. Nice bathroom with loo with a separate door which was a good touch.

This is something we look forward to each year. We stayed at the RIU in Negril, Jamaica 2 years ago and were very impressed with that property. We decided to try the RIU Mexico Palace in Playa del Carmen this year. What a disappointment this RIU was. After the 60 minute ride from Cancun's airport (we had to make a stop and drop another couple off at a different property), we were assured by the bellman that our luggage would be brought in to us. We were greeted by an enthusiastic front desk team. After getting to our rooms, 2 girls in our group discovered that they had someone else's luggage. It took about 90 minutes for the hotel to track their luggage and deliver it to them. The pool was another disappointment. There was a sludge of suntan oil, dead bugs and hair floating in the water. Bleech! Aside from the ladder, there were no other steps to get into the pool. Unfortunately one of our friends was still recovering from knee surgery and had a hard time getting in and out. The food was mediocre at best. Very over-salted. Breakfasts were good though. (Kinda hard to screw up breakfasts though.) I DON'T recommend the Brazilian restaurant. The service was slow. We also noticed that the wait staff didn't stop by tables more than once with the meat unless there were men at the table. There really wasn't any nightlife at the hotel. No disco. They did a kids show each evening at the martini bar that opened into the courtyard. While we had after dinner drinks, we were regaled with \"Head and Shoulders, Knees and Toes\" and \"Simon Says\" each night. After that, the RIU had a music group that sounded like a wedding band that played in the courtyard each night. There were some positives. The sleeping room and bathroom were a good size. We loved our patios (although one room's patio was quite a bit smaller than the others). We enjoyed going next door to the RIU Yuccatan. Overall, I can't wholeheartedly recommend the RIU Mexico Palace.

This was the best vacation we had to date. We enjoyed every moment of our stay, from the amazing setting of the hotel, with wonderful gardens and fountains, luxurious lobby, excellent room, to the incredible staff and level of service. We never waited for anything, and it was always enough just to ask. The room was excellent, quiet (1017, facing the back of hte left wing) and very spacious. The air conditioning was very quiet too - this has been an issue for us when travelling to other destinations - and also there was a thermostate in the room so we had control over the temperature. The room also has a terrace, a fully stocked bar with rum, vodka and whisky (we are not drinkers but we can appreciate quality - they were all very good!) and a fully stocked fridge with water, soft drinks and beer. The room cleaning staff was excellent (thank you Lorenzo for all your hard work and artistic touches! very cute towel creatures) and the room was done at least 2 times during the day - we did not even have to turn the bed for the night! The serving staff at the buffet restaurant was great - Ignacio is the best, very polite, pleasant manner and very good recommendations, and Fabiola - at breakfast - really nice. There are always special touches, and the staff is always trying to remember what we liked and provide it, be it the wine or the choice of coffee. The selection is huge, there are always at least 3 types of meat and lots of sides to choose from, some nights there are special dishes too, and overall we did not feel the need to go to any a la carte - there was plenty of variation. The quality of hte food was top notch, both my husband and I have sensitive digestion but this was very well cooked and very tasty. The rest of the hotel staff was also extremely nice, always smiling, constantly cleaning and aranging everything so it looked impecable all the time. All the positive comentaries you read here are true, we did not have one single thing that was disappointing. We did 2 trips - Xcaret and Chichen-Iza, very good both of thm, both provided by Sunquest. The guide we had for Chichen-Iza was very knowledgeable - Eduardo - and funny - we had a good couple of laughs on the trip. The Cenote - Ik-kil - was awesome, very refreshing. We also walked to Playa del Carmen one afternoon, it is very safe and the promenade is very nice, all the villas, hotels and landscaping - beautiful. The beack is excellent, visible they have restored it recently - beautiful sands and the bottom of hte sea smooth and no stones or shells. The water was warm, crytal clear and one day we had high waves, but the rest the waves were just right. Lots of shade - we are always staying in hte shade - but a big stretch under the sun too, with many beach beds available at all times. Drinks are brought around frequently, but the bars are really close too if something more sofisticated is needed. As you can tell, the enthuziasm did not wear off yet. This was the first time we did not want to come back, that is how much we enjoyed this vacation.

The lobby had closed off air conditioning which was very nice when its very hot outside. The Front desk was helpful and if you needed any assistance or help they took care of it. The Hotel said that they had wireless interenet in their lobby but it kept breaking so if you needed to use internet you had to go to another Riu location. The Food was good in the buffet but was practically the same every day. If you have ever been to a Riu before then this hotel won't be a huge difference. The beach had alot of shade as well as alot of sunlight, which was great for our party, because we had both those who spent the day tanning and those who spent the day running away from the sun. The restuarants were good but you had to wake up early to get a reservation. The Bars were good for the most part. They knew most of the drinks and made very good margaritas. sadly they struggled to make any other drink meet expectations with most of them being either too watered down or just plain alcohol. The rooms were mini-suites and large for 2 people. the Tv had around 40 channels with about half in spanish. The service was good for the most part. The beach was very wavy during our 10 day stay and some of our party didn't even enter the water becuase of the waves. The ride from the airport took around 1 hour ( if no traffic) but it took our friends 2 hours due to construction and traffic.

Also took over the beach, again loud - and pretty ignorant to everyone around them. Not the resort's fault. The grounds - amazing just like the other Riu palaces we've been to. Gardeners work very hard, always raking the sand, leaves, debris, picking up anything amiss. Great hard working people - deserve a lot of praise. SPA - simple and nice. Did the daytrip to Tulum and Beyond - got to snorkel in two cenotes, lunch on a secluded private beach and pyramids in the morning - well worth the visit. Go early.

Check-in was very quick, with very efficient reception staff. Must say at the outset that ALL THE STAFF at the hotel are absolutely fantastic and nothing is too much trouble for them and you didn\u2019t have to tip them to get this service (although we did at the end).The grounds are kept immaculate and everywhere was kept so clean but so many staff. This is a very well run hotel. We were allocated a standard room with view of the fountains and it was just what we had hoped for. The room was kept spotless by our maid (wish I could have brought her home with me to do my cleaning!). We had breakfast in our room one morning but unfortunately the order got misinterpreted so only ended up with breakfast for one but this was rectified very quickly when the mistake was pointed out with many apologies. So pleased that Riu have now put coffee making machines in the rooms; hope it\u2019s the same for all of their hotels now and not just the \u201cPalaces\u201d. We were always left plenty of bottled water and the mini-bar and fridge were well stocked. Our bed was very comfortable and not hard as some trip advisors have stated. There was a good selection, as is usual with Riu\u2019s, at the breakfast buffet in the Don Julian restaurant and we managed to get a table outside on the terrace every day we wanted to. The staff were very efficient in clearing away so that other guests could eat on the terrace. We also tried the later continental breakfast at La Traviata on one occasion after a jog (hope you\u2019re all impressed!) which also had a good selection. We ate lunch mainly in the El Patio and La Traviata restaurants and once in the Don Julian restaurant. We also ate lunch in the main restaurant at the Riviera Maya twice and do feel that their main restaurant did have a better feel to it than the Mexico\u2019s, hence one of the reasons for sitting outside on the terrace. We ate mainly in the Don Julian buffet restaurant (or should I say on the terrace) for dinner which had a very good selection with wonderful deserts. We also visited the El Patio Steak House 3 times, which was very good, La Bodega Brazilian restaurant, which was ok and the Krystal (gourmet) which we were disappointed with. We visited the Krystal restaurant when staying at the Riu Palace in Aruba and the food in the Aruban Krystal was much better than at the Mexico. We did feel that the arrangement for booking the speciality restaurants was silly; you having to get a numbered ticket at about 8ish and then the numbers were read out starting at 8.30 and with only being able to book for that day. We discovered that the Riviera Maya dealt with this differently; only queuing once and being able to book in advance. There were plenty of sunbeds around the swimming pool and beach area with a good amount of shade if needed. Unfortunately the swimming pool was cold with the sea being warmer. We did prefer the layout of Riviera Maya\u2019s pool area, but it was very noisy and because their pool was nearer the beach you could hear the noise from the pool on the beach. As the beach at the Mexico was a short walk through the grounds it wasn\u2019t at all noisy and was much wider. The beach itself was wonderful being able to walk all the way to Playa del Carmen. The entertainment was better than we have seen in other Rius; it could be improved on, but at least we didn\u2019t feel we had to walk out on anything as we have done in the past. We did visit all of the Riu hotels in Playacar and feel that it is worth that bit extra to stay at the Mexico, especially if you\u2019re a bit older with no children. Not sure if its worth paying even more to stay at the Riviera Maya even though it did have a few extras more than the Mexico. There wasn\u2019t wall-to-wall sunshine every day and some nights it was chilly but that did not affect us. We had a fantastic holiday and felt guilty that we had done very little compared to what we usually do on holiday but we had visited the area before and had \u201cdone\u201d a lot of the sights. As I stated above, everyone made our stay great and we would not hesitate in recommending the hotel.

This resort was so beautiful that I don't know if we can say enough good things about it. The grounds are immaculate and so tastefully decorated. The rooms are very nice as well, but I think that they were given a little less attention as to the decorating. Please don't take that in a negative sense, because that is not what I mean at all. They are still very nice and very clean. I just think they focused more on the outside and common areas, which is just fine with me because we were hardly ever in our rooms. The beds are a little hard and so were the pillows. But I found after leaving just a couple of bucks under the pillow for a tip that first night, the next night we had extra soft pillows. This resort is tucked into the very elegant and private community of Playacar. And it is quite secure. I never felt unsafe. The service is amazing. There is always someone there to wait on you whether at the bars, in the restaurants, room service, you name it! And very friendly as well. We developed a great friendship with one of our pool bar waiters, Hector. What an awesome young man! We plan to keep in touch and maybe someday show him around Michigan. Please say hello to Hector for us from Dan & Laura. The food was outstanding. We actually only ever ate at the buffets because we just never got around to making reservations in any of the restaurants. The choices were endless. We had absolutely no complaints at all. Not even one. And my boyfriend has been a cook for the last 35 years. He was very happy with the food. All-inclusive is the way to go. The mix drinks were a little weak, but then someone suggested that I just ask them for doubles instead. They had no problem mixing doubles for us and they tasted much better after that. There is a liquor dispenser with four types of liquor in the room, as well as a fully stocked mini fridge with beer, pop and water. Any time we asked for more, they always brought it to us. The water in the resort is purified, but not in your room. They still recommend using bottled water to brush your teeth. The beach was very beautiful and clean. There are so many lounge chairs that are both in the sun and the shade, that you never had to save a chair for yourself. There is plenty for everyone. The waiters walk around the beach offering you drinks - how nice! The pools were very nice - a little quiet at times. They do have some activities like water aerobics, but I would have liked to hear a little more music. No rowdy spring breakers here. There were all ages really, from young families to the elderly with a lot of middle age in between. But it was peaceful and fun. We met two really nice couples from Canada right before we left. The resort provides beach towels, so there is really no need to take up room in your suitcase to bring any. They have entertainment every evening. We caught some of it, but not all, as we had gone into town a couple of nights. While it's not Vegas, I'll give them an A+ for effort. When you're a guest at this particular resort, you have rights to go into all of the other Riu resorts in Playacar for entertainment, drinks and meals (excluding dinner), but the other resorts are not allowed to come to this one to drink or eat. Kind of nice in a way. It gives you the opportunity to check out the other resorts and maybe enjoy some of their entertainment, yet it leaves more open chairs for you back at this resort.

I had booked this hotel thinking it was the Riu Palace Riviera Maya (where we had stayed one year ago, and is almost identical, when viewed in pictures, to the Riu Mexico \u2013 thus the confusion). The RP Mexico is a few hotels down from the RP Riviera Maya and is a little older. I prefer the RP Riviera Maya. Our room \u2013 number 0001 \u2013 was ground level, and had the worst musty odor I have ever experienced in a hotel room. Maybe last year\u2019s swine flu epidemic that kept tourists away caused this hotel to shut down some rooms, because that is what this room smelled like \u2013 like it had been closed up for a long period of time. (Note to hotel: throw away the disgusting-smelling sofa in room 0001.) We did not change rooms. Why not? We got there in the late evening and we were tired, and I also believed that the hotel was totally booked. Looking back, I should have changed rooms (if any were available). So, we kept the patio sliding doors slightly open 90% of the week. Luckily, you could safely do this due to locking mechanism. Important note: Riviera Maya is about one hour south of Cancun Airport. Lots of traffic and it's slow. Overall, this hotel (food, service) is very nice. The pool is divided into four separate sections. Access: Unless you just jump in, it is difficult to get into and out of the water. There are ladders, of course, but no graduated stairs or easy access. I saw several elderly people having difficulty getting in and out of pool. Ocean was beautiful, clean and warm. Huge beach area and no problems ever finding chaises either at the pool or beach. Lots of water activities also \u2013 kayaks, sailing, jet skis, parasailing. Drinks are indeed lacking alcohol, unless you ask for extra liquor in your drink. Any frozen drink or welcome drink was really just punch \u2013 which is strange because there is a fully-stocked bar in every room, containing bottles of Tequila, Rum, Brandy, Vodka, water, soda, etc. (all inclusive) Any outdoor eating/entertainment area is open season for smokers. I am a non-smoker, and found this particularly annoying, but recognized this is the way it is. The hotel is approx. 1.5 miles from the Cozumel ferry and 5th avenue shopping. You can walk there safely. I recommend taking the ferry and enjoying the sights on that island. Get ready for the onslaught of vendors and store owners who will drag you into their stores. If you don't want to walk to 5th ave/ferry, a taxi costs $5 one way (that was for 2 of us). On a side note re Cancun Airport: When you arrive and have gotten your luggage and made it through customs, get out of the airport. Go past all of those men/women in tan pants. They are not there to help you get transportation (although that is what they tell you). They want to sell you timeshares. Just get out of the airport. Ignore them all. They are persistent. And realize that once you are out of the airport and into the transportation area, it is pandemonium. Also, on your return to the Cancun Airport, you really do need a 2-3 hour window. Our line for Delta snaked around and took us one hour to get up to the check-in desk. American Airlines check-in area was just as bad, if not worse. Maybe because it was a Saturday, with a high volume of travel. Also, do not come hungry to the airport on your departure.

I was here for my senior spring break! Highly recommended to all! It wasn't as crazy as cancun, but still had the clubs and the city of Playa close by. The taxi was easy to get, the bellhop flagged them down off the street, and we hopped right in. it was $5 each way, and had van available for larger parties. We traveled to the city of Playa 2 times. First to go to senor frogs, which I HIGHLY recommend going too! It was a blast. My friends and I got the \"yard\" margaritas and even took shots with our parents! Definietly a night to remember. A different night we went to Coco bongo which is a night club. We got a \"deal\" and spent $60 per person but we got open bar at the club next door for an hour then v,i.p access into coco bongo, so we didnt have to wait in line. Once we got in, we each recieved 2 tequila shots with a lime. The staff was very fun and pulled us up on stage! it was a blast as well! Back at the resort, I am a picky eater but still found food that was enjoyable. The drinks were available 24 hours a day, either at the 4 different bars OR your liqour dispensers that were in every room! I recommend getting a Mango Tango! it is a fruity drink that is soo good and refreshing! It is an alcoholic beverage but because the drikning age is 18, my friends and I were able to have as much as we wanted! The beach was just recently re-done and was so amazing. The water was clear and warm. The pool was great and of course the swim up bar is unforgetable. We met up with a group from Arkansas that was also there for their senior spring break. The club next door at Riu Teqiula. The club was called La Disco Pinata, it was a blast. sooo much fun, the only thing that i can say was a problem was we went two nights in a row and they played pretty much the same 25 songs both nights, and possbily in the same order. The beach bar was wonderful because you didnt have to go to the pool to get drinks ALSO waiters came arund with cervezas, margaritas, mango tangos, anything all day long. So sometimes you didn't have to move! The staff was extremely helpful and amazing. All the men joked with my friends and I. We know some spanish, so we had some conversations in espanol, though they ended up laughing WITH us, because we weren't very good. The only problem we had with the staff was a women bartender. She was at the lobby bar, and when we asked for Passion Dreams (another drink containing alochol) she didn't put any alcohol in it. She didn't ask for our bracelets or anything. So we were pretty annoyed. Even when our parents went and order the drinks for us, she still didn't put any alcohol in them. I also recommend having a \"Dos Equis\" it is the beer of Mexico and just puts me in a good mood thinking about it! I miss Mexico so much. It was such a blast. I do also recommend wearing a lot of sunscreen, and reapplying every few hours. I tanned before i went so i had a base, but still burned and am now pealing!

The hotel all round was so clean. Food in the main resturant was fantastic and varied, always something to try and had several theme nights a week, all of which presented the tough choice of what to eat, so many great dishes to choose from. Some of the other resturants like the brazilian were very good too and great for a change of scenery if the main resturant is getting too much. Top tip with the currency exchange though, we took US dollar travellers checks and found that the exchange rate was very poor not just to get the checks in the UK but also when we changed them for the Pesos in Playa del Carmen. Best way to get cash is to use the Santander bank which is about a one min walk from the front of the hotel, I think it cost me about \u00a31.50 to use the machine but I got a massive difference in the exchange rate which would have saved us a small fortune over the two weeks.

Feb 17 \u2013 21, 2010 A Riu Palace decorated nicely (I think the RPLA is more elaborate). Front desk warm greeting, Very efficient and helpful. The food is good at the buffets. Very good food selection as with just about any Riu I\u2019ve stayed. There is some themed evenings, but there is also other food available, not just the specific themed food. Only ate at the steak ala carte. My table was decorated so nicely for my birthday. There were flower petals all on the linen along with the lovely hibiscus. They were very attentative and it was such a pleasant dinner. It wasn\u2019t the worst steak, but I also wasn\u2019t expecting outstanding. The room service is the typical Riu menu. Limited, yet adequate. I just love those silly little chicken toasties. They are actually like a tostada. I'll take some of them right now please. I was also told that I could go to the Japanese whenever I\u2019d like. No reservation required. Unfortunately I never made it. Room was a standard palace room. It was located in the center of the resort and faced the trees. It was actually fine. Easy enough to get to beach/pool area or to the front of the hotel. I swear there are only about a million people staffed in housekeeping. It\u2019s not one person per floor, it\u2019s a LOT per floor (or section per floor). Everyone is great and very accommodating. I would not hesitate to return to this Palace. There are so many options of where to lounge. Mind you the pools are somewhat small so that area is limited a bit. There are areas on the outer of the pools. Some are nice and quiet locations too. Umbrellas all over. There are lots of lounge areas on the beach near and further from the waters edge. There is also an area with hammocks. This is a nice serene location plus they are under the palm trees which sound so nice. Bored of sitting around? Walk next door to the Yucatan (I think). Walk around, check it out. Next across the street. That\u2019s where I finally saw the Coati creatures. They are out at the club at night. Got some funny pix of them too. Next walk north a couple hotels to the other Riu (forgot which this one is). I went up here one day and they were having a beach party (during the day). It was fun and the beach was really nice too, except not enough shade. I walked up here to get a massage as I was told by one of them that it was a little cheaper up here. So I thought, why not I\u2019ve nothing else to do. Well worth it too! I would definately recommend this Riu. Something off topic a bit. I booked this hotel thru funjet and the transfers were with Lomas. This included round trip transfers. Problem was that I was heading to another hotel after Riu. They were kind enough to arrange my pickup at my next hotel even though they do not sell the hotel that I was staying at next. I just thought that was a great deal and pretty nice.

I went with my wife just when the peak season is starting (spring break). First, an overview of the Riu's in Playa del Carmen. Riu has 6 hotels located in an area called \"Playacar\". Playacar houses many upscale hotels and condos as well as a golf course on the property. Playacar has security gated entrances, so everyone entering is screened. One of the things I didn't know about the Riu \"Palaces\" is that it is a premium hotel relative to the other Riu hotels. A \"Riu Palace\" guest can go to any other \"Riu\" hotel and resort, but a Riu hotel guest cannot visit the \"Riu Palace\" resorts. We understood the difference when we went to Riu Playacar hotel. Although the level of cleanliness and maintenance were the same, there was much more people at the hotel resorts. The rooms are smaller in size, as well as being closer together at the hotels. The Riu Palace is upscale and spacious. As I mentioned before about the differences between the hotels and palaces, the palaces are more quiet and relaxing. It also seems to cater to the older crowd, and this may be due to the premium pricing. The hotel is less dense which means much less noise. I would come to the Riu Palaces for relaxation and calmness and go to the other Riu's for partying. We got a junior suite on the main floor (which is the least expensive of the hotel rooms you can get). The room was spacious, but we had a view of a fire hydrant and a fenced walkway from our balcony. The open minibar was convenient. It had plenty of water, soft drinks, beer and hard liquor. The room had a safe to lock your valuables in. There is also a nighttime turn down service to restock the minibar. The hotel feels very safe. In fact, we forgot to close our room safe one night. Fortunately, nothing was missing after the room service. The Riu offers a central buffet that has a theme every other day. The Riu also has several specialty restaurants: a Brazilian Rodizio, a Steakhouse, Fusion, and a Japanese restaurant. The annoying thing is that these restaurants need to be booked during specific times. This was an inconvenience as you needed to talk to the Maitre'D if you have an all day excursion (like we did when we went to Chichen-Itza). The food was exceptionally good at the central buffet. The odd thing about the buffet is that the \"Mexican\" dishes are at a separate buffet at the entrance of Don Julian. It was really at the other end of the restaurant and it seemed largely ignored. It had great salsa, guac, and fajitas. We tried the other specialty restaurants out as well. The Asian restaurant Miyagi had disappointing Sushi (but the Asian themed buffet night was tepid as well). Then again, you don't come down to Mexico for the Asian food. The Rodizio, Fusion and Steakhouse were all fine. The food quality was on par with the buffet. I guess the biggest difference is if you want to be served vs. getting up and getting your own plate. The pool at the Riu Palace Mexico is the worst of the Riu's in Playa del Carmen. The pool is not heated, and a little on the cold side. The Jacuzzi is not heated either. The pool has no swim up bar, no built in benches, tables or lounge chairs unlike the other Riu's that I've seen. It does have a gorgeous rebuilt beach, and a shaded area between the pool and beach for lounging in the shade and partial sunshine. I had no problems getting pool/beach lounge chairs or drinks from service people. However, after that being said, the pool was not crowded even with the free scuba lessons going on. The Riu Palace does not have a concierge that I was aware of. All the bookings we did were based off our shuttle company Olympus that provided our transport to and from the airport. We met an Olympus representative at certain times in the lobby to discuss and arrange excursions. There were other tour operators there as well around the same time (Sunquest, Apple). I can't see why you cannot book excursions with the other tour operators if you need to. The nightlife and entertainment at the Riu Palace was OK. The shows were typical \"cruise\" line entertainment shows, but with even lesser budgets and production values. This seemed to satisfy many of the hotel guests. We prefer to go downtown or to another hotel (if you prefer crowds). Downtown Playa del Carmen is a half hour walk from this hotel, but all the hotels in Playacar are a $5 cab ride. Make sure you agree to the price before you get into the cab. There is free wireless internet in the hotel lobby only. The Riu Palace hotel guests seem very international. Riu is a Spanish hotel chain. We met Germans, Nordics, Swedes, Canadians, and Australians. A couple of Americans were there as well, but not as many as I would have expected. Overall, I highly recommend the Riu Palace hotels for everything it offers. I would advise a Riu Palace if you prefer rest and relaxation vs. a regular Riu hotel if you prefer a more active nightlife. I intend to stay at another Riu in the near future.", "Date": "March 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hastings", "Title": "\u201ci am desperate to visit again, just lovely\u201d", "Author": "K_Meister1983", "ReviewID": "UR58901812", "Content": "I stayed for a week at the Riu Palace Mexico with my mum in April 2008.

Rooms are of amble size with a sitting area, good mattress, flat screen TV with sattelite channels.

The sand has come back from any earlier storm damage (there were no sandbags as indicated in some earlier reviews). The disco is across the street at the cheaper Riu Tequilla, which keeps the noise away at night. The staff enthusiastically participated in sports, and was also attentive at restaurants, if a bit less so at the front desk. Drinks have low alcohol content if you order them at the beach, which works out well if you don't want everyone drunk all day. All told, a worthy choice.

We visited first three years ago with another couple and stayed at the Riu Playacar. This time we had 18 people total and booked the Riu Yucatan, as we like the Riu hotels. Upon arrival we were told they were over booked and upgraded our entire crew to the Riu Palace Mexico which was not only a much pricier hotel, but also allowed us to utilize all the Riu's amenities at each of the Riu resorts. The Palace was bigger, nicer, a bit older crowd. The beaches in Playa have all been redone in the past two months so they were very large, whereas when we visited three years ago, after the hurricane, they were sandbagged, small and you could not walk the beachfront from resort to resort. Now we could walk all the way into the downtown Playa area. The waiters brought drink trays to the beach just for the Palace guests and were always very attentive, one step above the other Riu's we have stayed at which were all still very nice. We ate at all the restaurants and everyone had thier favorite picks. We enjoyed fresh lobster the last night of our stay at the buffet. The rooms were large suites with living area's. If you don't put your \"do not disturb\" sign out, expect housekeeping to start knocking at 8am! You can walk into town or take a cab for $5. We took an ATV jungle tour and swam in a cenote for $57 - not sure it was totally worth that much, but was enjoyable none the less. We also took a ferry to Cozumel and rented scooters. We negotiated the price from \"CP rentals\" for $20. A tip - they are negotiable - don't let them try to be sticklers on the prices! The disco was at the Riu Tequila, which was a little inconvenient - they should all have their own. Shows were the same as at every other Riu we have stayed at - Grease, Michael Jackson, game show night. Cheesy fun. It was nice to have the gym and spa on site. We did find massages downtown at Kristines for $25 for a 50 minute massage - several in our group went back for more than one massage. Very good! Was pretty windy and waves were rocky, hard time snorkeling or enjoying water sports. The buffet was ok, along the lines of the other Riu's we have stayed at. We did enjoy the fact that we had 24 hour room service and they were always delivering within 5 minutes. That was a great perk. Another tip - you MUST wear long pants at the restaurants and the buffets. At the other Riu's this was optional - not here!

The Palace Mexico provided a beautiful location. The rooms were very well laid out with a step down sitting area and a flat screen TV about 24\" screen so we could watch the Olympics. The best part was the beach. The Government just finished adding about 100 feet to the beach with about 2 feet of new sand. The beach was picture perfect. There were also many palm trees so you could stay in shade or sun. The green blue water was something out of a picture and swimming was excellent!!! At the Mexico you get a wrist band to visit all the other resorts (Yucatan and Playacar -both on the beach and also the Tequilla and Lupita which are not on the beach). We walked down the beach to Playa Del Carmen and also went by the street - both picture perfect walks and what a gorgeous town!!! All the souvenirs you could want. Did I mention that outside the resort and just down the street a short distance is a Starbucks and a shopping plaza.. Kids thought they had died and gone to heaven. A coffee was 55 pesos or 5 CDN dollars. The second Riu Place Mayan Riviera was located closer to town but not with the other Riu Resorts. Food wise the buffets were excellent. There were four restuarants a la carte: Brazilian, French, Japanese and Steak. All had good food. The beds were a bit hard but we asked for a mattress topper and they were so comfy. Not a true King -two doubles next to each other which was great. In the room was a liquor cabinet with four dispensing bottels of vodka; rum; brandy and tequilla. There was also a bar fridge with pop and Dos XXs beer. If you ran short they would run down and refill - how could you ask for more. The service at the pool and bar was outstanding - always someone by to take an order and clean up.The pool area was quiet, you could get a spanish lesson at the pool side bar everyday at noon; there was a reading library to which I donated some books and also salsa lessons on the beach sometimes with a little band for authenicity. There were a couple of weddings - no wonder as the grounds were impeccably kept (I mean not a leave was allowed to grow before it was snipped). The kids enjoyed the WiFi available in the lobby and if you have to you can bring your computer go to the lobby and connect. However the service was not as fast as in the Burger King in Playa where when you buy anythinng you get a code to link to the system. All in all - our expectations for food, hotel atmosphere, beach with the two teenage daughters (16 and 18) rated as 6 out of 5 were exceeded.

The staff: excellent, always friendly and seemed to love their jobs. The beach: awesome, very large beach area with plenty of chairs for the sun and shade. The ocean: ok. The ocean floor was very sharp with lots of shells. I'd recommend beach shoes in the water. The bars: 1 bartender staffed at most times and they were quite busy and the wait was long. Our rooms: had a horrible funky smell the entire time we were there. It seemed humid in the rooms to the point that my sheets and clothes felt wet but it wasn't really that hot outside. I returned one afternoon to find it hadn't been cleaned yet but the patio door and screen door was wide open. Wasn't happy about that! Used the safe and it worked great. Mini bar was stocked daily. Not sure if the floor in the room got cleaned. My socks were black on the bottom. Location: excellent! Close to 5th ave shopping. Taxi ride was 5.00 one way to shopping. The nightly entertainment at Palace Mexico was horrible! After 2 nights of boring we ventured over to Riu Tequila and their entertainment was excellent and it was packed full of people. The bartenders were great and very quick. We went to the disco at Tequila one night too. The smell in there was horrible. No ventilation at all. We stayed and fun though. Visited Riu Yucatan one evening and watched the Michael Jackson show. It was excellent. The bar was full of bartenders and they were super fun, entertaining and quick. Food: Ate at Don Julian buffet for dinner 2 nights and every morning for breakfast. Breakfast was good and dinner was ok. Highly recommend reserving the specialty restaurants!!! La Bodega: Al carte salad bar and the rest is served at your table. The wait staff comes to your table with large skewers of meat/sea food and they place a piece of each on your plate. Dessert is also served. Left very full! Krystal: Ordered the Salmon for my main entree. Very good. I believe this was another meal with appetizer, salad, main entree and dessert. Miyagi: Awesome! This meal started with sushi and it was great. I'd never had it before. The appetizer I ordered was Tempura - good. Main meal I ordered was the salmon - great and then dessert was served. By far one of my favorite places to eat. El Patio: This is the steak house. It was excellent. Started with large appetizer and salad. Followed by the main meal and dessert. Again...it was excellent.

The Riu Yucatan next door had amazing service staff and we spent most of our time there. This one is located right next door to the Yucatan and across the street from the Tequila where the 24 hour sports bar and disco are. The Riu Mayan Riviera is about a 10 minute walk and a lot busier than RPM. There was a lot more going on around the pool area as well and they have a sports bar there that is air conditioned and was a relief from he heat. The Riu Playacar is next to the Mayan but we didn\u2019t make it in there. The food was terrific and the drinks here were okay. The lining up for the a la cartes is a joke. Even if you are down by 8am to get a number they are already gone so you must have to be waiting at 630am or 7am. We did want to try the Fusion but then heard it wasn't that great. We ended up at the Brazilian and really enjoyed it. The Japanese was also great. The rooms were nice and clean but don\u2019t expect the fancy towel art here (It could be because they weren't fully staffed). We did order room service a couple of times which was nice to have in the morning while getting ready. The Palace\u2019s are usually quieter but you still have access to the other Riu\u2019s.

It was very clean and the food was over all very good. All the staff were very friendly all the time whether you tipped or not. We were not that thrilled with the entertainment at night. We went to Riu Yucatan last year and it was much better. The hall in which it was held was too small. The drinks were plentiful with never having a reason for them to be empty. They also came around on the beach to serve you. There was enough things going on to keep you busy during the day. We met a lot of people from all over the world who seemed to get along well everyday. The drawback was the pool is not as nice or active as the Riu Hotels around there especially the Palace Mayan. The beach is now very beautiful as it is now 500 to 1000 feet deeper with beautiful white cool to the feet coral sand. It was very disappointing to find it closed for the first 2 or 3 days with bulldozers payloaders and excavators working on it day and night. We might not of gone there if we had known it ahead. However if you are going it is now open and probably the best beach around. The palace is definitely better than the other RIUS in the area (excluding Riu Palace Maya) as we checked them all out in the last 2 years. We liked the buffet restaurant the best for food and variety. The Brazilian was also very good as well as the steak restaurant.

The staff, as with the other Riu resorts are wonderful, everyone is mostly very friendly and helpful. The food is, in my opinion, very good. The food is the same at the resorts from Mexico to Jamaica with some differences according to country flair but always alot to choose from. The rooms are nice and always kept clean. Can always get what ever you need, xtra towels, blankets, pillows. Can get boxes of tomato, orange juice, even milk from the bars to take to your room if needed. There is always a musty smell in all the Rius....(its the ocean/caribbean humidity) -not a big deal for us...let's us know where we are :) All that was great Problems: At all the other Ruis when we arrive there is a bus person that grabs our luggage, a bartender gets our drink orders and we are escorted to the front desk for a quick check in. This time when we were dropped off there was no one to meet us, doors were closed, so we grabbed our luggage and went to front desk. No busperson, no bartender, so we requested a drink and were all given a grapefruit, slightly cool drink while we got checked in...ok maybe not a big deal for some, but we expected better service with a \"Palace\"---The beaches at the other Ruis were always kept clean, there were always people walking around just to collect trash/glasses so the beach was clean...not here....always trashy....glasses, plastic, ciggs, straws...kind of ugly. Pool area very beautiful, but no tables by chairs...???? There were 2 tables per pool and when the people using one of those two tables would leave, that table would be quickly snatched up. Now...I feel if you upgrade to a Palace and you need to dress for dinner there should be adequate tables at the pool to put your drinks/books/food ect on....You should not have to put that stuff on the ground....wet/bugs/dirt....classy???!!!! The pool, I noticed, did not have steps into the water, only ladders and with the age of most of the guests i am suprised. My parents are in the upper 60's and chose not to go in the pool because the ladder was a bit hard for them to use. We had a wonderful vacation as always and will continue to go to the Rius.

We loved it because they had (and still have) a beautiful, wide beach with lots of palm trees for shade. We will not return. I still can't believe neither the hotel nor Expedia told us the BEACH WAS CLOSED when we made our last minute reservation for a long weekend (4 night) get-away. The hotel manager told us they had \"no idea the government\" had a beach construction project planned. This is VERY difficult to believe considering the size of the project. My husband is an engineer and noted that a project of that scale requires a good deal of advance planning. The beach was full of heavy equipment and hundreds of yards of 2-3 foot wide metal pipe. The beach was CLOSED to all activity - you could not even walk down to the ocean. We were told we could carry our towels, etc. and walk to a Riu property about a half a mile down the beach. The reception clerk explicitly told us to carry our own towels; we would not be allowed to use the towels at the other Riu property because \"we were NOT their guests\". We had stayed at that property before and chose the Riu Palace Mexico because of the superior beach. We asked for some compensation for our spoiled vacation and were given an apology (nothing we can do for you) and a customer service email address. We were told the beach would be closed for \"2 days\", but it really looks like a project that will be ongoing for several weeks, at least. Resigned to the bad situation, we walked to the Riu Palace Riviera Maya. Along the way, we were harassed by personnel from the Viva resorts, who did not want us crossing their property. The beach at the Riu Riviera maya was open, but the water is still full of \"sand whales\" (huge black containers of sand the size of small whales) so swimming is not very pleasant. We feel like we were DECEIVED by the Riu and their staff, along with hundreds of other disappointed guests. Repairing the beach is a great idea, but doing it at the expense of paying customers??? We will be vacationing elsewhere from now on, and will advise our family and friends to avoid the Riu hotel chain.

All are very friendly and helpful, no problems whatsoever. Due to low wages in Mexico, we tipped either in $1 bills or in pesos the wait staff and housekeeping. Buffet: The breakfast was wonderful and no one would have any reason to complain. There was lots of fruit, cheeses, cold cuts, cereals, eggs, bacon etc. Even cappuccino is available and the coffee is quite good. Lunch: Beware of the fried items if you have a sensitive stomach. They are tasty but if you are not used to what we assume is lard, you may need an antacid. We ate lunch at the Patio & La Traviata; you can go between the both of them and it is a great place to view the beach. The salad bar is fabulous. They have a soft ice cream machine which many enjoyed. The buffet at the hotel is standard. Dinner: Being non-steak eaters we focused on Miagi and Krystal. Miagi was excellent. We both ordered separate dinner choices in order to taste different items. Both the salmon and shrimp with tamarind sauce were excellent. Service at both was impeccable. Krystal (fusion) was also quite good. The only things we did not care for were the 'foam' portions which do not come with every dinner. The salmon comes with a scrumptious pineapple chutney with a hint of cinnamon. Desserts at both places were good. Rooms: the bottom floor rooms begin with 00, these can be quite loud and the patios face neighboring resorts or a path so privacy is almost nil. Originally we were place on this level; within the hour some young adults were already partying in the hall. We asked to be moved and were easily relocated to the second floor. These rooms begin with the number 10. There are 3 sections on each side of the center 'plaza' and gardens. The furthest sections are closest to the beach and the quieter ones as during the evening the entertainment can be easily heard from the sections off the plaza. We had no problems with water pressure, bedding, etc. Rooms are cleaned daily unless you choose to not have it done. Staff come around to restock water, bar drinks, and towels. Tap water is NOT COSUMMABLE. The balcony was very private which made for very nice sunbathing on a windy day. The balconies have a pull out wall rack to dry clothes. Beach: The beach was very nice but the water was murky. Jet skis are now allowed and due to their 2cycle engine have become polluters. When you head towards the beach steer south of the Scuba Caribe where they launch these or you'll end up with a good bit of exhaust fumes. There are very few hammocks but if you can get one this is the ultimate in relaxation under palm trees! The sand whales were not bothersome at all but it is obvious that hurricane damage is not the only reason beaches are eroding. Watercraft is also contributing. Having been to beaches in Portugal, CA., TX, and FL I was not overwhelmed with these. The beaches in Portugal, CA and FL had much clearer water. In general: this is a nice place to get away from it all and relax, there are many Europeans and it is fun listening to the various languages and guessing where people are from. We met families from Spain, Russia, and England (these three dominate) and of course the US. Gym/Spa: Gym was soso, bring running shoes and enjoy the area of Playacar instead of the treadmill. The elliptical was okay. Sauna and jacuzzi are nice on chilly days! Tips: Take antacid with you. There is a drug store in the shopping center just down from the hotel, pricey but good in a pinch. They carry amoxicillin and erythromiacin. You do not need beach towels, hotel provides them. The hotel shop is very expensive, go to the shopping center down the street. Also, late at night they take pesos only. Money exchange at the front desk is easy, exchange rates are posted. Drinks are weak, look at the bar menu and be specific about brands and you will get it. Wine is either Mexican or Portuguese and below average. Dinner attire: Men - they do require slacks/long pants; no t-shirts. My companion wore a non-collar shirt with sport jacket and had no problem. Other men wore collared shirts. Ladies wore nice dresses or slacks/nice tops. A few were in after 5 dresses; especially young couples on their honeymoon. Lunch: no shorts/sleeveless tanks in the buffet at the main hotel. at the Patio and LaTraviata everyone had nice swim coverups. They expect decency which is not asking too much. Evening entertainment: The Flamenco dancers were the best. The young people who perform the 'American themed shows' do work very hard and many work around the facility during the day. The Michael Jackson show was pretty good. Some of the shows were 'kitchy' and I felt that the corporation could have planned something more authentic to the Mexican culture. The plaza gazebo had excellent(!!!) local musicians and there is plenty of room to dance. These were our favorite. Drinks are also served in the plaza area. All in all it was interesting for my first trip to Mexico.

The weather was great and honestly the staff were always around in huge numbers - cleaners, waiters, managers, animation, you name it. Always saying 'Hola' and smiling. The food in the buffet was great, I always laugh when people say all inclusive is 'Samey', course its going to be if you have a bit of everything every night!! It was always plentiful, with impressive ice sculptures and fancy designs. The other bookable restaurants were excellent, although there were a few that served enormous amounts of food - like the brazilian 'La Bodega' they serve a six course of meat of skewers..... The best thing about this hotel is we can use all the others but still ours stays somewhat private as they cant come to us ( except the other Riu Palace). We loved the Riu Palace Riviera Maya, this was the exact same as ours but the more modern version. I have to say a lot more children too....!! However we adored the buzz at their pool and beach, seemed livlier, loud music. All in all this whole Playacar complex is ultra safe and really friendly to tourists which is great. On 24th Dec they celebrate their christmas and all the hotel guests get treated to a huge Gala dinner. It was amazing Santa and elves there, they even had 4 life size ice sculpted reindeers, you had to see it to believe it. The food was the best I have ever seen , they had lobster, crab, kingprawn, every kind of seafood in vast amounts.....then turkey, ham, lamb, salmon and beef it just went on and on. This place really is truly amazing, neither of us were ill which I was also worried about. Shopping and Fifth Avenue is also great to explore in Playa Carmen. We met a couple who took the 40 min ferry journey to Cozumel as well. I have to say the Spa is very good also I had a massage. So there you have it.

The room itself was well airconditioned and did not smell moldy at all. What did have a hint of mold however was the thick blanket that was in our closet which we actually needed b/c our stay there was during their coldest winter week. I imagine anyone not visiting during their winter would never need this blanket which is probably why it smells a bit musty.....B/C no one ever needs it. 2. The buffet food is very good. The food that should be cold was and the food that should be warm was. Minor complaint is that some of the food that could have been a bit hotter, but overall the food was excellent. 3. The pool was freezing every day so we never got to use it. As for all these cons you should take them in context, which is to say that our stay here was during their coldest winter week. I imagine anyone traveling here ordinarily would (1) never need the thick blanket and (2) be happy the pool was on the colder side as it would probably be refreshing from that hot sun. The Pros: Our check in was easy breezy & we received drinks from the front desk as they explained how to find our way around the hotel (btw there are 5 Riu's all next to each other which you have access to as well for EVERYTHING except that dinner must be eaten at your hotel); Even though it was their winter we had a blast on the beach, swam in the water which was super warm and inviting, had staff available to bring us drinks on the beach; We found the buffet & the restaurants more than satisfactory with an ample variety to suit anyones needs; We felt safe, well fed, and relaxed our entire stay. We highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a good bang for their buck. We are already looking forward to booking another vacation at this Resort.", "Date": "January 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aldergrove, Canada", "Title": "\u201cbest of everything\u201d", "Author": "kaugie", "ReviewID": "UR52958831", "Content": "stayed at RIU Palace Mexico for 1 week decenber 7th.everything was 1st class.i have stayed in 5 diffrent parts of mexico 9 times and nothing can come close to this.the 1 review who said that the rooms were mouldy so they switched to RIU Santa Fe?? there is no such hotel in this part of mexico.it is in Cabo San Lucas.no mould in our room.housekeeping was great(maybe tip once in a while) ate at a couple ala cartes,which were good,but preferred the buffet,it changed its theme every day and the variety was unbelievable(including lobster tails) grounds were immaculate.staff were friendly.people who say that the drinks are watered down do not know what they are talking about,why would they water down the drinks,i had several shots of don julio (premium tequila) during my stay and believe me they were not watered down,besides there is a bar in your room.those bottles are full.lobby was very fancy and all staff was great.pool temp was perfect. after being in the hot sun ,you want to be refreshed,not dive into a hot tub.only draw back(if you could call it one) the hotel gets very quiet very early,so if you want to party,go to the RIU Tequila across the street,the guests at our hotel were allowed in the other 5 RIU 's in the area but only 1 other RIU was allowed in our hotel..would definitely go back again ,but doubt if i could get that good of a deal again.-Kevin ,vancouver", "Date": "January 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cPleasantly pleased\u201d", "Author": "sha58", "ReviewID": "UR52692072", "Content": "I travelled alone with my 3 older children and we had a great time.

Overall Value = A First class flight and traveled during the busy week between Christmas and New Years I think the value was good. Room = B The room was large enough and had conveniences of stocked mini-bar, LCD tv, bidet toilet, and private balcony. Only problem was the bed was 2 separate twins next to each other (not very conducive for snuggling :) Location = B+ It took us 55 min to and from the airport. It's located in Playacar which is a secure gated community within Playa del Carmen. The hotel is adjacent to a small shopping plaza with a starbucks and a Santander bank that will convert dollars and an ATM for cash withdrawal (trans fee is 7.5 pesos and my US bank (TD) did not charge me a fee). The shopping plaza is the pickup stop for many offsite excursions. Riu Palace Mexico is also surrounded by 4 additional Riu hotels that have all-inclusive reciprocity with the palace (except for dinner meals). Cleanliness = B+ The rooms, lobby, restaurants and bathrooms were all very clean. As referenced by some other reviewers there is a faint musty smell throughout. This is due to the proximity to the ocean and the age of the hotel (something that would be hard pressed to avoid for an older charming hotel on the water). Service = A+ The service makes the hotel. The staff are very friendly, hard working and do not miss a beat. You will be brought drinks as you lay in the hammock on the beach\u2026. Entertainment = B+ You will be surprised at how well they coordinate the entertainment. They have bands on the beach during the day and nightly shows and music in the theatre or in the courtyard. The grounds are gorgeous and make for a relaxing enjoyable evening. However, if you are looking to party like a rock star you may want to consider Cancun, no yelling, screaming and vomiting at the Riu Palace. The hotel truly caters to every age group. If you do crave a nightclub the Riu across the street has a disco. Food = B Let's not confuse service with food. The service is excellent but the food is adequate and there are many cases where the food really exceeds expectations. The buffet has a strong selection and there are variations every evening. The house wine is a choice between a decent Mexican or Portuguese red or white and your glass will never be empty. If you are looking to enhance your zagat-like diary you may want to avoid all-inclusive all together. The worst thing about the hotel is the need to arrange for the restaurants reservations. It will remind you of standing out in line for tix for your favorite rock star. Folks will bolt in like cockroaches at 8AM sharp for a number in line for reservations. Beach = A+ The beach is wonderful. The beach is structured in two tiers: first tier follows the pool and has much shade under the palm trees, hammocks and volleyball. The next tier is in the hot sun in front of the ocean. We didn't have much trouble finding chairs during the busy holiday week. You can do everything or nothing. Gym = C- The gym is not so good. The machines were old, there was one pitcher of water available and it was hot in the work-out room. If you train religiously you may want to check-out one of the other Riu gyms in the area. Spa = B + Spa massages and hair treatments are available but for an extra fee. There is an option to get a message on the beach (many folks took advantage of this). Also, the rear of the spa outside has a heated Jacuzzi. Some of the previous reviewers were not bright enough to figure this out. Activities = A+ Daily activities from rifle shooting, volleyball, dancing lessons and horseshoes and non-motor ocean water sport items are available for fun in the ocean. Other fee activities like scuba trips, Jet Ski, and parasailing are conveniently arranged on the beach. Cancun Airport = D Obviously not a fault of the hotel but worth mentioning in this review. Prepare for chaos at (CUN) airport. There is little information or notification of what is going on. There are also droves of people looking to solicit you to drive to your hotel, sell you a trip or whatever else. Arrange for transportation in advance and get a private ride. You will already be tired from a long flight and an impending 55 minute drive.", "Date": "January 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cA great all-inclusive getaway\u201d", "Author": "Sh5fam", "ReviewID": "UR52198149", "Content": "Our family of 5 (mom, dad, a 15 year-old and 11 year-old twins) stayed at the Riu Palace Mexico from Dec 19th to Dec. 25th. We were looking for a week of fun and sun at an all-inclusive resort and this is exactly what we got. We found the hotel beautiful, the staff extremely professional, friendly and helpful and the Playacar beach area lovely. Here are a few of our observations/recommendations.... * The hotel is approximately 50 mins. (with no traffic) from the Cancun airport. Arrange for transportation to pick you up from the airport and make sure that the representative who approaches you is from the specific service you hired. It is very important that they show you your name on their manifold. Be aware, there are literally hundreds on solicitors outside the arrival gate just waiting to give you a ride while they attempt to sell you timeshares, hotel alternatives, excursions, etc. * The check-in at the hotel was quick and painless. The front desk staff is extremely well trained. * The rooms are very nice and spacious, but don't expect serious luxury. They were more than adequate for a beach vacation. * The hotel grounds are immaculate and beautifully landscaped. The pool is nice....it is actually 2 separate pools, each in a semi-circular design. We generally found the water a bit cold and like most guests, actually preferred to swim in the warmer ocean. Management should consider heaters. The jacuzzi was simply a smaller pool with water jets, but not heated...we were a bit surprised by this. Get to the pool early each day or lounge chairs won\u2019t be available. * The beach is beautiful, but be prepared for the man-made erosion barriers that all the hotels beaches have in front of them. One could argue that they take away from the aesthetics, but many beach-goers (including us) found that they were fun to climb on. Water sports are available for an additional fee. * The gym and spa were well appointed. There were plenty of aerobic and weight equipment (part of the all-inclusive package)...spa services were extra. * Riu has many hotels in the area. The Palace hotels (Mexico and Riviera Maya) are the two \"high-end\" resorts and guests of either can use the amenities at all the Riu hotels in the area. All guests must eat dinner at their respective hotels. * The food is pretty much what you would expect from an all-inclusive resort....plenty of it, but not particularly noteworthy. However, it was always fresh and there was quite a variety. As for the water, we typically drank bottled, but we also had water served from a pitcher several times and no one in our family had any stomach ailments. The waiters and waitresses were excellent and always helpful and friendly. We often left a gratuity at the table. * The entertainment at night is amateurish, but still fun to watch. The one main complaint we had was the lack of activity after dinner. However, Playa Del Carmen is only a 5 minute taxi ride and is a fun way to spend the evening. In addition, we enjoyed visiting the other hotels that were in close proximity. * The one regret we had was not visiting Cozumel (approx 45 min. ferry ride). We were told it has beautiful beaches and good snorkeling. * There are a few adventure parks within a half hour taxi ride from the resort that looked like fun, although if you only have a week in Mexico it may be difficult to find the time to go. * We took a taxi to Tulum (approx one hour). There are beautiful Mayan ruins on the shore. They were truly spectacular. You can see everything you want in about one hour. * On our departure date, we were picked up from the hotel at 3:30pm for our 7:00pm flight home. The hotel gave us a one-hour extension for check-out and allowed us to store our bags with the bellhop so that we could continue to use of the resort until our departure. Overall, our family considers our recent visit to Riu Palace Mexico as one of our better trips. The area is beautiful, the hotel is lovely and the staff is extremely well trained and genuinely very friendly.

It was difficult to get reservations at the a la carte restaurants. Dinner does not start until 6:30 which is too late if you have young children.

We stayed the week of Dec. 14th - 21st. We have stayed in all of the major resort locations in Mexico but this was our first time to the Mayan Riviera. I will tell you now that if you are looking for an honest review by a person that understand what all inclusives are about than this is the review for you. For example, a mosquito bite can't ruin my trip and I understand that the hotels don't control the weather. I go away to have a great time and enjoy myself and the Riu More than held up their end of the deal this year. I will break my review into sections for those of you who are looking for specific information. The bus ride from the airport: This is very painless and is no reason not to go to Playa The Location: This hotel was the first hotel that we have stayed at that was located in a subdivision. Outside the hotel there are lots of houses (vacation homes I assume as there is lots of golf nearby) there is a street with sidewalks that takes you in to Playa Del Carmen (5th Ave. is the place to go, $5 cab from the resort). There is also a smaller market with the usual Mexican shopping and a Starbucks if you are craving one. If you are looking for deals this is not the place to go. There are also some smaller ruins about 10 min from the resort if you walk to the right out of the entrance of the resort. This is great for people who want to see ruins while they are there but aren't willing to give up a day on the beach to see the larger ruins. The Hotel: The hotel was very clean. If you have ever been to a Riu before than you know they keep everything looking spotless at all times. The front desk staff are usually helpful and there is almost always one front desk member who speaks English very well. Our check in was fast. They brought us all a drink to have during check in as they always have done at the Riu's we have visited before. Our luggage was taken to our rooms by the staff and we were down on the beach by 2pm to enjoy the rest of the day. The Beach: The beach is great. There are large sandbags out front of most of the resorts that are there to help rebuild the beach after it was destroyed by the hurricanes. So far it is working very well and the beach is getting bigger every year. While some people claim that the sandbags are somewhat of an eye sore I will disagree strongly. Not only are they there for a purpose but they have also attracted a small amount of sea life which makes snorkeling out front of the resort much more enjoyable. If you are looking for more of a snorkeling adventure there is a boat that goes out to the reef every day for an hour tour for $29. I didn't get a chance to do it but I spoke with some people who did and they said it was well worth it. They saw lots of fish and sea turtles etc. The Pool: This is the only area that I have some criticism of the resort. The pool is not anything special. if you don't care about the pool then read on but as a pool lover I was somewhat disappointed. That being said, since you are staying at the Riu Palace you have access to all of the other surrounding Riu's and they all have very nice pools (especially the other Riu Palace just down the beach to the left). We actually spent a day at the other Palace sitting by their pool. It is the best of all. The Rooms: They are all junior suites which means there is a sunken living area with a couch (hide-a-bed) and small plasma screens (probably 24 inches or so). But then again if you going away to watch TV save yourself the money and stay home. The bathroom was spotless and the shower head was one of the best I have seen in a hotel/resort. The housekeepers always leave a new towel animal every day and remember to tip these people as they work very hard and make very little (a couple $ a day). We left our housekeeper a $20 tip at the end of the week. A big tip can really go a long way with the staff at the resort. Each room also has a minibar and in room liquor dispensers that are filled every other day but if you run out you can always call the front desk and they will bring you whatever you need. Since it is a Palace there is also 24hr room service. The Food: The food was possibly the best we had ever had. All inclusive food is just that. Don't go in expecting to eat 5 star restaurant food that would cost around $50 a plate at home because you will be terribly disappointed. The buffets are much like they would be in Canada/US. I will say that the Piazza at this resort was outstanding if you like pizza. The a la carte restaurants are a different story. We ate at all of them but the Steakhouse. The Asian restaurant was great. Don't be scared to order the beef, it is actually quite good, not your typical Mexican steak. I had the salmon which was also good. The fine dining restaurant called Fusion was our best meal of the week. Take my advice and have the ravioli, the steak and whatever desert you like. I would have been happy to pay $30 -$40 for that meal at home. However, keep in mind that all inclusive resorts are sometimes inconsistent so don't hold me to my word. La Bodega which is a Brazillian Rodizio style restaurant was also good, but if you are not a meat eater than don't bother going there. Nightlife: The nightlife at the Palace is pretty weak. All is quite by around 1130 pm but if you want to party late into the night just walk across the street to the Riu Tequila and go to the Disco. Or if you are looking for something more go Into town. We went to Coco Bongo one night ($50 all inclusive, talk to the entertainment team about tickets). It was amazing, If you have been to coco bongo or any other Cancun bar then you know what I'm talking about. If you are looking to party then this is the place to go. Again it is a $5 cab ride there and back. Summary: Our trip to the Riu Place was great, even thought the weather was the worst we had ever seen in all our trips to mexico we all had a great time and would be happy to go back.

Upon arrival at the hotel, they greeted us with a glass of punch and the check went smoothly and fast as we were only 4 checking in ... There are 434 rooms in the complex .

The crowd at this RIU is firmly over forty and the majority from Europe. There were kids at this resort. The more I travel the pickier I get - so I may be beginning to turn into \"one of those fussy\" people! You've been advised. Manuel greeted us (and everyone) with a same warm welcome - every time we ran into him. What an asset to the hotel. Our room was on the third level - one elevator in each wing of the hotel building, no problem for us, we are mobile and were grazing every few hours so needed the stairs to work some of it off. If you have mobility issues - this place may not be a good fit. The room itself was just ok - we didn't pay for or get much of a view. The balcony had a full cement railing/wall - and the space very small. If you sat in the chair you stared at cement - that's it. On one side of the hall rooms had a courtyard view and a few were facing the ocean. RIU needs new linens - towels and sheets clean but a little tattered. Lighting throughout the space was an issue. Tub area was basically dark. Good water pressure and modern appliances. Air conditioning was LAME - hard to sleep. There is also a weird matress pad that had a \"moisture\" (?) barrier that made it even hotter. Pillows were very firm. The two double beds put together was odd - but I knew about that from reading other reviews. There were a lot of housekeepers and our room was made up quickly each day. We didn't order room service. When we arrived around 3 pm - we were hungry and tried the outdoor buffet by the pool/beach - my first impression was really bad - it did improve with future experiences but just slightly. Messy counters, overheated food, not a lot of choice, dried-out desserts. The indoor Don Julian Buffett was very good, lots of choices and food was freshly prepared. Very good Mexican choices everywhere. And fake \"nacho\" cheese for us Yankees :-) I wasn't too impressed with any of the reservation-only restaurants - they were good, not great. One notable experience; a great Filet Mignon at the reservation restaurant El Patio. Don't know why everyone thinks Krystal is so great. (What is that Avocado Foam anyway?) I didn't find any Mayan coffee being prepared at any restaurant - that's one treat I look forward to when visiting Mexico. The regular coffee was strong - not in a good way. We like to drink Iced Tea and it wasn't offered. Soda pop offering; Pepsi products. The liquor selection was ok. No Grand Marnier, or 43 for apres dinner. Great beach. Lots of chaise lounge chairs at the beach and plenty of palm tree shade - no palapas (none needed). Ok bar service at the beach - mostly a tray with a few selections to choose from. Just FYI a lot of small bathing suits and lots of skin showing. One nudie hooter mama was standing closeby watching an afternoon beach wedding and managed to get noticed enough to get herself in a pic with the groom and best man - nice memory for the bride, eh?! Just my little editorial - I guess if you get married on the busy beach - that might happen! Pool area nice, a little older, offered a lot of padded loungers with umbrellas - I liked that - but spent most of my sun time at the beach. The theatre was very small compared to others - the \"shows\" were ok. Not a lot of nightlife at this RIU. Nice live music in the plaza courtyard each evening. Only one little convenience store on site - but you are a short walk to the little outdoor mall in this Playacar gated community. Many evening walkers and full or part time residents out in this community. A relaxing time, probably will try another hotel in the same area at some future time.

Ruined my wedding day.\u201d", "Author": "rieb16", "ReviewID": "UR50839572", "Content": "I recently got married at the Riu Palace Mexico. During my stay there my group and I were treated very poorly and unfairly and my wedding day was basically ruined. Our wedding coordinator at the resort was very reluctant to work with me on anything from the beginning. I had trouble dealing with her even before we got to Mexico. The resort as a whole was simply unable to cater to our large group of 59 people. We were told only a few weeks before the wedding that groups of 27 or more people would have to eat dinner at the late seating which was at 8:45pm. This wouldn't have been a problem except for the fact that we were going to spend $1300 extra dollars to rent out the disco for a reception. They also told us we could spend $700 more dollars to rent out one of the restaurants, but that all 59 people in our party would have to eat the same one dish that we chose for them. In a group of 60, its just about impossible to assume everyone will be able to eat either beef, chicken or fish. We were also told that if we wanted cocktails at the reception, it would cost an extra $9 per person (even though everyone had already paid for alcohol in their all-inclusive resort package). Between all the money we were spending on the Caprice package (the most expensive wedding package), the fact that we were bringing 60 people to their resort during an off season, and knowing that it was an all-inclusive resort, we really felt like they should have been able to work with us on some of these costs. Of course, tropical storm Ida decided she wanted to join us they day of the wedding, so it needed to be moved inside. Understanding that this was in no way the resort's fault, we just tried to stay positive when we were told the ceremony would need to be held in the resort's theater. Prior to this, several people in our group had actually witnessed a wedding in the resort's lobby the day before and said it was very nice, so we were optimistic. When I asked if we could have our ceremony in the lobby instead like the other couple, we were told \"Oh, those people paid a lot of extra money to have their ceremony in the lobby.\" REALLY? They paid more to have it in the LOBBY??? How come I didn't see that in the list of add-ons? How come that option was never even mentioned to me, I had to bring it up? And then when I did, suddenly there would be another expense? Why would it possibly cost more to have the service in the lobby versus the theater? It wasn't going to cost the resort any more. But honestly, I was just too exhausted to fight with her anymore at that point, so I just gave in, thinking the theater might be better than I was imagining. But no, the theater was atrocious. All they did was add an arch and, other than that, it was just the theater. I walked down an aisle formed out of pink velvet theater chairs!!! An aisle so thin that my father and I could barely fit down it. My dress kept hitting those horrible velvet chairs to the point where we almost fell over. My photos are hideous because I was surrounded by a sea of pink velvet chairs, lace curtains, horrible pink patterned carpet and ceiling fans!! We actually downgraded our photo package after-the-fact because there were only a handful that were actually any good. Not to mention we didn't hear a word from our coordinator or anyone else on the wedding staff the second after the ceremony started. No one checked in to see if everything went ok. No one tried to contact us to follow up and see if we were happy with the ceremony or if there was anything else they could do to help. I was simply appalled at the lack of customer service we received the entire time we were dealing with the resort. Oh, but we're not done. Outside of just the wedding issues we had, we were also unable to make reservations at any of the specialty restaurants, except for the Brazilian steakhouse. For as large as the resort is, only 2 of the 4 specialty restaurants are open every night (again, showing they are unable, or just unwilling, to cater to the large amount of people who were staying there, even in an off month). And I'd be surprised if each restaurant had more than 50 seats. And in order to try and secure one of these precious seats, you had to get up at 7am to make sure you were one of the first 50 people in line at 8am when the reservations table opened up, in hopes you could get in. Oh, and if it was any time after 10:30am, the reservations table was closed and there was no way to make a reservation anywhere, even at the Brazilian restaurant. Maybe this is the way all of the resorts in Playa del Carmen do things, but I've been to very nice resorts in both Cancun and Puerta Vallarta and NEVER had to deal with so many rules and limitations. And to top it all off, at least half of my guests, including myself, went home with bronchitis and sinus infections - almost positively due to the poor ventilation systems in the rooms. Several of my guests actually asked to have their rooms switched the first day they arrived because of leaks in the roofs and musty odors. For a resort that claims to be five star, you certainly could have fooled us. And, some of our guests/groomsmen also almost slipped and fell while walking down the aisle and when members of the wedding party informed the coordinator that the floor was slippery and wet she simply wiped it up with a piece of paper and proceeded to toss that trash onto a nearby table in what was supposed to be my beautiful wedding room. Appalled by this, one of the groomsmen actually had to throw the paper away or she would of just left it there. Also, while myself and my bridesmaids were getting ready for the wedding in one of our rooms, we requested a bottle of champagne that we never received and had to trudge down to the lobby bar to get drinks for all 5 girls in the wedding party plus my mother and grandmother, and when we requested help back to the room with them, so not to spill them, we were rudely told no by the wait staff so I had to get my cousin to come help us. The worst part is, I only get to have a wedding once... and my day was ruined. I just really expected the resort to take more care with such a special day. So now, I just want to make sure no other bride as to go through what I did. The Riu is NOT the place to stay in Mexico, no matter the reason you are visiting.

We have only been to Playa Del Carmen once over 10 years ago and it has changed tremendously. Lobby/Check-in: Very nice, large lobby area and they greet you quickly when you arrive. Front desk was very helpful for all our needs. You can cash traveller's checks for pesos. They can arrange travel to the airport (see note below). They can also tell you who to talk to if you want to leave the resort for an excursion one day. Grounds: Extravagant fountains in the center of the resort as seen in the pictures. The grounds were kept up nicely. Rooms: We had a standard room facing out to a garden area and the room was great. It was large with a nice flat screen TV with quite a few channels. There was a fully stocked bar and mini-fridge with water, sodas & beer. Bathroom was fine and the water pressure was good. A/C worked very well. There was a small balcony with seating. The beds were two full-size beds pushed together which was odd. They were pretty hard, but we slept on them just fine. I was more worried from other reviews. Pool: Nice pool(s) surrounding a bar (walk-up and swim-up). There was usually plenty of loungers for the pool. One side was quieter than the other, so you have a choice on preference. Overall, there were very few children at the resort. Beach: The beach was large with plenty of loungers. There were always plenty in the shade, but usually a few free in the sun as well. Water was clear and they had those sand whales, but that didn't bother us. There is no beach drink service, though they sometimes have staff bring down some random drinks to pass around. Restaurants: There is a main buffet restaurant with indoor and patio seating. It is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. You have to wear a shirt for breakfast & lunch. Men have to wear long pants for dinner. It's got quite a variety of food and we felt it was very good given our expectations. It's not gourmet by any means. There are two restaurants between the pool & beach that are open for lunch mainly. They too had decent food you would expect for that type of setting. Service was good in these restaurants and you could get any drink you wanted with any meal (even Mimosas at breakfast). Specialty Restaurants: There are four specialty restaurants and we went to three of them (Fusion, Japanese, Steakhouse, missed Brazilian). We liked all the specialty restaurants and the service at them. Men must wear pants and short/long sleeve dress shirts (pants rule is strict, you might be able to get away with anything that isn't a t-shirt). We liked the Fusion restaurant the best. All the food was quite good. It was better than the general restaurants, so we recommend them. See tips below for booking tips. Bars: There are about five or so bars and they are all open at various times. The piano bar off the lobby is nice before dinner and they probably serve the best drinks. Mixed drinks did seem watered down a bit, but you could get stronger ones by getting to know the staff and doing some tipping. Other Riu resorts: We didn't visit the other resorts even though it was allowed. We didn't see a point since you could only eat lunch there and that was probably similar to our resort's. I think there might be a dance club at one of the resorts. Spa/Gym/Tennis: We didn't use any of these, but they were available. We did play sand volleyball and pool volleyball a couple of times. They had other activities as well throughout the day. Shopping: You can walk directly across the street for a small shopping center with a Starbucks. However, I highly recommend walking (20+ mins) or taking a $5 cab ride to Playa del Carmen for at least one lunch and one dinner. We did and 5th avenue is great for shopping and eating. We ate at Carboncitas for dinner and 100% Natura for lunch. Both of those were excellent Mexican places since the resort didn't have too much Mexican (which was surprising). In Playa Del Carmen, you can always try to negotiate on price. Service: This was somewhat of a negative at first. It felt like the friendliest staff were only the ones trying to sell/upsell you something (like Scuba Caribe). After we did some tipping and got to know some of the staff, they were much friendlier. You should go out of your way to be nice and they'll warm up to you quicker. Helpful Hints: Travel from the Airport: If you don't have transporation arranged ahead of time, be careful. Someone will probably try to help you even though they are trying to sell you something (like excursions). We ended up taking a grey-line shuttle for $30 per person and it was fine. Taxi fares were quoted at $90 which seemed really high. Supposedly, there was an ADO bus that would take you directly to Playa Del Carmen, but we didn't see any signs of it. Tipping: It is not required, but we felt tips in either pesos or US dollars were greatly appreciated. The attention we recieved was higher by tipping just minimally. Money: I'd advise getting some local money (pesos) when you are there. It's absolutely not required since everyone takes US dollars or Euros even in Playa Del Carmen. However, many things are priced so you ge a better deal in pesos rather than dollars/euros. Also, when tipping it may be better to tip in pesos depeding on how much you want to tip (ie. 20 pesos instead of 2 dollars). Travel back to Airport: We booked a taxi back to the airport a couple of days ahead at the front desk for $65 which is actually a good rate. However, the desk associate set it for 2 hours before our flight. When we showed up that morning, they said we really needed to get to the airport 3-4 hours before the flight. This was quite stressful to say the least. As it turns out, it takes about an hour to travel to Cancun and the airport wasn't terribly crowded, so we didn't have any troubles at all. I'd recommend giving yourself more time than we did because I think we were very lucky. The outbound terminal from Cancun to US was very nice (Duty free, restaurants, etc...) Other Riu Resorts: Do not confuse this resort (Riu Palace Mexico) with a very similar resort (Riu Palace Riviera Maya). We did and we ended up going to the wrong one at first. So, it was a $5 taxi ride to the other one which was 10 minutes away (we would have walked, but we had our luggage). Beach: There is no beach drink service, so you might want to pack some larger drink tumblers to fill up on way to beach. It's a short walk back to the beach bar, but the cups they give are terribly small (8 oz maybe). Specialty restaurants: Booking must be done from 8:30-10:30am in the Salon bar in front of these restaurants. They hand out numbers around 8am and they call numbers at 8:30. If you want a 6:30 seating, you probably need to get there around 8am. If you are ok with an 8:45 seating, then you can be later. We at at 8:45 each night and didn't have a problem. We got our number at just before 8:30am and were done in 15-20 mins. Also, some restaurants are closed on some nights, so check the whole week ahead or you might miss one you want to try. Internet: Bring your laptop/netbook for free WIFI in lobby/bar. Otherwise, you have to play to use resort supplied laptop time. No access in rooms. Security: If you leave the resort, you should feel very safe. The resorts are in a gated community with high end housing all the way to Playa del carman. Playa del Carmen has police roaming the town, so it's very safe. The retailers will call out to you to visit thier store constantly. Most of them don't really expect you to do so. You should just be polite, smile and say no thank you if you are not interested.", "Date": "November 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Roseville, Ca", "Title": "\u201cOnce again....a wonderful time at the Palace.\u201d", "Author": "MicleleL", "ReviewID": "UR50074090", "Content": "Just returned from 10 nights at the Palace Mexico.

And I must agree with other reviews that the RPM is in need of a facelift, but I would definitely go back to this resort again and would extend our time to one week at least. The beach at the RPM was one of the best in all our travels. There were plenty of chairs to choose from in either the sun or shade both at the beach and around the pools. No need to hurry in the morning to try to get a chair. They were available anytime. Staff at the front desk was extremely courteous and helpful when called upon to assist as were those working in the dining areas. Almost everyone we saw greeted us with a smile and \u201cHola.\u201d If there was a downside to the dining establishments we ate at, I would have to say service and quality of food suffered in the La Bodega Restaurant, one of the speciality restaurants.

I would advise getting there at least by 8:30 in order to get your choice of restaurants. There were two seatings at these restaurants, either 18:30 or 20.45. We were always satisfied with the Don Julian restaurant whose buffet menu changed nightly. There was roast pig, roast turkey, and a myriad of different entrees to chose from.

I did not care for the process of reserving a table in the \"specialty restaurants\". Waiting in line at 8:30am, no guarantee). The Japanese restaurant was average. The pool area appeared very old and dated compared to the how gorgeous the hotel is but guests are able to use other riu's so this was not a problem. Drinks were small plastic juice glasses. Most of the staff was very nice. All in all, nice place - just a tad over-rated.", "Date": "October 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colorado Springs", "Title": "\u201cFantastic\u201d", "Author": "Caneps", "ReviewID": "UR47666926", "Content": "This was wonderful and the staff was great.

I love this hotel. I travelled with my mum to mexico for 2 weeks. The weather was fantastic, the hotel was fantastic and everything about it is fantastic. The reception staff greet you with a drink, and talk you through details of restuarants bars etc while the bellboy takes your bags to your room. During our stay we received calls from reception, checking that we had everything we needed, they sent gifts to our rooms (fruit platters, local orniments etc) and could not do enough for you. The rooms themselves are exceptionally clean, spacious and comfortable, the maids cleaned daily, and the mini bar was restocked with international brands daily also. We had various towel animals left for us during our stay, which was a very nice touch. in addition to this, we had a turn-down service every evening, and also fresh towels every day. The restuarants are brilliant. The waiting staff are extremely friendly, they remember your names, and even what drinks you like with your meals. The buffets are always being refilled with fresh food (which is not below standard by any shot) there are chefs at stations cooking fresh foods to order and always plenty of options to chose from. the speciality restuarants are harder to get in to but with it. you need to book these in the mornings, but they do go very quickly, but persevere :) The pool area is very relaxing with ample loungers, I dont think we ever needed to hunt some down as there were loads free. plenty of shade for the hotter hours of the day too. Two pools, one quieter pool area, and the other has the activities and the pool bar, which is lovely. they are spotlessly clean too. the waiting staff are constantly checking that you have all the drinks you need, and fresh fruit on some days too, which is great! the entertainment round the pool is the usual kind, volleyball, beach volley ball, ping-pong, rifle shhoting etc always in the afternoons. they also did spanish lessons and dance lessons on the beach too. a very full daily activity list if you wanted to take part. The beach is very well maintained. it is raked every night and cleaned of sea weed often (they bury it so its out of sight) they also have a bar service there too, with waiters coming round and they had a band on the beach a couple of times. They have built the beach back up, after a bad hurricaine a few years back. they have the sand \"whales\" to break the tide, they dont spoil your enjoyment of th beach or sea at all. lots of water sports if you want to take part. including boats, kayaks and wave riders. (some payable) In the evenings, there is usually a band playing in the plaza. very good fun as the ent.s staff have the guests dancing salsa and mumbo. the evening shows are varied, very caberet style. usually starting at 845pm. they are excellent, the entertainment staff all work so hard. (especially Mario, the cuban nutter! lol) if you want to extend your night you can go to the disco in the riu tequilla, i personally thought it was rubbish lol. the entertainment staff will take you for a night at copco bongo for $50 all in, which is open till around 6am (if youre up for it) I can not complain about this hotel, the staff, the food, or any of it. yes it is slightly dated, but i like the colonial style with the real wood and the wrought iron works. if you prefer concrete and un-interesting, then choose a different hotel.

Our 2nd trip there.\u201d", "Author": "BLHickson", "ReviewID": "UR45851544", "Content": "My new husband and I returned to RPM for our honeymoon almost 1 yr after our 1st visit. Everything was very good the first time, but our honeymoon was perfect because the staff remembered our names, gave us VIP treatment, and gave us extra special attention, from extra \"towel art\" in our upgraded room (ocean view w/ jacuzzi suite), special gifts of fruit trays, tequila and handmade art, flower petals on our dining tables (even at the buffet!), even to insisting on giving us extra entrees at the reservations-only specialty restaurants. We think the hotel is beautiful and old fashioned looking, with Spanish Colonial architecture (\"mission\" style is simpler and California-looking), lots of beautiful tile and black wrought iron, and, while this resort may be an older resort, they are fortunate to have a very expansive lovely beachfront where newer resorts do not. There is a musty smell to the hotel, probably due to its age and the heat and humidity, but also probably due the beautiful mahogany wood used throughout the facility. If it were built w/ concrete, there wouldn't be such a smell, but that's concrete and most of the newer resorts are primarily concrete (much cheaper material but also has the \"modern\" look to it). The wood adds to the beauty of the resort and the rooms. I didn't think the smell was offensive, but I've been around boats, the sea, and humid climates all my life. Even tho the resort is all-inclusive, the staff truly appreciate tips and a little goes a long way. Food on the buffet ranges from great to average depending on how long you stay, to how many guests are at the hotel, to who is working in the kitchen that day and what you choose to eat. The buffet obviously caters to European and Hispanic appetites. The guests from Belgium and Sweden we spoke to thought the buffet food was awesome. The buffet is huge and there is always something that you will like. We're American and thought the buffet was both decadent if you wanted to indulge and healthy if you did not. They always had grilled or broiled fresh grouper or snapper at lunch or dinner, which was delicious. The salad dressings left something to be desired as American tastes go, but please remember, this is Mexico, not the home of buttermilk ranch dressing. Great fresh fruit, breads, cheeses, Mexican food, plus pasta and sauces and fresh veggies and a breakfast buffet that will send you to the beach to nap until lunch time. And desserts to make you extra fat! The maitre d' hotel, Sr. Santoyo, made us feel extra special. He is one of a kind. The specialty restaurants are excellent. We tried Krystal and the steakhouse and were very pleased w/ both. We wanted to try the Japanese Fusion restaurant but it was closed the only night we could dine there. I think it may have had to do w/ the fewer number of guests than the year before. There were definately fewer guests than the same time the year before, I'm sure it's the economy. Room service for our breakfast always provided tons more food than we could eat and we hate to be wasteful. The one time we ordered room service for dinner after we'd been to Chichen Itza for the day and were dead tired (great trip tho!), it was typical foreign room service. It's not American room service and they had a hard time translating my substitutions from what's exactly on the menu. No big deal. My husband ate everything anyway! The Scuba Caribe vendor that contracts for the water sports leaves a litte to be desired, they didn't have our catamaran reservation on their list (there was only one name on the entire list), but we got one anyway and stayed out almost 2 hours without any problem. These are young guys operating this and they are obviously trying to go for the paid for scuba/snorkeling trips, but the same thing happens back home. I think sometimes tourists from very \"capitalist\" countries (like ours!) forget that not everyone has that \"hustle\" mentality. And let's face it, customer service isn't that great in America anymore either. The pool at RPM is beautiful and is cleaned every night. We think it is the best pool area at any of the Riu resorts. The drink service is great (both at poolside and on the beach or under the palm trees), swim up bar very cool and the best at any of the Riu resorts. The beach is raked every night and the chairs organized so that every inch is spotless the next morning. One afternoon we walked to the other Riu resorts to see the other pool/lobby areas and came back very happy with our choice of resorts. The Riu Palace Riviera Maya has a large pool area w/ some different features infinity pool (for the \"older folks\"), concrete loungers inside a pool area w/ \"tables\" in little alcoves to put your drinks/ashtrays on and jacuzzi alcoves, all very cool but where do all those cigarette butts go?), but it was VERY crowded and noisy w/ loud music and a crowd of twenty somethings looking for action. It just was not our cup of tea, but might have been if we were 20-something and hot for a wet meat market. The Riviera Maya has a big crowded pool area, but a VERY small beach. I should note that the bar staff were quick to notice our \"gold\" wristbands and treated us very well, as did staff at every other Riu resort we ventured. (If you stay at one of the 2 Riu Palace resorts, you get a gold band, and have access to all the other resorts' amenities, but not vice versa.) The Riu Palace Mexico resort is fabulous and we'll be going back the same time (\"shoulder season\") every year. We travel a lot, so this is a safe bet for us once a year to chill out. We like the low key (read \"no children\") ambiance. The band in the courtyard is entertaining after dinner and allows you to dance and drink and try out your salsa moves that you may have learned at the noon lesson. It's fun! Some folks may think the nighttime shows are too touristy, but hey! that's what we are, and the Mexicans are very proud to show off their culture. They should be. It's a wonderful place that is rich in history, culture, natural resources and native cuisine.", "Date": "October 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreatest vacation ever at the Riu Palace Mexico\u201d", "Author": "psnyder13", "ReviewID": "UR45792928", "Content": "My husband and I spent our 35th wedding anniversary at the Riu Palace Mexico.

We also had a look at the other RIU hotels whilst we were there and I would say it is worth paying slightly more for a five star because the service is so much better. Each evening they put on entertainment and this finished at 11pm. The Hotel was very quite after that time but you could go down town if you wanted to party some more. The Shops on Mexican Street appear to have been the best in terms of value for money.

I got married at The Riu Palace Mexico in June of 2007. We had about 80 guests come, which made this experience even better. Check-in was easy and fast. A few of us arrived about 4 days prior to the main group, and were greeted with a cocktail and a friendly smile, while given a quick rundown of where everything was located, and off we were. The wedding staff was very helpful as well. We were a bit nervous because we were told to meet the day before to go over details. From what I have seen poeple do to plan a wedding back home, it is a long stressful process. That day we sat down with the best on-site coordinator, Edith, we chose decorations, music, dinner, etc, and were done in 20 minutes!! Talk about EASY! I would highly recommend having a wedding here. We got married in the Gazebo near the hotel. Since our group was so large, we were able to reserve an entire restaurant for our reception, that was open to the beach. We all had a buffet type dinner that we got to choose, and afterwards we had a DJ for 4 hours. I spent soo much time burning cd's with songs we wanted to play, but we never even brought them out. The DJ was awesome, and had every song you could think of. He just played good songs all night, and you could request whatever you wanted as well. We requested a couple of songs for the Father-Daughter and Mother-Son dances, and we danced to those 1st. Afterwards, we danced and drank the night away. They also had bartenders staffed strictly for our reception, which was very accommodating. By far, this was probably the easiest, funnest, cheapest, and most laid back time! If you are thinking about a wedding, this is the place to tie the knot! Feel free to ask me any question! --Do not do the Riu Palace Riveria Maya, they suck! Now the hotel. The grounds were all very well maintained. There was nonstop cleaning going on all over the resort. Every evening I saw staff checking the pool chemicals and cleaning the pool. Every other day they were trimming the hedges and cutting the grass. And cleaning went on all day, every day. They work extremely hard, so be sure to tip them. One reason why I chose this resort was because of the palm trees on the beach. If you look at all of the other resorts, there are no trees. This resort had lots of shade for when you wanted to get out of the sun and relax. There are hammocks all over too. The pool was large and had a nice swim-up bar. There is a bar inside the lobby too. All the bartenders were funny and entertaining, and would pour the drinks heavily handed if requested. All over, the staff was extremely nice. Food. The food was fantastic. You have to make reservations for the restaurants (Brazilian, Steakhouse, Japanese). If you didn't, no worries because the buffet was awesome too. Trust me, I did not miss a meal. They mean it when they say \"all inclusive\". You have a bar in your room that gets restocked daily. One of my favorite, drunken, late-night munchy memories was room service. My first night there, at 2 in the morning, I made a call to room service and I must have ordered five dishes. I hung up the phone and looked at my wife with a tear in my eye, and she asked \"what?\" I replied, \"they said YES, to everything!!...everything!! That was the happiest moment of my trip. Oh yeah, right behind getting married. Like the other all inclusives around the area, thay have non-motorized watersports for the guests. You can sign up for other excursions and motor sports right on the beach, or in the hotel. Since you are staying here, you have the option to go to the other Riu resorts on the street. I think there are 3 or 4 others. You can drink at their bars and do their activities. We went right across the street to the Riu Tequila. It was a neat night atmosphere over there. They have a bar outside in the middle of the resort where everyone gathers, they have a night club, and shows as well. Riu Palace Mexico has shows and music too. Towards the weekend, the hotel has a mini-market set up right on the premises. For those who choose to leave the resort at night, you must go to 5th Ave. This is where all of the bars, restaurants, and clubs are. They have a neat open concept where lounges are open to the street. Blue Parrot is fun for drinks, fire show, and dancing on the dancefloor right on the beach. A must, if you have time. This was a family friendly resort as well. DO NOT STAY AT THE OTHER RIU PALACE. I stayed at the Riu Palace Riveria Maya last year for a wedding, and the service was horrible. The staff was rude and I had money stolen from my supposedly secure locker at their spa. I reported the incident to the management, and to this day have not been followed up with. The Bride's room didn't have a functioning a/c for days. Nothing was done to fix the issue. None of the fountains were ever on, and all looked algea infested.

Truly!\u201d", "Author": "ChrissieLinnit", "ReviewID": "UR44970469", "Content": "I'm not sure what the 'official' rating of this hotel is... indeed, I'm so confused by all the different organisations: Travel Companies; Tourist sites; Hotel bodies and Hotel owners themselves who all rate hotels using different criteria, that I tend to ignore anything that says it's the 'official' rating and just choose my holiday based on reviews I get of a short-list of options that are generally rated 4 or 5 star. The Riu Palace Mexico was one of five hotels I'd shortlisted on the Yucatan Peninsula for our September 2009 vacation. I booked it after reading scores and scores of reviews of all of the hotels on this site and on the Virtual Traveller site. No hotel ever gets a 100% rating of 5* unless it has only a very few reviews. Once a hotel gets over (approx) 20 reviews there will naturally be a smattering of lower ratings on one or another criteria, but overall, the Riu Palace Mexico seemed to hit the right spots for us as a family. Consistently good ratings and, as a Brit, I was especially interested in Brit reviews because culturally those reviews were probably going to be closer to my own expectations and needs. But, the international reviews from American and Canadian reviewers also formed a big part of my decision making. The hotel, staff, accommodation, location, all inclusive facilities and value for money all met and in some instances exceeded our expectations. HOTEL Yes, it is one of the older hotels in the region - a little over 10 years old, I think. But it is grand visually and has an air of quality about it that makes it very attractive to adults looking for something a little special. The lobby entrance is lovely with a central chandelier that was so reminiscent of an episode of Only Fools and Horses that I got hubby, son and grandson to reenact the scene for my camera! There's a piano bar there that lends an air of relaxation and grown upness (that's not a proper word, I know, but it fits!). The rooms we had were especially good, and had been recommended by another reviewer of this hotel - on this site! - I eMailed the hotel to ask if we could have the rooms and they were able to accommodate us. we had two junior suites, sea facing, on the second floor... which was good because the palm trees have grown over the years and to get the best sea view yo do need to be on the second floor. However, I will say that it wouldn't really matter which way your room faces because the views are beautiful even facing the really well maintained gardens and pools! We tipped our maids and waiters daily (roughly the peso equivalent of \u00a31 each day for the maid each morning and waiters at mealtimes, meaning we spent around \u00a375 in tips in two weeks). The average non-skilled wage here is US$7.00 a day, so these people do rely on tips. The rooms are kept spotlessly clean. When we did get ants, or we couldn't work out how to work the TV, the hotel responded immediately and even made follow up calls to ensure things had been resoled to our satisfaction. The towel art was fun and we had a room war going on to see which room got best towel art over the two weeks - mine & hubby's room won! During our stay the hotel left us a small ceramic gift and some postcards are gifts... and they remembered our names even though I kept forgetting theirs! The one very small observation I will agree on with negative reviewers here is that there is a musty smell... however, after a few days you don't notice it. And, I do think it's generic to the area, being to humid and hot - not just this hotel. It only became noticeable again when we got home and I had to wash everything, even unworn clothing, to get rid of the musty odour... but it in no way detracted from our enjoyment. SERVICE All of the staff, from management to front office to waiters, maids, pool staff and gardeners were friendly and helpful. Most of the non-skilled and casual staff are Mayan descent and many still speak the Mayan language. All of them, without exception, were welcoming and clearly content. The dining areas were a treat, with food prepared and artfully displayed. Waiters and waitresses are very attentive and you never have to waive to get attention. Drinks were abundant and replenished as soon as your glass emptied. This sort of attention was evident not only inside the hotel areas but at poolside and in the palmtree hammock areas too. The all inclusive dining includes the a la carte restaurants which are all nouvelle/haute cuisine, so less is more, if you know what I mean. We only used the Krystal and Steakhouse. both were great. The buffet was large and varied enough to meet our every need at breakfast, lunch and dinner. In fact, we've all agreed that we need to lose a few pounds and get back to exercising soon! LOCATION The hotel has it's own private beach and is adjacent to several other Riu hotels, all of whose services guests of this hotel can use... the beach does have beach whales on it (large semi-submersed banks that protect the beaches from erosion) but they in no way detract from the beauty of the beach, sea or vista generally. The sea is clean and there are too many free and chageable (motorised) sea sport activities right there. The hotel is situated on a private estate called Playacar which abuts Playa del Carmen to the south. It's a good walk into Playa del Carmen and if you can handle the heat and humidity would take you around 45 minutes. However, I'm not good in heat and so we used the local taxi which cost US$5.00 plus tip. Taxi's all have fixed charging rates (check out the local website for Playa del Carmen) Playa del Carmen has a ferry that will take you to Cozumel if you want to do some serious snorkeling, but for US$28.00 you can get a taxi to Akumal beach and spend the day snorkeling for free there. It's a gloriously picturesque beach with coral, fishes galore and turtles that swim right up to you. No shade though, so take a parasol and whack on tons of sun screen! We booked two trips with YucaTreks, again as a result of reseaching trips and trip organisers on this and other sites. YukaTreks take small groups (from 4 up to 13), they are English speaking and their prices are very competitive. Also, because they aren't big coaches they get to sites quicker, before big tours get there, so you spend longer a the location and it's less crowded. We did Sea to Cenote with them - it's really Cenote to sea, but mitch, our guide explained that Sea to Cenote just sounds better (???). A cenote is an underground river/river bed/pool and snorkeling in one is an awesome experience. You also get a small jungle trek in there, learn something of the Yucatan history and wildlife, eat local food and if your lucky, as we were, meet a couple of European cave explorers who live there!! Mitch, of YukaTreks also escorted us on our visit to Chechin Itza and Valadollid. We got there before all of th coaches and had a guided tour with Jose. You MUST get a guide like him. His knowledge of Mayan and Toltec cultures and history brought the whole place to life. The site is over 30 sq km and there's no shade. Again, take parasols, hats and sunscreen. On a sunscreen note. All tours and many eco-sites will ban non-biodegradable sunscreens. I knew that and spent time searching for organic sunscreens before we went. If you're going to the Yucatan, remember that the whole region is an ecological area. Invest in good, environmentally friendly sunscreens, please! Our third and final trip, which I booked direct, was to Xel-Ha. A vast natural fresh and saltwater lagoon that's been turned into an eco water-park. We bought all inclusive tickets. You get all the food & drinks you want; free snorkeling equipment, towels and access to all areas. You pay extra for underwater sub helmet walking, dolphin swimming etc. Despite my aversion to dolphins in captivity, we did pay for our boys to swim with them. The trainers clearly have bonded with the dolphins and the dolphins all appeared very healthy and responsive. The boys loved the experience and the interactions ae very respectful of the animals. Overall the Xel-Ha experience is breathtaking. We did get bitten massively by mossies, despite all of us wearing organic mossie bands and sprays. A lot of that was to do with a big burst of rain, that I'm told brigs the blighters out BIG time. It left us itchy and sore for a few days but none o us would balk at the chance to go again. VALUE We paid 5* price for what I consider to be a 5* hotel and 5* service. Do we regret what we paid? No. Would we go back there? Well, we've always agreed that the world is too large and our time on it too short to waste going back to the same place twice. We've yet to travel to Australasia or Canada (we've travelled most everywhere else) and we've an average age of 57, hubby and I, so the clock's ticking... but, I'm sorely tempted! If the service we received here at the Riu Palace Mexico is indicative of the service we can expect from othr Riu Palace hotels, and I'm going to research that (!) then we'll be reviewing our holiday policy very soon!

Where to start? As you arrive at the hotel the first sight is very impressive - we stayed at the Riu Tequila last year so knew what to expect, but it was still amazing when we arrived. Check in was quick and simple, with the reception staff explaining the layout of the hotel along with how the restaurants worked etc, all with a great fruit and tequila punch - a great start to the holiday. You can either take your own bags or leave in reception for them to be delivered to your room shortly after - your choice. We elected to take them ourselves as we wanted to dump them and explore! As we were there for our wedding we were upgraded to a sea view room which was lovely - the rooms are good. Two beds which were slightly smaller than doubles - we fit both of us in 1 bed quite easily! We've stayed all inclusive on a number of times and it was a nice touch to have the options of room service (although there's so much to see and do it did seem a waste to stay in the room) and toilettries (shampoo, conditioner, moisturiser etc) in the bathrooms. Not huge things but a nice finishing touch. We never really used the optics as spent most of our time out and about, but the fridge was stocked every day with whatever you wanted (a good mix of beers and soft drinks). I've noticed from other reviews that some people were disappointed with the lack of entertainment at the Riu Palace Mexico which I can't really understand. The Palace hotels are the most expenive of the Riu's and you obviously pay for what you get - champagne/fizzy wine, live music every evening, table service in every bar, sunlounger service at the beach, a more relaxed & upmarket feel to the place. If you want something more lively, either during the day or night you can use the Riu Tequila (great pool area, sports bar & disco), Playacar (great for kids entertainment around the pool), or the Lupita. There is also the Riu Palace Riveria Maya about 10 minutes walk up the road. I must admit we stayed at the Palace Mexico for the majority - around the Plaza in the evening until midnight and then up to the air conditioned bar next to reception for more fizz! The hotel were brilliant at organising our wedding. We had a meeting with the wedding planner a couple of days before and chose the venue within the hotel, flowers, cake etc and had our paperwork checked out. A Dr was sent to our room at an allotted time for the blood tests and that was it - sorted! It really was very relaxed and organised - they really are very good at what they do and remove the stress. We ate at all 4 of the speciality restaurants and all were very good - my favourite being the Japanese restaurant - the sushi was especially nice. We were lucky when we arrived as the bookings were being taken at breakfast time at the entrance to the buffet restaurant as the hotel had only just re-opened after the flu outbreak and occupancy was down. Not sure about peoples comments about having to wait as we never had to do this. The beach was lovely - can't complain about the sand whales are they are preserving the beach and if anything actually creat nice calm areas of sea. There is plenty of shade in the trees with hammocks and sun beds, and of course the beach bar! The staff are amazing and nothing is too much trouble, and always a smile. A small tip goes a long way and the service you receive (whether you tip or not) is second to none. Would definitiely go back, and hopefully will be able to do so later this year.

I just wanted to say what a fantastic time we had. We have previously been to the Riu Palace in Cancun and the Riu Cancun. We have always loved Mexico and have been extremely happy with the quality of the Riu hotels, particularly the Palaces. We had an absolute ball...we made the most of all the Riu properties in our vicinity, and felt, without a doubt that ours was the best of the lot. We did enjoy going to the RPRM and using their pool area as it was a nicer pool area than our own but we definitely had the better beach and also felt that our hotel generally was a little more chilled out and relaxing than the others. Don't get me wrong, we like to party as much as anyone but it was nice to opt in and out of a more lively atmosphere. The nightclub at the tequilla was only over the road if we fancied letting our hair down after a few glasses of champagne and then it was easy enough to walk home, knowing that we would have an undisturbed night's sleep once back in the room. Service at this hotel is absolutely excellent...we truly were treated so well. Katy was absolutely brilliant, always stopping for a chat and to find out how things were going on her regular walks around the hotel. Everyone we met were so friendly and not only will we have taken home some special memories but also special friends too...you know who you are!!!!!! We would definitely revisit this hotel. The only one complaint I would have is that one night the buffet served up my most favoured meal ever...massive juicy crab claws. They were so delicious I had them for my Starter, Main and Dessert. Unfortunately we only had them that night....oh well....the other mass selection of seafood and shellfish had to suffice...damn shame (!!!???!!!)

I reported it to the desk and as they couldn't get it repaired straight away, they moved us to an upgraded room opposite the fountains. Every hotel will have it's problems from time to time, it's how they deal with the problems which counts & we couldn't have asked for better service. The food from the specialty restaurants to the buffet service was unbelievable. Anyone who complains about the food at this hotel must have serious dietary problems, because there was always something nice to eat at all times of the day & night. We tried all the special restaurants except the Japanese as it was closed for some of the time we were there. All were brilliant however the best out of the 3 was the Krystal, the food was great & the staff made you fell like a million dollars. The beach was a picture postcard setting, plenty of lovely white sand, loads of sun beds & more importantly shaded areas to keep you out of the baking hot sun.

In Playa del Carmen it was a completely gated community where you felt safe and there were tons of hotels next to each other and alot of happy people.

Everything was so beautiful and clean and staff was very respectful. Our rooms were 2 twin beds pushed together and I knew ahead of time after reading one of these reviews. There was a fully stocked mini bar and fridge full of soda, water, and beer which was completely free! The room was very nice too... can't reallly say anything bad about it. The beach was really nice too. I didn't really see any service there at the beaches from what I've read about, but there's a booth type bar service that makes drinks, but you have to walk there. The water was a bit strong for me.. though I'm not a great swimmer. However, it was packed full of people. There are some women who I've seen gone topless and just walking freely along the beach and people getting undressing. I didn't care, but not sure if it makes those who care uncomfortable. Just an FYI. I didnt' visit the 2 pools. It looked really nice and less crowded. The only annoying part was you HAD to make a reservation for dinner between 8:30 -10:30 otherwise they fill up. It was annoying the first night we got there because they just told us that you can just stop by there to see if anything was open and all of the restaurants except 1, you MUST wear long pants. (no matter if dress or jeans). Well we didn't pack jeans at all because most of the restaurants were outside and it was just soo hot (about 95 degrees and horrible humid weather feeling like you can't breath) So we didn't pack long pants. Also the only time's to eat were ONLY at 6:30 or 8:45. So if you're just checking in around that time you're SOL unless you get room service, which is only salads, fruits, desserts, or sandwichs. So the first night we went to eat we were walking for an hour back and forth to see if anything was available and pretty much had to beg to eat. Overall, besides making reservations to have dinner, it was a great experience and didn't want to go back home at all. Oh for those who say scooters are death traps. THEY are NOT. We took a ferry to Coz and rented them for $20 (but go on their website and print out the screen and get it for $15) It was the funnest thing there.

The fridge and bar were well stocked and filled every day. The food was fantastic especially the buffet which changed themes quite regularly. Our favourite was lunch served in the open sided restaurants by the beach with great views of the spectacular azure sea. We would sip chilled white wine whilst enjoying various fresh salads and Mexican food. We went to 3 of the 4 themed restaurants (missed out the Japanese as my wife is allergic to MSG) and we liked the Steak House, thought the Krystal was fabulous but the Brazilian somewhat ordinary and disappointing. Breakfast was good with lots of choice though after a couple of days we stuck with the fresh fruit as the heat was too much. The pool and swim up bar were clean and good as was the availability of sun beds both at the pool and by the beach with no one reserving them!!! The entertainment guys worked hard and there were lots of activities. My 15 year old daughter and her friend were never bored and made friends with quite a few other teenagers from the UK, Canada and USA. The beach is good and clean though the large sand bags used to protect the beach were buried deeper and not as obvious in 2006. Plenty of water sports for those who want to be more active. The gym was somewhat small and this disappointed me a little as it was quite crowded once 4 or more people were trying to use it. We ended up using it between midday and 2pm when it was usually empty. The hotels strongest point is its staff. Around the pool or at night around the bars you are never more than 5 minutes away of being asked if you need another drink. The service at the restaurants is incredible efficient and courteous.

The last two years we overpaid to stay in Cozumel and were very disappointed, but this year we got a great deal with Riu Palace and got great service as well! The Riu staff was extremely helpful and willing to serve you in any way. After two rather sleepless nights on a rock hard mattress, we asked the staff if they could do anything about it, and immediately they put in a request for the cleaning staff to add mattress pads. The night staff continually looks to refill drinks and get you whatever you need. I thought the entertainment was good most nights - I guess it just depends on your taste. The shows were mostly dancing which is what I like. There was live music each night and they tended to play the same songs, but I thought the band was very good! The beach is absolutely beautiful even though there are ugly wave-barriers about ten feet out. There are many Europeans that come to stay at the Riu's, so prepare to see some cleavage! Also, there are lots of mosquitos esp. at night, so bring bug spray. I loved the fact that there were so many palm trees on the beach so there are shaded and sunny areas. The food is okay - nothing compared to the El Dorado Royale restaurants which changed menus every night, but worth getting up early to make reservations for. Make sure to get the Alaskan flambe if you go to the Steakhouse - it was wonderful!!! We rented a car for two days and visited the towns of Akumal and Tulum. It is so much cheaper and worthwhile to do this rather than book the formal tours. In one day, we went to the Tulum ruins (about $4 pp), visited a local public beach called La Mariachi and drove to downtown Akumal. The next day we went back to Akumal to a free beach called Turtle Beach. There are protected waters where sea turtles frequent. You have to bring your own snorkeling gear, but when we went we saw four large turtles, a stingray and a nurse shark. You could probably do this all in one day if you planned it right.

While no hotel is perfect, I was pretty happy with my experiences at this hotel chain. I expected to have a similar experience at this hotel which is why I didn\u2019t bother to read tripadvisor before booking this vacation. That was a big mistake. If I had read the reviews, I would have known how horrible this hotel was. Rooms: The rooms do not get cool enough. The air conditioning has always been strong when I stayed at other RIU hotels, but it does not work very well here. Maybe they turned down the a.c. to save money. Even with the ceiling fan on, the room is stuffy and uncomfortable. I booked two rooms for 4 people and both rooms had this problem. I enjoyed a Jacuzzi tub at the other RIUs, but this hotel had a regular bathtub. I expected that all Palace hotels would have a Jacuzzi tub since the Palace level is supposedly their highest level. The maids leave the doors open when they clean your room. As a result, insects get in. My sister and I both got multiple insect bites. They will spray your room with bug spray, if you request it. However, when the maid cleans your room the next day, it\u2019s full of bugs again. The problem got so bad that when I saw a can of RAID bug spray on the maid\u2019s cart, I took it and kept it in the room for the rest of the week so I could spray whenever I needed. The linens are also very cheap and rough on the skin and the television is very small for a split level junior suite. Pools: They have two lackluster pools, one baby pool and a Jacuzzi. The pools were very dirty. There seemed to be a thick layer of oil on the surface. During the week I was there, I never saw an employee cleaning the pools. Usually at resorts, they clean the pool at night, but it doesn\u2019t happen here. The pools are not good for lounging. One of the pools has a ledge about 10 feet wide that you can sit on. Otherwise, you have to stand up. The pool areas have always been spacious and beautiful at the other RIU hotels. They had infinity pools, lounge chairs in the water, jacuzzi\u2019s and tables off the swim-up bar. This is another example of how plain this hotel is compared to other RIU hotels. There is a strong odor like raw sewage that starts in the pool area and extends to the beach. It is disgusting. Activities: Staff not as animated as the other resorts. Same ten songs played from the stereo everyday while water aerobics was going on. Other than that, there was no music. There is water polo once a day, if you like that and also bingo once a day for a half hour. Spanish lessons too. But there are no games, trivia contests or dancing like their other hotels. At night, they have music in the courtyard which is very loud from approx. 9-11:30 at night. We had first floor rooms and it prevented us from falling asleep. Dining: I thought the food was better than average. It is similar to other RIU resorts. They are understaffed at the restaurants. It takes a long time to get served at the specialty restaurants because there are only 2 waiters working. Beach: Beach is full of big rocks, which I don\u2019t particularly mind because that\u2019s just part of nature. But the big black sandbags are really an eyesore. There is also an enormous green hose right in front of the hotel\u2019s beach which extends to the ocean. It\u2019s ugly; be sure not to trip over it. Again there is a strong raw sewage odor right next to the beach bar. The smell is nauseating. Animals: We spent a day at the RIU Playacar\u2019s pool which is the next resort over. It is nicer than the Riu Palace Mexico. There was a lot of excitement in one corner of the pool area and the reason was because someone found a snake in the bushes. Another day, back at the RIU Palace Mexico, I heard a woman scream because she thought a snake fell out of a tree onto her. I found this disturbing since I\u2019m afraid of snakes. However, if you like reptiles, you might enjoy it. I saw many weddings take place at the hotel. They hold the services right on the beach. Everyone just stands there and watches in their swimsuits. If you ask me, it\u2019s pretty tacky. If you\u2019re looking for a place to get married, I do not recommend this hotel at all. It\u2019s not nice enough for something that should be so special. I was there is late June and there were hardly any Americans or Canadians there. It was mostly Europeans. There was a lot of topless sunbathing, so if you don\u2019t want to see that, go elsewhere. I don\u2019t know why this particular RIU hotel is so horrible. Maybe it\u2019s older or maybe the company hasn\u2019t spent the money to update it. At any rate, I won\u2019t be spending anymore time or money at the RIU resorts. I learned my lesson and won\u2019t take a chance on this chain anymore.", "Date": "July 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shropshire UK", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant!! You have to go\u201d", "Author": "GAKM2009", "ReviewID": "UR34222861", "Content": "I am so pleased we decided to go ahead with our trip despite the flu scare, having previously stayed at the Tequila 3 years ago we knew the area and location of the palace. An honest review of the hotel... here goes: Our check in was smooth and the reception staff were most courteous and spoke excellent english, upon checking us in I happened to ask as an off the cuff remark whether or not we had been given the pool view room I had \"requested\" at the time of booking, (first time I have ever made a request) the young lady said she would check for us, as it happened we hadn't got a pool view (we were in the rooms that backed onto the walkway running between the tequila and the beach, seems they put most people there to start with), but she said she would do what she could to try and get us moved next morning as the hotel was full that evening. I really didn't expect anything to come of it but to her credit 15 minutes after going into our room she rang to say the bell boy would be up next morning to move our luggage as she had allocated us 2 rooms with a pool view. We were moved to a room overlooking the pool & fountains, a truly beautiful view. The hotel was not up to full capacity due to the flu scare and as such I think the variety of food was possibly not as plentiful as it would normally be, though we did see this improve as our stay continued due to more guests arriving daily, by the time we left the menu had increased quite significantly. The buffet restaurant caters for all and the food is plentiful, the waiters cannot do enough for you. The speciality restaurants are excellent we tried them all, there is a booking system which does seem a bit odd you have to go the the theatre bar and pick up a ticket (next door to the main buffet reastaurant), they start giving out tickets at 8am but you then have to sit and wait for the bookings to begin at 8:30, works okay but can't see why they just don't don't take the reservation at 8 rather than give out a ticket but as I said it works so no problem, after all you're on your holidays so there's no rush! The rooms are spotlessly clean and the maids are very thorough, They also do a turn down service at night which is quite nice. Towels and toiletries are in plentiful supply. The mini bar in the room is constantly kept well stocked as are the optics, not that we used the optics ourselves. The drinks are all branded names and they do a lovely baileys coffee in the lobby bar even though it isn't on the menu, they will do just about any drink you ask for. There are plenty of beds and umbrellas around the pools and on the beach, there is waiter service around the pool and on the beach the waiter comes round frequently with a tray of ready made drinks for you to choose from. All in all they cannot do enough for you and genuinly seem to enjoy doing so. The entertainment isn't up to much but then this seems to be the case wherever you go, the lobby bar is popular at night there is a pianist there and it is a place to have a very relaxing drink, there is the Tequila 2 minutes walk away if you fancy something a bit more lively, and of course you can go into any of the other RIU's there, we tried them all however the Lupita was closed for most of our stay only re-opening a day or so before we left therefore we didn't get to see that one. In our opinion the Palace Mexico was by far the best of the bunch even better than the Riviera Maya the new palace further down the street. As a guest of the palace hotel you are also entitled to go into the RIU's in Cancun we visited them also and again preferred ours. There is a shopping/bars area 5 minutes taxi ride away at a cost of 5 dollars, well worth a trip, we took a local bus to Cancun it is totally safe to go out on your own and though this time we didn't do any of the trips this yime we spoke to many others that had organised their own with the local tour companys and had excellent results even going on the same bus as the guests who had booked via our holiday rep and as a result paid almost half price for the same trip. What more can I say the place and staff are amazing and I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone.

It was just myself and my boyfriend (in our 30s) Seemed like most of the guests were older and we saw a lot of families.

Pool bar was great. The cons - The food was just OK. the reservation restaurants such as the krystal and the Japanese one were slightly better than the buffet but nothing amazing. Room service was just ok. Very limited menu. There are a lot of people trying to sell you on tours and excursions on the beach.

There are plenty of palm trees to put your lounger under and since we had no rain during our stay and the temp was in the mid-80's the shade was appreciated. There is no reason to save a chair, there were always plenty available. I can't say much about the pool since we spent most of our time on the beach. The beach bar was very good and we were served by waiters most of the time. The rooms are spacious and very clean. The cleaning staff comes in at least 2 x's a day. The food is good, my complaint (as is many others) is their reservation system. We only made it to the Steakhouse which was quite good. The other thing to keep in mind is men have to wear long pants in all the restaurants, including the buffet. We didn't know this ahead of time so my husbands 2 pair of pants got quite a workout.

For anyone that is worried about violence in Mexico...there was absolutely none to speak of! I rely on TripAdvisor tremendously to guide me in picking a resort so I am loyal to providing an honest review for all of you! This Riu is beautiful...the grounds are well kept and the beach is gorgeous! Tons of shade under palm trees and tons of sunshine closer to the water - plenty of lounge chairs! (Note: the beach is topless, which I wasn't expecting and with 2 little boys I was a bit worried but, they didn't seem to notice after a while :o) The pool did not meet our expectations. The pictures I saw were deceiving. It appeared as though the pool was a complete circle and you could swim around the whole thing. this is not the case - it's actually 2 U shaped pools. It also appears much, much more grandiose than it actually is.....we were shocked! It was also a VERY boring pool...absolutely no activities going on in or around it and the view (because it was U shaped) was very boring! We spent all of our pool time at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya, which has a BEAUTIFUL, more active pool (and you could see the whole pool from one chair vs. staring at a wall :o) Now...I need to clarify the word \"active\" pool...we went to Cancun last year and stayed at a resort that had the most entertaining pool ever! Contests, games, constant entertainment - my kids (6 and 8) had a blast...even if they couldn't participate in some of it, it was fun for them to watch! You don't get anything like that at these resorts. Outside of water aerobics in the a.m. and water volleyball, there is absolutely NOTHING going on. In addition to that, the kids club at the Riu Palace Mexico was run down, always closed and the extent of it was a Little Tykes type playground. The Riu Palace Riviera Maya was pretty much the same thing but, was open a bit more. These kids clubs are designed for children 4 and under at best. There is no activities for kids 6-12 and what they did have (ping pong, darts, horeshoes) was so unorganized and sporadic that we only caught an actual organized activitiy (soccer) at the Riviera Maya 2x. Last year, we received a list of activities for the entire week that we could keep in our room and it kept the kids sooo busy! I did leave a comment card at the Riu advising that they need to utilize their entertainment crew because for us.....we probably wouldn't go back to this resort with our children. Also - at the Riu Palace Mexico both ends of the pools had standing water.....well, let me correct myself...one end had standing water with a water fountain but, it was really gross and I think kids used it to pee in. The other end (opposite the swim-up bar) was suppose to hold the 'jacuzzi' but was filled in with rocks and not functional. It was really an eye-sore. The food was great! The beach was clean and beautiful! The maid service was outstanding! The shows at night were okay - not great (again compared to last year) but, good - with the exception of the Michael Jackson show, which was outstanding! The street that the 5 Rius is located is very quaint and safe. There is a shopping plaza and Starbucks diagnol from the Riu Palace Mexico, which was very nice with absolutely NOONE begging you to buy anything! If you stay at the Mexico or Riviera Maya you can go to all 5 resorts BUT, beware that if you stay at the other 3 you can NOT go to the Mexico or Riviera Maya and they ENFORCE it. We had friends come over to our pool from the Riu Tequila and they were actually stopped at the lunch buffet and told they couldn't eat because the food is better, the wine is better, etc. than the Tequila. It was embarassing for them so just beware not to try it! :o) We went on the Mini speed boat/ATV excursion ($250 for 4 ppl)....we were told it was 15 min. away and it was more like an hour and 15 minutes. The ATV ride was okay but, the mini-speed boats were actually small speed boats that you cruise around the ocean in. I can't drive a boat and get motion sick so this was a very long 45 minutes for me! If you like to work out...none of the gyms are great but, the Riu Yucatan had the best one. 5th Avenue is a MUST ($5 taxi ride there) but, well worth it! Lots of very nice shopping and great restaurants (Sr. Frogs, Carlos N Charlies, Los Rancheros); this is also where you can take the Ferry to Cozumel. If you are planning to work while there....the business center doesn't open til 8am so bring your laptop if you want to work earlier than that. Also - our cell phones did not work at all in our room.......sporadically on the beach but, were fine in the lobby! All in all....how can you NOT be happy when Mexico is such a serene place to be...the sun is always shining, the people are so friendly and the beach is breathtaking but, when you are spending $1000s of dollars you should be sure you get exactly what you are looking for. So........if you are looking for a beautiful beach, peaceful surroundings, breathtaking gardens, fountains and landscape.....the Riu Palaces are great! If you have young children.....you can definitely find someplace with a lot more for them to do! We heard the Iberostar Riviera Maya was great for kids but, we dropped people off at this resort on the way to our resort the day we arrived and it's about 2 miles off the main road and pretty far from actual downtown Playa Del Carmen (5th Ave)....the Rius are located right IN Playa del Carmen on the cutest little cobblestone type street!

Pros: I would like to also add the food in the buffets were really good during breakfast, lunch & dinner. You could also eat at the restaurants you must make a reservation for. we ate at a different one each night, and i would have to highly recommend the Brazilian Restaurant, unbelievable, couldn't eat it all. I would like to clarify on the dress code at all of the buffets and restaurants. During the breakfast & lunch servings men must wear at least a tank top, women must wear a full cover over there bathing suits and all must wear at least sandels. At dinner all men must wear long pants, at least a t-shirt with sleeves. On there web-site it said women had to wear formals. I noticed in the restaurants you must make a reservation for some women wore shorts and both must wear at least sandels. On the reservations for dinner. There is a 6:30 dinner or an 8:30 dinner you must chose which one, the early dinner reservations go pretty quick. Now they tell you not to be late, there's only seating for about 50 people and the first dinner has to wrap up so they can get ready for the late dinner. After about 10-15 minutes after they let you in they lock the doors, but it never fails, couples and familys that are late are knocking on the door trying to get in when we've already started. I even heard them arguing with the door man. They were not allowed in, now for being late, there eating at the buffet. i would recommend this Riu Hotel if your going to visit Cozumel which we did, the beaches over there are awesome. If it wasn't for the visit to Cozumel I would prefer one of the Riu Hotels in Cancun. More things to do pretty much within walking distance of everything. The only paroblem we had, had nothing to do with the Riu Palace. It was with the taxi service. We decided to spend the day at the Riu Americana in Cancun. On the way the driver must have known of another way because I wasn't familiar in the direction he was going but thought he must know a different way. My wife is fluent in Spanish and so was a friend of ours wife, he explained that he was going out of his jursidiction and other companys kind of frown about it. He asked when he dropped us off that we pay him behind the van so the other hotel and taxi drivers wouldn't see. We agreed on $120.00 U.S. round trip before we started, but my partner only gave him $60.00 U.S. and told him he would receive the balance with a generous tip after he takes us back to our hotel. He dropped us off at about 9:30 and agreed to pick us up at 4:00 at the Starbucks across the street. When the day was done we ended up at the Starbucks at 3:50 for the taxi. 4:30 no taxi, 5:00 still no taxi. My wife and some friends went across the street to the Riu Cancun and asked them to call our hotel to ask what happened to our taxi. They contacted the driver and said his van broke down. The van he took us in was brand new. Now the Riu Cancun abliged us and got us another taxi to take us back to our Hotel, one way back was $100.00, what are you going to do, we paid it. On the way on the main highway that I was familiar with about half way there he had to pull over to this little office and said he had to check in. When he got back my wife asked him about the checking in. He says that all taxi cab drivers going out of there district have to check in to tell them where there taking us, show proof of insurance and take a sobriety test. On the way up to Cancun that's why our taxi cab driver took a route to by pass the check point for taxi drivers. He also told us that when we were dropped off he was supposed to go in the Riu Americana and tell them where's he coming from and how many people he dropped off, he didn't do that either. The Starbucks we were waiting at there's a parking lot for out of area taxi cabs that have to wait there until there guests are aready to go back. Your taxi driver must wait for you and your party until your done, he' not supposed to leave it doens't matter if your there for 5 minutes or 5 hours. Our driver pocketed the money. A suggestion, agree on this before you get in the taxi, if it's a round trip fair, don't pay him until he completes the trip, do not pay anything for halfway, he may not be coming back", "Date": "April 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cHad a great time but gained weight!\u201d", "Author": "JBien", "ReviewID": "UR27732155", "Content": "My husband and I wanted a quick getaway to relieve some work-related stress and take advantage of the travel industry's bargains due to the economy. We spent 5 days and 4 nights at the Riu Palace Mexico in Playacar. We have stayed at Riu properties before, and knew what to expect as far as the hotel concept goes. At Riu properties, everyone has access to the same pools, same alcohol brands and same restaurants. You can book the cheapest room in the place and still have access to all the same amenities as those who book the fancy rooms; there isn't a Royal Club, or an Elegance Club that you have to pay extra for. Having said that, this trip was more pricey than going someplace else in the Caribbean, like Punta Cana, or Puerto Rico. The room alone was $192 per person per night. If you book a vacation package, it might bring the rate down somewhat, but we had vouchers for airfare, so we just paid for the hotel. The hotel is decorated in British colonial style decor, though the architecture of the buildings was Spanish in style. There is a center courtyard with beautiful fountains that go all the way down toward the pool, and the promenade down toward the pool was covered with mature, tall palm trees, offering a great shady walk to the pool. The pool is a crazy shape with a bar side (that has a volleyball net and lots of kids, for some reason) and a quiet side without the bar. The pool has not only a swim-up bar, but a walk-up bar as well. There are several bar tenders at the pool bar, but wait staff that take care of those folks that are sitting around the pool. I recommend the mud slide, or the Bailey's Irish Coffee. By the way, both the bar tenders and the wait staff were fantastic. Always a smile, always attentive. And they worked their butts off. The beach itself is a gorgeous beach. There are TONS of palm trees scattered around the beach on the hotel property, and the Riu Palace Mexico has the best beach hands down. You can walk to the other Riu properties and see for yourself, but you'll notice lots of folks from the other Riu properties will end up on the beach in front of the Palace Mexico. Though, be careful if you aren't a guest of the Riu Palace Mexico - they check your wrist band, and if you are not a guest of a Riu Palace property, they won't serve you. Many folks on this website have reported that the sand is worn away on this stretch of beach. This is very true. But the Riu Palace Mexico has more sand than most hotels in the area and the beach is mostly intact. There are places where the sand whales (large sandbags the size of city buses) are buried under the beach to help keep the sand in place, but they are exposed a little bit. But that's okay - the beach area is still very nice, and its obvious that they are trying to keep the beach intact and protect it from further erosion. The large sand whales are also out in the water, creating a sort of safe place for swimming. However, the waves still pound those sand whales relentlessly and on some days, the waves were so strong, they would come over the top of the sand whales by several feet. I've attached some pictures of how rough the waves got. I wouldn't advise taking a toddler into the waves when high tide comes in. The waves are most calm in the morning hours, but pick up substantially by noon, when high tide comes in. The water was a wee bit chilly, but you got used to it really quickly. It's still that same shade of gorgeous turquoise. We were in room 2054. The room was as we expected it, after staying in other 'Palace' category Riu properties; a junior suite with a love seat, coffee table and dresser with a TV on it, and two double beds pushed together in a separate area. The TV was a Sony Bravia flat screen which was great quality. There were several channels in English to include most major cable news channels. The TV just didn't pivot (or swivel) so we couldn't watch it from the rest of the room; you couldn't see the TV unless you were directly in front of it. There was a coffee maker in the bathroom which some great coffee and Carnation-brand creamer. The bar was refilled every day (which was good, since we were drinking the 7UP the fastest) and the toiletries were replenished if we used them. They offer to replace your towels like most hotels claim to: If your towel is hanging up, they don't change it. If your towel is on the floor, they exchange it. They actually adhered to that. Few hotels I've been in actually DO what their little placard actually states. The airconditioner kept up at night, and the room was cool at night, though sometimes damp. The damp smell didn't permeate this room as it did in Punta Cana. This room was less humid as well. Our room had a tiny little balcony since our room was a little bigger, but most folks had larger balconies. I would have traded our room for a room with more of a balcony since the weather was so pleasant at night. We had little patio furniture to fit on our little patio. Unlike our balcony, the \"normal\" balconies had larger lounge chairs on their patios ... gee, sure would've liked to have one of those rooms ... ;) The food! OMG. I gained 4 pounds in 5 days, even though hubby and I did cardio every morning in their gym. Aack! But we ate at Don Julio's every day for breakfast and for dinner. And there was ALWAYS something fantastic to eat. I must preface this review with the fact that my fave food is Mexican, being from Texas. Fresh-made tortillas, wonderful chicken enchilada soup, tortilla soup, hot gorditas/flautas, etc. Don't get me wrong, there were other amazing dishes for dinner as well: spit-roasted whole turkey one night, outstanding paella, grilled seafood (like shrimp and lobster), asparagus soup, beef steaks (though I'm uncertain of the cut of steak), amazing prime rib that was cooked just right at the carving station, creamy and very tasty farfalle pasta in alfredo sauce. Several nights they had a guy cooking crepes while you wait. He would fill them with what ever you wanted; creme freche, bananas, home-made caramel, chocolate bits, etc. Holy smokes .... it melted in your mouth. And he always had a line. We OD'd on those one night; we couldn't quit eating them. I must admit that I didn't exactly eat much veggies or salad while I was there, which contributed to my expanded waist line, I'm sure. But with so many great aromas in that restaurant, I couldn't help myself. Dang, I'm making myself hungry just remembering the food. Breakfast was the standard fare: all kinds of different eggs, charizo/potato mixture with sauteed onions, bacon (not really sliced bacon; it was more like shaved bacon which made me go crazy with it), a variety of different toasts, lox and bagels, cheeses of all kinds, huevos rancheros, migas, cereals, yogurt (try the mango yogurt, it's great). I'm a big breakfast eater (well, let me say I'm a believer in having a good solid breakfast) and I ate myself stupid at breakfast, knowing that I don't usually eat lunch. This breakfast was great. You could have mimosas, coffee, all different kinds of juices (try their guava) at the fresh juice station, fresh milk with all the cream (which was honestly quite good!); this meal was my second fave of the day, with dinner being my first fave meal of the day. The wait staff at Don Julio's were really great. They worked their butts off running here and there to get you drinks, take away plates, make you cafe con leche, etc. We liked to sit in German's station (pronounced Herman) and Daniel's section. Both waiters were real polite, very nice, very attentive. I have to admit that we left the safe in our room open while we went to breakfast one morning, and housekeeping came. Elitsita, our housekeeper, didn't touch anything; all our passports, money, jewelry was still there. I don't think we got \"lucky\". I think there are still good-hearted people out there that are genuinely honest. Elitsita got a nice tip from us upon checkout, not just for that, but for also being friendly to us and being so responsive. Here's my only complaint (that I'll be sharing with the Riu in a letter) about this hotel. If you book your reservation directly with the Riu website, you get \"free transfers\" to and from the hotel from a 3rd party called HotelBeds Services and Attractions. You have to provide your flight details for your arriving flight and your departure flight (like, airline, flight number, arrival/departure time, etc) and the number of passengers with you when you make your reservation. You are emailed travel vouchers that you are supposed to present to the HotelBeds rep upon arrival into Cancun International Airport. You should know that this is what's called \"shared van service\" which means it's like a Super Shuttle. Many people share a van and the driver drops you all off in a pre-determined order based on where you're staying. We were kept waiting for an hour for other passengers due to arrive on another flight. We hadn't anticipated that we'd be waiting an hour just to get into a van. But after an hour, we started getting fussy, and refused to 'go have a seat'. Instead, we stood right by the HotelBeds podium in front of the other HotelBeds customers (and potential customers), which prompted the HotelBeds rep to put us onto a van by another tour company called Aventura Tours. I guess he didn't want surly-looking guests ruining potential business. The Aventura Driver was very nice and he had us to our hotel in an hour. While we were at theRiu, we were constantly bugged by the HotelBeds rep who said we had an \"orientation\" at a specific time. Heck, we came on vacation to get away from meetings, and I'm not about to sit in another meeting while we're on VACATION. So we ignored her calls. Then one day, she called at 7 AM waking us up and insisting that we come to an orientation. I debated with her on the following points: Me- I already have a voucher with a scheduled departure time, so why do I need to come see you? (knowing she wanted to waste our time by attempting to sell us excursions we didn't want) Her - So I can get your return flight information for the return transfer. Me - I already provided that information when I booked my reservation, so you should have that information. Her - No I don't have that information. I need you to come to the HotelBeds desk. Me - Then I can give you that information over the phone. Her - Well, I'll need your signature Me - For what? Her - For the transfers. See the circular argument? We get up, go to the desk (mind you, we're not happy) she sees us but is with another customer booking an excursion. She's already got a customer on the hook and doesn't care about us who are simply scheduling return transfers, so she ignores us. We wait 15 minutes, and we're both glaring at her from 5 feet away. Seeing that we might ruin her business with our presence, she asks if we are so-and-so, and we tell her yes. She asks for our return flights, at which time I hand her the voucher from HotelBeds that I received via email containing not only our return flight and time, but a scheduled van arrival time to pick us up from the Riu. She writes this information down, explains where we should wait for the van, and we leave. Wow. This was the only irritating thing out of the whole trip, and it's not the fault of the Riu, though they should know who they're doing business with because I certainly won't be using HotelBeds in the future. For anything. We later found out that a private taxi would have been $50 (negotiable) for two each way. I would highly recommend going with a taxi instead in the future. It might save you a headache and an early wake-up call. Everyone from check in (thank you to Laura at the reception desk) to check out was really friendly and really made us feel welcome while we were there. I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends or family heading down to Mexico. It's not Palatial, but rather it's a cozy, beautiful hotel with outstanding service and great amenities.", "Date": "April 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cA little dated, but something for everybody!\u201d", "Author": "maribel922", "ReviewID": "UR27645679", "Content": "My husband and I recently returned from our trip to RIU Palace Mexico, and since I spent a lot of time reading these reviews prior to our trip, I thought I'd throw my two cents in. Overall, we loved our stay at the RIU Palace Mexico. Based on past TripAdvisor review, I wrote the manager a few weeks prior to our trip and requested a fountain view room, but they never responded. Although not a fountain view, per se, we did have a view of the courtyard above the main buffet, which was a nice room (not sure if this was because of my email or what), HOWEVER thankfully we aren't the sort to go to bed prior to 11pm, as the music in the courtyard was very loud for the nightly entertainment and lasts until 11. We were impressed with the evening entertainment each night and loved having something to do after dinner on site. The property and grounds at the hotel are overall very nice, but I agree with past reviews that the hotel is showing its age a bit in the pool area. The pool is not as big or as nice as the RPRM, nor has as close proximity to the beach like RPRM. It really didn't bother me much, but if you are a \"pool person\" you may want to consider the RPRM or the Yucatan. We were easily able to find chairs under the palm trees close to the water every day and enjoyed looking out of the ocean. The hotel food was great. There is a buffet open all afternoon close to the water, so you can go load up on a salad or guacamole or pizza as a break from your lounging. There really is something for everyone at the morning and evening buffet in the main hotel. The quality of the food was great and lots of variety. We ate at Krystal one night and found the food and experience to be excellent. The other night we went to the Brazilian steakhouse and it was \"just okay.\" The meat was fine, but it was a little rinky dink. Certainly no Fogo de Chao. We had no problems making reservations for the restaurants after we ate breakfast around 9, but the morning we went down around 10, all that was open was one spot in the Brazilian steakhouse, which we declined as per our first experience. We did go down to RIU Palace RM one day and the hotels are very similar in kind of a Seinfeld \"Bizarro\" world sort of way. The restaurants are in the same areas of the hotel, have similar names and the hotels both have a similar layout. The pool area for RM was much larger and nicer, but beyond that, the only differences we could see beyond that was in clientele. RPM had far more Europeans and Midwesterners (in our one day observation). RPRM seemed way more American overall, and especially lots of New Yorkers (maybe there was a NJ special, we don't know). :) We loved being exposed to the different cultures at RPM, but definitely saw a lot of topless sunbathing going on (and quite out in the open- an 80 year old grandma thought nothing of feeding the gulls topless- ha), so parents bringing children not accustomed to this may want to plan ahead. This was a getaway trip for my husband and I; our first trip \"away\" from our 10 month old. It was a lovely escape. The drinks weren't watered down, there was top shelf liquour available, if requested and overall the service was fantastic. I spent most of my trip drinking mojitos and they were divine. You didn't feel like you needed to tip, but it was generally appreciated if you did. We discussed our top 3 recommendations for the hotel one night and it would be this: 1. Update beds. I know a lot of previous reviewers said the mattresses were hard and then improved. I found our beds to be hard and covered with a plastic sheety thing and scratchy sheets. I missed my bed at home a lot. 2. Cabana servers on the beach and more of them at the pool. The last day we were there, there was a man walking around with a variety of drinks on a tray, but the other days we were there there was no cabana service at the beach. Not a big deal to go get your own drink, as there is a bar right on the beach, but it would be nicer if there was better cabana service. 3. General overhaul of the pool area, as previously noted. 4. More central bar/gathering space. The outdoor area where the nightly entertainment is located is okay, but it would be nice to create more of a central bar/gathering area like they have at the RIU Tequila across the street. Tequila is a fun place for a change of scene in nightly entertainment and they have a hopping bar. RPM has great entertainment, but people are sort of all over the place. Tequila is fun people watching for an evening cocktail and you can just walk across the street. They also have a nightclub that opens late in the evening like 11:30 or so.", "Date": "April 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "stuart", "Title": "\u201cSpring break with my college sons fishing for marlin\u201d", "Author": "mlibratore", "ReviewID": "UR27616109", "Content": "We booked two rooms for 5 adults one room for 3 college boys and one deluxe suite for my wife and I.

Check in was handled very quickly and even asking for a change of floor did not cause the front desk clerk any distress. Our rooms were on the 3rd floor overlooking the walkway used by the Riu Tequila guests to get to the beach. There was no noise associated with the location. Compared to many other upscale resorts I have stayed at I was slightly dissappointed with the pool area. There was very little shade so we chose to spend more time at the beach where they seemed to be more palms and intimate areas. There was never an issue with getting loungers. Plenty were always available and could be easily manouvered into the right spot. Even being quite a distance from the ocean provided us with great vistas. Plenty of hammocks were also scattered about in and amongst the palms. On most of the days we were at Riu Palace the breezes were quite strong therefore making the waves quite large. The life guards were always blowing their whistles to get people off the large black \"whale\" sandbags so they would not get injured. I did not see it but heard that a young teen had gotten knocked off one of them and broke his leg. I would think it could happen very easily. The beach is coming back with the help of the sand bags. It is much wider than a few years ago. As you walk south from the Riu Palace there are points of the beach where the surf has cut into the beach leaving a 2 to 3 foot drop off. With the winds beating the water onto the beach you can appreciate why this has happened. It did not seem to bother anyone who was a beach walker however. One day we walked all the way from our hotel to the border of the Occidental Grand Xcaret resort's beach. It was several miles each way and a beautiful walk. We were surprised to see an exceptional number of college aged spring breakers at this property. I own a travel agency and this is normally a property that attracts this demographic. I will say on the whole they were very well behaved. We always enjoyed watching them play volleyball at the beach court. It provided a lot of entertainment. Periodically we did see them with adults so we assumed they were not booked into the hotel on their own, but had chaperones. There was one incident that did have me wondering why they allowed younger people into this upscale hotel however. One night at about 3am on our floor a group of breakers emptied 5 or 6 of the hotels fire extinguishers all down the corridor. Our friends heard the commotion but did not feel they should open their door for security reasons. When we left our room for breakfast we seen about 1/2 an inch of a fine gray sandy powder absolutely all over everything. At the time we could not figure out what had happened. After breakfast when we went to the lobby to retrieve emails my husband went to the front desk to inquire what had happened outside our room. He was told that multiple fire extinguishers has been discharged and it would be cleaned up immediately. I must give kudos to the staff because by the time we came back from the beach around 3pm it was virtually spotless. They worked tirelessly to clean all the wrought iron railings, the wood work, and the floors to their previous condition. Because the extinguishers were no longer in their places it made you hope their was not going to be a fire. My final thought is that I would have hoped the hotel's security would have caught this before it got out of hand. In this I was dissappointed in Riu's management. I am even more dissappointed with the imature people who did it. We were for the most part happy with the food and drinks. I was quite concerned before I got to the resort about having to make reservations each morning for that evenings a la carte but it proved to be very simple. After breakfast around 820am we simply crossed the courtyard to the theatre / lounge area and got a number from one of the staff. At 830am they started calling out numbers and guests would simply go up to a table, give the name of their restaurant of choice for that evening, give their preferred time, and the number of guests, get a reservations slip, and you were on your way. We ate at the steak house, the Japanese, and the gourmet restaurants. The service at each was very good. As someone mentioned in an earlier review it did seem like many of the appetizers were pre made and therefore not as hot as they could have been. The buffet selections at breakfast and lunch were very good. and presented well. If someone couldn't find something to eat then truly they should not leave home! None of us were a big fan of the coffee. Adding hot water or lots of milk didn't seem to help so we either switched to the instant coffee they had on hand or had tea. The service at the lobby bar was exceptional. Even when I ordered my special drink concoction it was not a problem. For something different try a Mad Max. One part of Malibu rum, one part of Amaretto, and then a few spashes of orange juice in a tall glass over ice. Delicious!!!!!! In regard to the room I felt it was comfortable for the most part. I still am not a big fan of the Riu bed configuration. I have yet to figure out why they put two double beds together with one giant wood headboard? I would enjoy a true king bed more and I am sure families staying in one room would prefer two separate doubles. I also could not figure out why the safe was installed at knee level in the closet. Having to bend over to put things in and out was a pain. By the way the safe did hold a large lap top. We had no complaints about our mini bar. It was stocked with lots of everything and we loved that they had Dos Equis beer. It is one of our favorites in Mexico. The coffee maker and supplies to make coffee in the morning was also a great touch. We made coffee every morning in the room and it was much better than the restaurant stuff. The location of this property is superb. We had a car throughout our stay but even if we didn't have a vehicle it is very easy to get into Playa del Carmen. Many people walked into town. A taxi into town would be quite affordable as well. All of us, along with multiple other guests enjoyed the fact that the resort has free wi fi in the lobby and lobby bar areas. If someone did not have their own lap top there were also about 5 or 6 computers on a pay for minutes basis at the one end of the lobby bar.

The pool and swim up bar excellent. Rooms and all other areas, always clean. Weather fabulous. The staff, especially the activities coordinators were awesome! Entertainment was so-so. Food was a little bit to be desired, but it was ok overall. There were not many kids, but there were facilities for kids. Not a place I would take my kids. The shopping and nightlife in Playa Del Carmen excellent. Must go to Coco Bongos. Lots of trips, excursions and culture to experience and keep you busy if you wanted to venture out. The community where the hotel was gated and therefore felt very safe at all times. This vacation overall was 5 plus all around even though we were bumped to somewhere we did not want to be.

The resort is large and roomy, it was completely full but never felt crowded like the other nearby Riu properties ( the Yucatan, Tequila, and Playacar). It is a nice option to be able to use the facilities at the other resorts, some of the other pools were larger. The bar seemed very small at the Palace, but that is because the service is outstanding, you don't need to go to the bar to get your own drink, a server came by at the pool or on the beach about every 15 minutes. The hotel rooms and the grounds are IMMACULATE, very well-kept . Other reviews mentioned the hard beds: the hotel has put mattress toppers on all the beds, so it was confortable. The rooms are nicely appointed with a wetbar stocked with Dos Equis beer, a variety of Pepsi products and bottled water, enough water for coffee and brushing teeth (we avoided Montezuma's revenge!). Also a liquor dispenser with vodka, tequila, whiskey, and brandy. We talked to another guest who asked for Kahlua to put in his coffee, they sent the whole bottle to his room. This resort has the best beach area of all the neighboring properties-- large, plenty of palm trees, alot of chairs, they even had a lunch barbeque on the beach. The other resorts have a much smaller beach area. There are large sand bags to help stop erosion, but they are not obstructive. Check-in and check-out were quick and smooth, they asked at check-in if we had any special occasions. I mentioned my husbands 50th birthday later that week. On his birthday, they decorated the room with balloons and a \"cake\" made out of towels, they gave him a little gift and a card, they traced which restaurant we were eating at and had a birthday cake, sang , gave us champagne, decorated the table with rose petals--it was great!! The resort is located in Playacar, a gated private community of homes, condos, and hotels---very safe. There is a small shopping area down the street, and it is an easy 2 mile walk into Playa del Carmen. If you don't want to walk, it is a $5 cab ride. The location is close to the ruins at Tulum, Xcaret park and Xel-ha snorkelling. There is always someone in the lobby to arrange these tours for you. The food is good, I don't think the specialty restaurants are necessarily worth waiting an hour to make reservations every morning, the buffet is good with a different theme each night. The \"gala\" night had lobster and beef Wellington. The food is very similar to a cruise ship. There are shows each night at 9:45, I'm not a big show fan, I thought they were pretty lame, but that's a personal preference. They have a nice piano bar in the lobby and a disco across the street at the Tequila. Okay, lets talk price: we got a great deal on the 'net-- 7 days, 6 nights, non-stop air from Cincinnati, and of course the resort is all-inclusive, all for $2200 including taxes, transfers, gratuities. GREAT PRICE!!!! Especially for February!

We were actually booked at the Riu Yucatan but were upgraded to the Riu Palace at check-in. The Palace had a much nicer lobby than the Yucatan- it was more elegant and air conditioned rather than open air. The room was a jr. suite- 2 double beds and a small sitting area with a couch. The room had a musty smell- but many beach resorts do. The maids always did a great job cleaning up the room. The pool was large but very quiet. Alot of people were seniors. I would suggest going next door to the Yucatan's pool if you want a more lively atmosphere. At the Palace pool, I was glad that you could get out to the pool after 12pm and still find a lawn chair. I was not very happy with the food at this resort. At least with the buffets (breakfast, lunch, & dinner), the selection was large enough that you could find something that tasted decent. For the reservation only restaurants, you have to wake up at 8:30am to try to get a table. They have 2 seatings 6:30pm and 8:45pm. It is not worth wasting your time to try to eat at one of these restaurants. We ate at Miyagi, the Japanese restaurant, one night. We thought it was terrible. The food didn't seem freshly prepared and the sauces used on the entrees were just not good. We tried the Brazilian restaurant, La Bodega, another night. It was terrible too. The meats were fatty and just didn't have decent taste. Maybe we are spoiled because we have so many outstanding restaurants in Houston, TX, but I would rate the specialty restaurants at the Palace below average. After dinner, the bar over at the Riu Tequila (across the street from the Palace) is more happening than the bar at the Palace. The disco- La Pinata- opens up at 11pm- at Riu Tequila. It's small but fun. We never checked out the other \"gold\" property- the Riviera Maya. We did walk through the Riu Playacar. It seemed older. They had 2 small pools that seemed to be mostly shaded by all the trees around them.

I had emailed the resort in advance hoping to avoid a ground level room & requesting the north side of the resort w/a courtyard view.

I kindly asked if there might be any 1st or 2nd floor rooms available & voila, we were in luck. Thank you Shannon!! (I hope you received the envelope that I left for you when we checked out.) Our 1st floor room (1133) was very nice & quite suitable for us. I also would rather have had a king size bed versus the two beds pushed together, but of course, we made due. After all, it was only for a week. I don\u2019t think any of the rooms have a walk in shower, but that would have been preferable over the tub. There was always plenty of hot water & good pressure in the shower. The room was cleaned perfectly every day & the mini fridge was also restocked every day. We were happy to leave a daily tip because the room was so well kept each day. As previously noted on other reviews, the grounds are indeed beautiful & very well maintained. We stayed on the beach each day & didn\u2019t really take time to experience the pool area. There were plenty of beach lounge chairs available in the sun or the shade. So, didn\u2019t have to worry about getting out early to save chairs. There are various activities to get involved in if you are so inclined. Or, if you just want to relax & read (which I did) there are quieter spots to do that too. We are not picky eaters & loved the buffet. Special thanks to German for all his excellent service & attention. (I hope you received the envelop we left for you.) We also tried the Steak & Brazilian restaurants & found the food very good & the atmosphere just fine for us. Although, limiting the reservations to just one a day was a bit inconvenient. My husband is a scuba diver & he did go out with the dive operation there at the resort his first day of diving. But, his preference is go out with smaller groups. So, we went in to Playa to book the rest of his dives for the week with a dive operation that he used the last time we were in Playa Del Carmen, Beach Divers. My husband finds the people there to be very friendly & accommodating. This is our 8th year going to the Playa area & the fourth different all inclusive resort that we\u2019ve visited. I would say that the Riu Palace Mexico is our new favorite!! We walked around the other nearby Riu resorts and for the most part, they looked pretty nice as well.

You are granted privileges at all of the Playacar Riu's so we went to Riu Palace Riviera Maya to compare. Both facilities are large and impressive. Excellently maintained and visually attractive. They take cleanliness to an art form. I have never been anywhere cleaner in 15+ trips to Mexico. Food at both was very good. Only a food snob would criticize the overall effort. Lots of variety. Excellent bakery goods and abundant fresh fruit and salads at all times. Beaches are the best in Playa. Both have large sandy areas between the hotel and the Caribbean planted heavily with coconut palms for shade and beauty. Pools - Riviera Maya has hands down the better pool. Many great features including an infinity pool area, loungers in the shallow water and multiple step entrances. If you are a pool person, it will be worth your while staying there just for the better pool. And yes, the pool at Mexico does have an odor. It seems to emanate from an exhaust fan on the side of the pool building where the pool chemicals are mixed and added to the water. You need to stay up wind or you will notice it all day long. Plus the pool has NO STEPS, only ladders and mostly 4 1/2 ft deep thruout. Hard to get in and out. And the design, while attractive from a distance, does not lend itself to swimming any kind of lap - very scalloped and curvy. Reservation restaurants - You can only use the dinner restaurants at your resort. We did try three of the four. Each had \"sittings\" - everyone arrives for either the early 6:30 sitting or the late 8:45 sitting. This forces the kitchen to prepare all meals at the same time. So they cheat, and prepare some elements of the meals ahead. They offer a limited menu and anticipate a certain number of each item and cook them in advance. Fine for soup or cold items, but not hot hors douvers (spl) or entrees. So some items will have past their prime by the time you get them. We have had better food quality at other all inclusives that offer reservations every 15 minutes or so to stager the diners. That way each meal is prepared as ordered rather than in advance. With Riu you get what you pay for. In Playacar alone, they offer the bargain Tequila to the Palace Riviera Maya. If you can afford it, go to either Palace - Riviera Maya if possible. Maya is newer and designed around the same basic plan as Mexico, but they learned from their mistakes and made the improvements at Maya.

All rooms were clean and well equipped. No complaints at all. Beds were comfortable and maid service was thorough every day. Rooms on the Yucatan side are definitely quieter than those on the fountain side. On the fountain side you hear the noise from the outdoor band stand and theatre every night until 11 PM. The food was great. Our son is an executive chef at a well known Vancouver, BC hotel and he was impressed with the quality of the food. Breakfasts were great with a tremendous selection. Lunch can be had at the main buffet or closer to the beach in the El Patio restaurant. Suppers were good at the main buffet. We tried two of the gourmet restaurants, the Krystal and the Japanese. Both were excellent. The Krystal was our favourite. Both the filet and the salmon at the Krystal were very good. You can't go wrong with either one. The hotel is impeccibly kept. Staff are constantly cleaning and tending to the landscaping. We never had a problem finding a lounger at either the pool or the beach. The sand at the beach is amazing; soft and clean. The water was a little cool, but very refreshing after being in the hot sun. As others have said, the \"whales\" are there for a reason, they stop the beach from eroding away. Staff are regularly making the rounds on the beach offering guests cool drinks. There are some vendors who walk the beach trying to sell their wares, but a simple \"No, gracias\" and they continue on their way. The hotel is well located in the Playacar area.

This year there was approx. a fifteen minute wait for our SUV while last year we found them to be much more prompt. There was also a bit of confusion and delay upon leaving the resort at the end of our trip which held at the gates of Playacar for 50 minutes - but that was no fault of Greyline, just an overzealous taxi driver that caused some confusion - but that's another story... Upon entering the airconditioned lobby, we were greeted by Manuel, usually the first person you see when entering the RPM, with a cool drink, hug and a \"welcome home\". We went to the front desk and were welcomed back by the wonderful Luis - and found he had the room we had requested ready and waiting. Our room was beautifully decorated with flowers each day with as well as occassional gifts of food, art, etc. from management. The front desk was outgoing and wonderful, especially Luis who was so helpful, and at times, comical, and even offered to come say goodbye on his day off...this front desk is the best the RPM has ever had... The grounds were just as beautiful as in years past with improvements constantly being made. We don't spend much time in the pool area but found it a bit livelier than in years past with music which was nice to see. There is a wonderful restaurant near the beach which offers lunch as well as a great view of the beach. The more formal buffet also offers lunch as an option. Room service was always prompt - delivered within a few minutes - and always beautifully presented. Raphael, head waiter, made our stay as special as he has every other year...and as did Gebrail, the other head waiter. We were constantly asked how everything was and if we needed anything. They made sure everything was perfect and had our table set aside with flowers during our stay which was very sweet... Breakfast buffet was our favourite with so many options from fresh breads, bacon, eggs, cheeses, fruits, waffles, etc. to choose from. We have always loved the evening buffet (especially the mexican area somewhat hidden in a seperate section) and loved the incredible variety there. It was just as wonderful as in years past with many hot cooking and carving stations, ice sculptures, etc.. We did try the specialty restaurant Krystal which was absolutely amazing in both service and flavour. I wish we had taken the time to try more of the specialty restaurants. We enjoyed sitting in the lobby in the evenings and listening to the piano before dinner. Emil was waiter extaordinaire who always had a smile and your drink ready before you were even finished your last. Our glasses were never empty. anywhere at RPM..We enjoyed coffee in the courtyard which was beautifully light after dinner. We never did watch the evening shows as they were nice to see, but somewhat the same as in years past. We found the beach much larger than last year, with some of the necessary remaining sandwhales still showing. There was so much room on the beach this year, either shaded with palm trees or not...near the water or quieter back in the hammocks...so many options to choose from...it was never crowded. The RPM truly has the best beach of all the Rius in Playa. We loved to walk past the Riu Yucatan and the remaining hotels to the undeveloped beach area about five to ten minutes away, it is quite lovely and untouched. We also loved our walks to Playa which usually took about twenty minutes there and a $5 cab ride back. There were nice updates to the safes (using keypads instead of actual keys), new LCD screen TVs and new beds which were very comfortable to sleep in, not hard at all as in years past. Unfortunately, the beds are still two doubles pushed together as oppossed to a true King bed. Housekeeping service was outstanding this year, very clean, very efficiient. The only problem I had was if I threw out a bottle of lotion not completely empty, the housekeeper, thinking it was a mistake, would pull it out of the trash, and place it on the counter. There was constant flowers, towel and curtain art in our room each day. We did have lunch at RPRM a couple of times - it is a beautiful resort. It did seem to have a lot more activity and was a bit louder than what we were looking for during our stay. It just seems that at the RPM there is always someplace to escape to for quiet, be it the beach, the pool, lobby, etc. The hotel was pretty quiet the first part of our stay and reached full capactiy the last few days, but there was always plenty of room everywhere. We definately were happy with our choice of Rius. The grounds were gorgeous, the food wonderful, the atmosphere peaceful - but it is the amazing service and staff that make it so unique and it will always definately be our 'home' in Mexico.

Note we have stayed at Royal Solaris and Barcelo Maya in Mexico and Couples, Sandels, Breezes and Grand Lido Braco in Jamaica. If you have never stayed at an all inclusive you will really enjoy Riu Palace. I am always looking for a deal and out of Detroit it cost us $3,000 for the week which I consider a very good price. The up side to the resort is the sandy beach, the beautiful complex and their employees which are the nicest of any resort I have visited. The meals overall are good with the Krystal restaurant being the best and I would guess that dinner would cost $150 plus in the mid-west . The location is excellent and my wife felt safe leaving the complex and walking daily to town and back. I enjoyed running into town with no problems. Now the down side to our visit. I enjoy wine and the Chilean wine they offered was good if you could get it. The wines from Mexico were not very drinkable but the champagne was ok. I ended up going to Wal-mart to buy my own white wine. There is a wine shop right across the street from Wal-mart if you don't like their selection. The Steak House dinner which required reservations was a big disappointment. I would guess my steak was 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick so I wouldn't recommend this restaurant. The Brazilian restaurant was a joke. They come around with meat on long skewers and actually placed the meat on our plate cutting meat off that had just sat on someone else's plate. We had to pass on the meat an go to the main restaurant. Finally on our last night we were asleep in our room when we hear someone trying to open our door. We heard the male tell house keeping staff it was his and didn't have his key and would they let him in and sure enough they opened the door for him. I had the latch pulled so they could open the door but not get in. I contacted the front desk and was told the male trying to get in was drunk and the cleaning staff could not speak english so no problem. I will let your imagination review the different scenarios that could have taken place and I plan on following up with the director of the complex as this is an easy one to fix.

We were very satisfied that Riu delivered on these expectations. The town of Playa del Carmen was a comfortable walking distance, about one mile. Shopping (price-wise) was much better in town than in the small shopping mall in Playacar (which was conveniently located across the street from the hotel). The ride from/to the airport can take a while in a shuttle van due to other resort stops. It seemed like we drove forever... well, it's further than it looks on the map. We were impressed with the facilities, the buildings, the rooms, and the grounds. The hotel had perhaps the most attentive and friendly staff we have ever encountered. Everyone seemed willing to help and do whatever they could to make us comfortable. I would definitely recommend this resort. We did not venture to the other Riu properties that were nearby. (I understand the \"nightlife\" extended into the early morning at the other properties, but we were often too tired to stay up.) The food in the buffet and specialty restaurants was very good. In some ways, it felt like we were on a cruise ship. Maybe this was because of the cash-less, all-inclusive nature of the resort. The entertainment at the hotel was less than first rate, and kind of hokey at times, but enthusiastic and we still enjoyed it. Most of the live bands were pretty good. I have to say I was a bit apprehensive about going to Mexico, mostly because of the water situation. But bottled water was available throughout the resort (and other places), everyone seemed to use purified ice, and we were careful. If I can make any suggestion of improvement, it would be regarding RIU restaurant reservations. You can only make same-day reservations. It was hard to make reservations for the restaurants (especially the most popular Krystal) unless you woke up very early (7:30am) and waited in line; you first got a line number, then you could sit and relax until they took reservations. Sometimes the line got very long before the reservation desk opened (between 8 and 8:30am). The allocation of reservations seemed to get exhausted very quickly after the reservation desk opened. They only had two seating times for dinner. Each night we went to a restaurant (3 out of 5 nights), there were empty seats. I'm not sure if this was due to cancellation or clerical problems, or even low demand. If possible, it would be good to have a standby list that could be utilized when the restaurant opened. This would allow more guests to use the restaurants and become satisfied. I don't know why they wouldn't fill the seats even at the last minute. With empty seats, they still turned people away (without reservations) at the door at each seating. Go to the Xcaret eco-park for one day; we had a great time there on Saturday. It is less crowded FRI-thru-MON than TUE-thru-THU, probably due to vacationers penchant to travel on weekends and take 1-2 days to get their bearings.

We found it a beautiful resort and had a fabulous time. Truly cannot understand some of the negative reviews. Staff excellent, very friendly and helpful, we never wanted for anything. Most went that step further to make your stay more enjoyable. We had a couple of instances with our room maid, our room wasn\u2019t serviced on the first day and three times the first week we had to chase housekeeping for toilet paper as she hadn\u2019t left a spare roll, but hey, nowhere is 100% perfect. The buffet restaurant was very good, plenty of choice, I gained 8 pounds in 2weeks! Breakfast was amazing never seen such a choice in any other hotel before. There was something for everyone, whatever your nationality. We didn\u2019t try any of the speciality restaurants as the sittings were either too early or too late plus didn\u2019t fancy getting up that early on holiday to make the reservations!! Anyway we were quite happy with the buffet. Rooms were lovely and spacious, no musty smell. The new mattresses were firm but comfortable. E-mailed hotel 2 wks prior to going, requesting room on the Yucatan side (as after reading reviews had learnt it was the quieter side) but hinted a fountain view room would be very nice if possible. Upon arriving we found we had been upgraded to fountain/courtyard view for no extra charge!! The beach was lovely, didn\u2019t find the whales a problem, you just have to accept they\u2019ve got to be there. Plenty of loungers available any time of day with numerous quiet sections under the palm trees. Pool area was good, also plenty of loungers available. Water a bit cold though! It had a quiet side and a noisy side depending what you preferred. Slight musty smell sometimes in lobby and one end of restaurant but only if the temperature dropped or if it had been raining so obviously due to the tropical atmosphere. Ladies, if you\u2019re thinking of bringing your own hairdryer, there is a power point under the mirror in the bedroom. It was one of my petty concerns before going as I hate drying my hair in a steamed up bathroom !! So to sum it all up, the Place Mexico is a beautiful hotel, though not recommended for families and teenagers. We chose the hotel for this reason as we have done the \u201cfamily holidays thing\u201d and now we leave the kids behind! I think there were only about 6 children staying whilst we were there. Bliss! We went for a drink to the other Ruis and if budget doesn\u2019t stretch to one of the Palaces then the Yucatan would be our second choice. Would we recommend the Place Mexico?

I don't believe you'll be disappointed with the hotel or its amenities should it be your choice. Is it for everyone? Perhaps not. If you're a young single looking for a go-go atmosphere this resort might not be your first choice. However, for those looking for a quality resort in a great location with well above average \"all inclusive\" food, beverage and entertainment The RIU Palace Riviera Maya presents an excellent choice. The hotel is very pleasing both visually and in its quality of service and amenities. The people working at this resort are pleasant, courteous and truly seem to care about the hotel's guests. The hotel's location in Playacar is excellent. Playacar is a gated community just south of Playa del Carmen. It contains a number of resorts, condominiums, single homes and commercial areas. There is a shopping plaza several blocks south of the hotel. The town of Playa del Carmen is about one and a half miles north of the hotel and is a relatively easy walk. Along the way are several Mayan architectural sites. For those who would rather ride into town the fare from the hotel is 50 pesos or $ 5.00 USD. Playa del Carmen itself is certainly worth going into. There are multitudes of shops, restaurants and boutique hotels. Fifth Avenue is a pedestrian only street and is worth strolling. In the evening many restaurants and bars have mariachi bands, folk singers and rock bands many of which may be enjoyed from the street. Playa del Carmen also has several large department style stores including a Wal*Mart. The standard junior suites at RIU Palace Riviera Maya are designed in split level fashion. Upon entry into the room are the bathroom, sleeping and closet areas. Several steps down from the entry level is a sitting area and balcony. The sitting area has a sofa, cocktail table and clothes storage bureau. The room's television is located on the bureau in the sitting area. It can be difficult to watch the television from bed as it does not swivel toward the sleeping area. The bathroom in the room is quite large and has double sinks and a Jacuzzi tub with shower. One caveat in the bathroom. Because the Jacuzzi tub is quite deep there is about a 26 inch rise to step over in order to access the tub/shower. There are assist bars in several places to aid entry and exit. Food is always important at an all-inclusive resort. The food, service and dining venues at the Palace Riviera Maya range from good to excellent. Breakfast which is available from 7:30 AM to 10:30 AM is at the Don Manuel buffet which features a wide variety of choices to suit both North American and European appetites. This restaurant which also serves buffet lunch and dinner selections has both indoor and outdoor seating areas. The outdoor seating area overlooks the hotel's central plaza, gardens and fountains. Specialty restaurant options include a steak house, japanese, mexican, brazilian and fusion venues. With the exception of the steak house all of the specialty restaurants are relatively small in size and are very nicely decorated to match each specialty theme. The steak house is transformed in the evening from a poolside buffet. This buffet serves lunch from noon to about 4:00 PM. and has both hot and cold selections. To summarize this review; if you're looking for a well designed, well run resort with above average amenities, food and services the RIU Palace Riviera Maya warrants your attention.", "Date": "February 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "toronto", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!!\u201d", "Author": "bobdonna", "ReviewID": "UR24351915", "Content": "We have been reading up on the hotel for the last month and there was a lot of negative comments.

The resort wasn't the most spectacular place I've stayed in the Cancun area but it was perfect for a few days to relax and have fun with friends. PROS: 1. When you stay here you can use any of the Riu resorts in the area - I think there were 5-6 within walking distance. We were happy that there was a night club across the street at the Riu Tequila, so we could go for a little while and not have to worry about cabbing it back to the resort late at night. We also enjoyed the pool at one of the other Riu Palaces and the bartender brought us shots to help us celebrate our friend's birthday without us even asking - thanks Gerardo!!! 2. The minibar and alcohol provided in the rooms is fully stocked - lots of bottled water - both regular sized and large bottles which were perfect for taking in our beach bags to the beach! We also ran into the gentleman who filled up the minibar everyday and he would always let us take extra water and asked if there was any type of alcohol or pop we would like more of in our room. 3. The hotel is beautiful looking and the grounds are very nice, with lots of chairs at both the beach and pools. 4. The food was okay - we only went to the Japanese restaurant and the buffet and always found things we liked at every meal. Great guacamole and chips!!! Some of the options we steered clear of but for the most part we weren't expecting a gourmet dining experience, so we were fine with what was offered. 5. The staff was very friendly and helpful - we saw a lot of the bartenders on multiple days and they asked if we wanted our regular drinks. Make sure to ask for premium alcohol when you order drinks! A big thank you Elena at the lobby bar!! CONS: 1. There was the odd spot where there would be a strong sewage smell but it is Mexico, so you almost have to just accept it! 2. The coffee was very strong and not very tasty but there is a Starbucks right across the street, so for us it wasn't a big deal to spend a few bucks each day there rather than miss our morning cup of joe. The staff at the Starbucks were super friendly too and pretty much knew our orders by the time we left! 3.

There were small mosquitoes that flew around (one or two a night) but they do not bother you. We did not have any issues with \"lost or stolen\" items as other reviewers mentioned. We always locked our valuables in the safe. Our room was on the first floor and facing the hotel next door. We even brought our camera to the pool and beach but never had anything stolen. The service at this hotel is outstanding - you are waited on hand and foot. You can eat at either the buffet or the specialty restaurants each evening. The reservation system for the specialty restaurants leaves a little bit to be desired. You must wait at the lounge between 8 and 8:30am for someone to distribute numbers and then you are called to make your selection. We did not have difficulty getting into any restaurant. Our favorite was the Krystal which we sent to twice. Men must wear long slacks to all restaurants. The pool area is quiet, although there is a major issue with the reserving of chairs with towels. We always had a place but I would see towels on chairs not occupied until 12 noon -- a bit unfair to those who actually want to relax before then. It is nice to lounge at the pool -- the side opposite the pool bar is nice and quiet. The drink service is prompt and frequent - always someone around to serve you. We walked to several of the other Riu hotels nearby which are certainly a more casual atmosphere than this hotel. It all depends on what you are looking for. We especially enjoyed sitting on the terrace in the evening and listening to the band and watching others dance while we were waited on hand and foot -- a true, relaxing vacation!", "Date": "January 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Syracuse, NY", "Title": "\u201cWeren't impressed\u201d", "Author": "JK315", "ReviewID": "UR23345546", "Content": "We got an upgrade from Riu Tequila to stay here for 3 days. We were told this was their best property so figured we'd take the upgrade. The lobby was nice, however it had a horrible musty/stale cigarette odor that never went away. After checking in they instructed us to the elevator and said our bags would arrive to our room shorty thereafter. When we got in the elevator I commented on how hot it was in there. All the sudden the elevator got stuck! We tried pressing the buttons to open and NOTHING! I panicked because litterally we were sweltering of heat! My husband had to pry the doors open and thank god it was on a floor. We notified the front desk and didn't use the elevator again til we checked out. As we waited for it to come down, there were 4 people stuck in it! So we hauled our luggage up the stairs and wouldn't use it! The grounds were very nice and well maintained. The pool was smaller than the other resorts. Much smaller. Oddly it didn't have shallow ends! At the other resorts everytime you ran into an employee they always said \"hola\" and had a welcoming smile. NOT HERE! The atmosphere was very unwelcoming. The food selection wasn't nearly as big nor as good as Tequila. Our room was 00030 on the bottom level. Warning: if you have a room on the bottom level this side you have a view of a fence where the walk way is to the beach from the other resorts. So basically if you were in your room you had to keep the curtains shut or everyone could see directly in your room! The only thing we liked about this resort was we actually got towel art in our room and the beach was beautiful. However when we were at Tequila, we had access to Riu Yucatan and Riu Playacar that was on the beach. The sand bags in the ocean were unsightly but they did block the big waves so you could swim! Overall, if we had paid to stay here I would have been upset! I really wish we didn't take the upgrade and spent our last few days at Tequila. It was much more fun there. I read a review on here from one woman that stated they would have had more fun at a funeral parlor then staying here, she was right! Save your money and book Riu Tequila!

As a direct result of a hotel air conditioning repairman failing to latch a first-floor patio door, my son's room was broken into. Probably due to being frightened while going through his backpack (which was dumped unceremoniously on the bed), the thief left with only the backpack and what he thought was a wallet. When we discovered the theft, my son's driver's license, which was the only thing in the wallet, was on the patio floor. We contacted hotel security and then went to the front desk to make our report. The General Manager of the hotel, a woman who's name I have but I need not share here, informed us that there was nothing she could do, as RIU policy prevented her from making good on the theft. I suggested that all she need do was credit my bill with the cost of the empty backpack (US$200) and, if it was found later, merely reverse the credit (the vacation, for 7 of us, had already cost US$20,000 with airfare and transfers.) She refused and said that all I could do was file a police report. She would do nothing. Her attitude was the classic \"You'll be gone in a day or two and I could care less what happens to you, your backpack or your family.\" She then informed me that the wallet had been found, ,empty (it was empty when it started, except for the license) in an area surrounded by three used condoms. Used condoms! How lady-like! Did she mean for me to believe that my son had left his backpack somewhere on her grounds after a rather robust night of sexual activity? That would have been impossible, as he slept in our room that night. He forgot his room key and the night staff at the front desk, without ever asking to see any identification, had given him the room key to someone else's room! He couldn't have slept in his own room that night if he wanted to. His room key was on the night table right where he left it the next morning when we discovered the theft. The \"condom\" line had been done solely to embarass my son in my eyes. It did not. I then contacted the Mexican State Police and waited three hours until they responded. When the General Manager saw the police at the curb, she promptly sent a messenger to the lobby to offer me, perhaps, a one-room upgrade (we had three for the family.) I told her no, I didn't want her single room upgrade, especially after killing a morning of my vacation. So this General Manager of a major chain allowed two uniformed Mexican State Police motorcycle cops with submachine guns strapped across their chests to interview me in her own main lobby! Then, when it became apparent that I was serious, a Captain of the State Police arrived in an armored vehicle with an anti-aircraft gun on the back, drove to the front door of the hotel, parked it there and came into the lobby to invite me to make my complaint with the Bilingual Minister of Justice of the Mexican Federal Police in Playa del Carmen. I did make this report, where I discovered that the logbook showed that the RIU chain in Playa del Carmen (though not this hotel unit) had its fair share of criminal complaints. Wonder of wonders, the backpack showed up the next day, having been \"found\" at the pool. The General Manager, who had turned her front lobby into an armed camp, never had the courtesy to present it to me herself, but had a lackey do it. My e-mails to RIU's Vice President in Los Cabos went unanswered and my copy to RIU's Customer Service produced the classic \"we're investigating\" response. The moral of the story is that there is something to be said for hotels bearing an American hotel chain name. We teach hospitality in our colleges and that principle is based on our belief that the smallest mistake is an opportunity to make a guest for life. Obviously, the huge RIU chain, which is heavily used by Europeans, gets away with having its luxury hotel units run by minor functionaries who do not have the autonomy to solve the sort of problems handled by American motel managers everyday. Perhaps, in this failing economy, we should get smarter with our vacation dollars. The world is learning a valuable lesson right now. Without America, there is no global economy. My experience at the RIU Palace Mexico suggests that not everyone has learned that lesson as yet. By the way, the hotel is very lovely and the food (all inclusive) about at the level of a mid-level cruise line. The beach is the reason to go as it is far superior to any other RIU in the area.", "Date": "January 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "timetrvl", "Title": "\u201cqualified okay place....\u201d", "Author": "timetrvl", "ReviewID": "UR23233039", "Content": "Booked this hotel through a tour operator. We stayed at a sister Riu last year (playa del carmen). Riu is the equivalent of Starbucks of the hotels in the Cancun area. They have about 8 \"palaces\". Last year's experience was good, so we tried a different PALACE. It is identical in many ways to the bigger (and better) Palace (playa del carmen). Check-in service was relatively quick and the rooms were spacious and clean. You do need a flashlight in the shower tub as the Riu infamously keeps you in the dark in the shower area. Amenities of the property overall were good. The beach is very nice and clean with abundant chairs. Unfortunately those gigantic sand bags to stop beach erosion are quite unsightly, but necessary. The palm trees give the natural shade for those who prefer it without seeing the ugly colors of cheap and faded umbrellas. Beach bars were close and you could get service while lounging. The Pool was very disappointing. I was expecting to see the signature \"palace pool\" but the layout cuts the pool in half or quarters, and the look of concrete was inconsistent with the nice center fountains and landscape that dots the way to the beach and pool area. The pool looked like it was 4 small pools with no rhyme or reason. There was the obligatory swim up bar and an awkwardly placed volleyball net in the middle near the swim up bar! If you are planning to go to the gym to work out, forget it. It is by far the most disappointing amenity. It is a room of about 15x15 with no view and a multitude of third rate and broken pieces of equipment. When I walked in, two 8-year old boys completely wet from the pool and with no shoes were using the equipment while their mom was non-chalantly using the only operational treadmill and completely oblivious to the kids endangering themselves. There were no towels, no cups, and an empty water cooler. There was sand on the floor. Food is okay if you are a big fan of \"sumptuous buffets\". After a day of that, you're ready for change. Breakfast is definitely the best part. Employees in general had a good attitude and worked very hard. They were accommodating and courteous. Making dinner reservations for the small restaurants was difficult and you could see that they preferred that you go to the buffet as you have to make reservations between 8-1030AM. One day I was there at 9AM only to learn that the Japanese restaurant was \"fully booked\". I peaked in to see that the late seating still had open tables, but they refused to seat us because we did not have reservations!!! As in the other Riu, this hotel is acoustically challenged. There was not one quiet spot in the whole resort. The walls are thin, and the cleaning crew carry real loud conversations in the hallways at 7AM! The tile is ribbed, so anything that rolls on it makes a lot of noise. If you escape to the pool for peace and quiet, you will be greeted with screaming kids, volleyball games, or even bingo. At the beach, your peace and quiet on the hammock is immediately ruined by beach volleyball, horseshoe contests or vendors hawking their ware. This resort is not for everybody. If you go with low expectations, you will be happy.

We booked about 6 weeks ago with Thomson holidays in the UK and got an excellent price for a fortnight all inlcusive. The location of the hotel is perfect, directly on a lovely stretch of beach, close to a number of other Riu hotels (all of which you are able to use) and a 20 minute or 50 peso cab ride into PDC. The public areas of the hotel and the gardens, are very good, although as some of the other reviewers have mentioned there is an unpleasant musty odour in places. We had a standard room on the top floor facing the garden (rather than the courtyard). Our room got no sun all day so was rather dark and a bit dinghy as a result. On the positive side the rooms are large and have all the amenities you could reasonably expect - including a free and constantly refilled mini bar. The furnishings in the room and the bathroom were a little tired and could do with updating but certainly adequate. There were two smallish doubles rather than one big king bed which was not great, beds were also very hard - didnt bother us too much but some might find them uncomfortable. We also found the room to have a constant musty odour - again this is reported in a number of other reviews and i'm not sure why the hotel cant do something about it. They put it down to the humidity and temperature but other places with similar climates dont seem to suffer in the same way? The variety of food available was excellent, I can't imagine anyone would ever find themselves going hungry. However, I couldnt really understand the previous rave reviews for the food. It was adequate but certainly not gourmet! We tried 3 of the speciality restuarants. The steak house was ok, we didnt like the brazilian at all and the fusion restuarant Kystral was the best but nothing to write home about and certainly not worth getting up at the crack of dawn to secure a table! 'The buffet had lots and lots of variety but the food was really only like good quality 'canteen' food rather than what you would consider a nice meal out. Another issue we had with the food from the buffets (both at lunch and in the evening) was that it was often not particularly hot. I dont want to give the impression that the food was poor because it wasnt but if you are a foodie or if you like eating out at good quality restuarants then you will be disappointed in what is served. Drinks service was excellent and we were never kept waiting for longer than a couple of minutes for service whether in any of the bars, round the pool or even on the beach. The staff at the hotel were all exceptionally friendly and enthusiastic - and it didnt seem to make a difference whether you were tipping or not. I think the hotel staff are a definite strong point. All in all we thought the hotel represented excellent value for money, enjoyed our stay and wouldnt hesitate to go there again. However if you are expecting luxury you might be disappointed. The 'five star' rating given in some brochures is misleading. This is not a hotel of five star quality, maybe more like a good european 3 or average 4 star - but to be fair the price you are paying should tell you what you are getting.

We travel extensively and stay in all sorts of resorts, from budget to high end. We must say that this resort is near the top of our list. We don't quite understand the negative reviews posted previously. The resort, grounds, staff, food, beach, all are exceptional. Perhaps the unattractive sand bags scattered along the beach could go, which they will once the beach is brought back. More detailed feedback is below: Resort and grounds- very colonial and paladian. The nicest architechture of all 5 Rius in the area (including Riu Palace Riviera Maya). The grounds are beautiful and the gardens well kept. There are people working round the clock perfecting the resort. Rooms-all rooms face the gardens so no oceanviews, unless you book one of the suites on the top floors facing the pool (they perhaps offer some partial oceanviews). The rooms are kept clean at all times. Inviting furnishing and decoration in the room. Flat screet TVs. Stocked fridge replenished daily. The mattress seemed to be brand new and on the harder side. Beach area-very tropical with tons of palm trees. Very wide. Best beach area out of all 5 Rius or other resort (we checked them all). Plenty of empty chairs in the shade or sun. Beach bar someone small but we never really used it. The beach service was great. They come to you with the tray full of drinks or you can order and they'll bring you what you want. The area in front of this Riu is best for swimming in the area and you are close to the underdeveloped part with no hotels or sand bags in the water (to the right of the resort, past Sandos Playacar). You can do your daily walks here and can walk for 1/2 hour or so until you reach the \"end\" where you can do some good snorkling. Food and restaurants-the best buffet restaurant is Don Julian for all three meals. The other two by the beach are OK for a quick snack, but do not offer as good of a choice as Don Julian. Be aware, lunch is served only inside of Don Julian. The reservations for a la carte restaurants are taken from 8:30 AM not in the afternoon as the previous poster mentioned (this is perhaps the reason why he never got the reservation). We lined up three times and got what we wanted. Be there at 8:20-8:30, grab the number and wait. It takes no longer than 10 minutes. We ate twice at Krystal, the fusion restaurant, which we highly recommend. We heard the Steakhouse was great and it seemed to fill in fast (we did not eat there). We tried the Brasilien which was OK. Overall, food was great and plentiful. Entertainment-just OK. Some nights were better than the others. Live bands, dancing, all your regular stuff you get at any all inclusive resort. This resort seemed to be a bit quiter that the other Rius so this is a plus if this is what you want. You can always go to any of the other Rius for louder atmosphere. Guests-mostly older, some young families with very small kids and some couples. Guests from Germany, Italy, US and Canada. We would stay here again.

It has been our experience in the past that some of the best prices occur the end of October -early November. We have stayed at two RIU's previously ( Negril and Cabo San Lucas). This hotel had very good ratings on trip advisor. I should mention that there are 4 other RIU's within walking distance of this RIU. We enjoyed walking to the other RIU's to have a drink or lunch. Pros- Great beach- It was the best swimming beach due to the artificial coral reefs . The whole beach was very sandy and we never felt any coral underneath. The beach area is hugh with lots of shade , real Palm trees and the most lounge chairs I have ever seen in one location. Rooms were in good shape and everything worked. There are no ocean view or ocean side rooms. You only get to look at the Garden or trees along the fence . Location - was great - Playacar is only 1 1/2 miles from Playa del Carmen. Staff - All the staff was very friendly and helpful. It does help to tip the staff especially the maids. Con's Food - was mediocre. Buffet was better then average but 3 of the 4 dinner places were mediocre at best. Breakfast and lunch were very good but only the Gourmet restaurant was excellent. Room upgrade- This was the first time we were not able to upgrade our room to a more favorable view. Even though the Palace Mexico was only 1/4 full and no one was staying in those rooms - the management would not budge. In the past we would give a good tip to the front desk and they would take care of our room. We were able to get a room with a different balcony but still facing the fence side. Turns out they want you to apply for a RIU card and the more times you stay the better chance you have to upgrade. Sounds like a Comfort Inn to me. We noticed a strange odor in the main lobby, bar area and protected hallways. Most lobby's are open and this one is enclosed- even the newer RIU Rivera Maya had the same odor due to being enclosed. The hall ways must have some type of mold causing the unpleasant odor. We were the only ones that seemed to be aware of this- it was the first resort we've stayed in that was not open. There were a lot more people staying at the other RIU\"s- if you like no crowds this was the place to stay. It was very quiet and somewhat boring at times so we went to the other's for fun.

You select the hotel rating and Funjet selects the hotel. You don't learn about which hotel until about a week ahead of time. Kind of a surprise. We picked a \"5 star\" property and ended up at Riu Mexico. The property is beautiful. Our travel agent mistakenly beleived we were staying at the Riu Riviera Maya which is only 5 properties away. We looked at both and the Riu Mexico has a more ambience. The architecture is more interesting and the beach is significantly larger. The pool area; however, is showing it's age (about 10 years old) and needs to be updated, especially the bar area where much of the cabinetry was visably rotted from all the moisture. Nonetheless, the bar was clean. I saw them disenfect the bar and equiptment regularly. They also disinfected the pool ladders and and showers, a nice idea. The Good: The food was overall quite good. I would compare it to good quality cruise ship food, maybe a litte better, but certainly not gourmet. There was a lot of variety for each meal and the main restaurant has a nice outdoor seating area, but it's hard to get a table outside unless you get there real early. The grounds and property are immacuately maintained and quite lush and beautiful. We were very impressed. The rooms are large and very clean. The bathrooms are large, but could use updating. This place has a large white sand beach with an even larger area that is covered with by palm trees, nice for relaxing in the shade. There is a beach bar. We found bar service on the beach to be almost nonexistant, but the service by the pool was great. As I mentioned earlier, the pool could use updating, but it is still very nice. There are plenty of chairs both at the pool and at the beach. We didn't find a problem with people saving chairs as there was no need. The Not So Good: As others have mentioned on this website, the beds are very hard and uncomfortable. I emailed the hotel ahead of time and request foam mattress pads. I received a reply indicated that this would be taken care of-it was NOT. I complained 4 times and each time except the last I was told it would be rectified. The last time I went personally to the front desk where I was told \"the mattresses are all new and we no longer have any mattress pads\" When I mentioned the email and told him I had personally seen maids bring the pads to other rooms he became quite rude. At that point I gave up on the pads. The other big problem is the \"upscale\" restaurant reservation system. There are 4 non-buffet restaurants on site which are open only for dinner. In order to get a reservation you have to go the theatre at about 8 am. An employee comes in and hands out numbers which requires you to hold up your hand like school child and indicate the order in which you arrived. You then get to meet with the restaurant represenative and get your reservation slip. Interestingly, I never saw more than 25 people show up at the theatre, yet all the restaurants are full for the both the 6:30 pm and 8:45 pm seatings. Clearly, there is an alternate \"reservation\" system. I found this process degrading and it needs to be changed.

Last time was 5 yrs ago at the Riu Tequila. The palace is built to impress and it certainly does this. I agree with the positive reviews. It definitely has the best beach and a large sitting area between the pool and beach. Yes, the sand bags are ugly, but they had no choice. Unfortunately, the best beach is located to the right of the Sandos resort. Thats what the beach in front of the Palace used to look like. Still were able to enjoy the waves, water was warm. Service was excellent as was the food. Very varied to please all. Internet was available at the piano bar for 3 us for 15 minutes. If you sign up for the Riu class card at front desk, they double the minutes. At the Riu Playacar close by, they gave 40 minutes with the card. Internet was pretty fast. We enjoyed the location to the town and a small shopping plaza almost across from the hotel. You could buy a calling card for 10 dollars and get over 50 minutes to call Canada from one of the phones in the plaza. We walked to 5th avenue and enjoyed walking the street at night. Very safe and looked beautiful all lit up. Many fast food restaurants to be found. Also went to WalMart. Only a couple of blocks from 5th going up 10 th avenue. They have the best prices on liquor and chocolates. Better then duty free. Only problem is they would need to be put in checked luggage, possible weight issue with luggage at airport. Checked out RPRM. Also very impressive. Found the beach restaurant had more variety and was larger. The pool area was also very modern. The resort seemed more compact while the RPM was spread out more. Which to chooose? A beach person would love the RPM, while a pool person would like RPRM. We chose RPM since we able to get it for 1000 taxes in for the week of Oct 26- Nov2. This week was mainly sun. Best view would be a chair around the pool at the Riu Yucatan.

We researched this to excrutiating lengths as you'd expect but somewhere along the line somebody somewhere forgot to tell the hotel it was our honeymoon!! Which detracted slightly from what is a fabulous hotel. It took us a few days to sort out the \"honeymoon\" issue, but between Emma (Thompson Rep) and the customer services manager it was all resolved. Ok......the hotel; ROOM We were upgraded to a garden view room which had a great aspect. The room itself was on two levels; the top level contained the two enourmous double beds and the lower level was the sitting room area (all open plan). In the room was plenty of storage, safety deposit box (included), 4 optics with branded spirits (all inclusive) and a minifridge restocked daily filled with mineral water (large and small), Corona and branded soft drinks. Make sure you keep the mozzy net doors closed because we got bitten quite a lot!! WEATHER We went between 28th Aug and 11th Sept. It was generally hot (90 +) and very humid. We found that the breeze from the beach was a welcome break every now and then from the sweaty, sticky heat of the pool. Whilst there hurricane Gustav, Hannah and Ike all hit Cuba and even though (thankfully) none hit or area we found that 2 days after hitting Cuba we had a day of bad weather ranging from all day cloud to 2 or 3 torrential downpours a day. It may be pertinent to note that my brother stayed at the same hotel in the first 2 weeks of August and the weather was fantastic throughout. The locals will tell you they are \"not safe\" until November arrives but if you don't mind the odd day off from the sun it should be fine. HOTEL The hotel has a buffet style main restaurant and 4 themed restaurants (Steakhouse, Argentinian. Japenese and the Fusion). The buffet was more than adequate and we went to all but the Fusion (which I was told on the last day was probably the best). We found that the buffet themed nights encompassed most of the food from the A la Carte restaurants and can say that the choice every exceeded my expectations. There are four other RIU hotels within walking distance where your A.I wristband is also welcome. We had a nose around and can honestly say that pound for pound the PALCE MEXICO was the best.

If you need info in The RPRM , please see my review . this review will only pertain to RPM. Check -in was a breeze and a drink is handed to you right on the spot . Our room was a upgraded room , the Honeymoon Suite I believe. It was outstanding !! Very spacious and with a gorgeous Ocean view . Our Balcony was HUGE !! We had nice big white fluffy terry cloth robes . Every night for turn down service our maid left us chocolates ....( we left tips of $1 or $2 every day ) Some of my guests complained of the musty smell in their room , but I always bring a travel candle with me , and plus anyone who has travelled enough KNOWS that when you stay at a BEACH front property , there is bound to be some type of \" Musty smell \" ..it 100 degrees every day and night , what do you expect . Go with an open mind and if smells bother you that much then bring a travel candle and be sure to use it . Food , well I will sum it up to this ....my parents arrived a few days before my husband to be and I . I asked her if she had booked any of her a'la cartes , because the restaurants are always a fun treat . Her reply to me was as follows \" Sweetie, if you can't find what you are looking for at the nightly buffet , then just stay home \" ....she was right . The buffets always had something for everyone . The breakfasts were outstanding and the dinners were a different theme each night , including a Sushi station !! YOU will def. not starve . But if you can book your alacartes , do so . All of them are great , especially the Brazillian and the Gourmet one . Pool- has a swim up bar and a quiet side , but we spent most of our time at the beach . If you don't like the beach and are more of a pool person then just wander to any one of the other Riu's ...specifically the Riu Palace Riviera Maya , has an outstanding pool ! Complete with beds, tables and jacuzzis , ALL inside the pool . Beach - awesome , lots of room , lots of chairs , and full drink and waiter service , they will come directly to you and offer to take your order . It was bliss ! There is sandwhales , but you have to understand their need to prevent any further beach erosion . Plus the sandwhales make it easier for children to play in the water safely and cuts down the waves quite a bit . Don't worry you can wander in either direction of the beach should big waves be what you seek . There is numerous activites , beach volleyball, water polo , water volley ball , surfing , parasialing , boogie boarding , name it and you can do it at the Riu Palace. Grounds, landscaping and general maintenance was outstanding . I mean these people really work hard and yet always with a smile on their face and a friendly ' Hola ' ... Make sure you venture into town . Playa del Carmen is 5 minutes away , literally hop in a cab and ask him to bring you to 5th ave. and you will be in the heart of all the shopping you could ever dream of , including some neat little restaurants and of course further down the strip is where all the night life takes place . A great bar to check out is The Blue Parrot , we went there twice it was so much fun and the cab ride is only $5 , so treat yourself to some time off the resort . There is great excursions, I recommend the Xel ha park and of course if you have never been to Mexico , you just have to go to Chtizen Itza , its a long drive away , like 2 hours or more , but so so worth it . if You can't make it to Chtizen itza then at least go see the ruins at Tulum , and bring your bathing suit , as the beach at Tulum is gorgeous . We also visted some cenotes while there , simply magical ...and also worth swimming in ; ) All all in was a wonderful trip and an amazing wedding . The wedding co-ordinators work their butts off to make you happy and they really are a great team. All of my guests had a wonderful time, they ate , they drank, they laughed , they rested ...memories were made . Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or need any advice . I am always happy to help out my fellow trip advisor members !! Pack your sunscreen , bug repellent and your smile ...you will indeed have a good time . ** Side note ** I travel quite often and ALWAYS use my in room safe , well this time around I never did , not once. I left my good necklace and diamond earrings on the bathroom counter , and they were right there when I got back to my room . My husband left his suitcase wide open ( men ! ) and inside he had cash , his Ipod and his brand new white gold bracelet , nothing happened . I also found out from my mother that my father left his entire wallet AND his passport , foolishly , on the bed ( men ! ) ..anyway , not even a single dollar was taken .

The swimming pools at each hotel are amazing and unique. The service at the pool and the restaurants is top notch. Each night there is a show with live bands and professional dancers. We danced each night! The hotel ambiance, d\u00e9cor and art have a colonial theme. You really feel like you\u2019re in a palace. The sleeping rooms are clean with modern bathrooms. The only downside is that the beds are not very comfortable. We resolved this issue by asking for mattress padding provided by the hotel. Americans prefer the other Riu Palace hotel, called Playacar.

They have live music each night under the stars. They have a really nice patio set up for dancing too. They always come by to take your drink orders so you never have to get up for a crazy drink line. Alex Peralta was the best waiter! He serves in the sushi restaurant and the main buffet for breakfast. He is a hard working friendly server so tip him well! By the way great sushi! Christian is the best water aerobics instructor (11:00am everyday) and salsa instructor, so don't miss his enthusiastic classes. He was hilarious. You won't leave his class without a huge smile!!

The bar is stocked with alcohol and mixers. Nothing top shelf. The maid service was good. I didn't have the exceptional staff service that others mentioned. I didn't feel like royalty but they were nice enough. The beach was nice with plenty of shade and lounge chairs. The water was beautiful and their beach was clean (except for the occasional cigarette butt). The drinks at the beach were watered down but you can ask for extra shots. Someone walks around with drinks on the beach so you don't have to go up to the bar. Bring plenty of bug spray because we were eaten alive on the beach by mosquitos. We had spray but didn't reapply after coming out of the ocean. The breakfast buffet was the only time we ate at the hotel. The food was ok too. I did enjoy the mimosas though! This is the first All Inclusive we've tried and I don't think we'll do it again. It's good for the drinks and the breakfast but for dinner I think we like to have more variety and more of a high end experience when we are on vacation.

This hotel is rated a 5 but would suggest it should probably be a 4--only because of the pool facilities--showing its age. The food was very good--main buffet had many selections each day. For those people who said the food was inedible--you probably don't even know what a skillet looks like! As you have probably read, you must make your reservations from 8:30 to 10:30 each day--you should probably be there by 8:00 to get your number. They move them along rapidly once it becomes 8:30. We did Sir Edwards one evening--it was very good and the service was outstanding. There are only two times a person may eat at the speciality restaurants--6:30 and 8:30. We do this when cruising but prefer to select our own time to eat when at an all-inclusive; therefore, the buffet was our main evening dining location. The first evening the service was poor, we needed to ask for water, coffee, etc. However, every other night we had one waiter and bus boy who serviced one particular section of the restaurant, so we had good service. Men--you MUST wear long pants at ALL evening meals--EVEN THE BUFFET. We saw a man turned away due to shorts-they do enforce it. The women wear whatever. The pool is small and starting to show its age. The drinks were fine. If you wanted top shelf at the pool, all you needed to do is ask. Also, a few bucks each day helps you receive what you want and also helps their workers. Remember that you are at a resort--not your local bar--and act accordingly. The lounge chairs become very hot in the afternoon and the towels don't reach from the top to the bottom. Take along an old t-shirt (xlarge) and fit it on the bottom of the lounge pad. It saves your legs from being scorched and then just leave the shirt when your vacation is over. About the pool, if you enjoy sitting around the pool, just go to the Riu Palace Riviera Maya for the day or days. Since you are at a Riu Princess you have access to all the Riu's in the area. The Riviera Maya pool(s) are much nicer, and if you like to be entertained, their staff is always having activities during the day at the pool. It is about a 10 - 15 minute walk or a $5 cab ride one way. The beach at the Mexico is very nice. Lots of chairs--many in the sun and lots in the shade. The one thing--there is no sidewalk going to the beach so it is hard to get there if you have trouble walking. We have been to some resorts that have sidewalks above the sand which makes it easier to navigate. If a person has trouble with stairs (I'm starting to encounter knee problems) you may wish to consider another resort besides the Riu. There is an elevator but we could not get it to work--besides it was at the front of the resort. To get from the lobby to the main area of the resort, you must climb stairs--this also true at the Riviera Maya. Our room was clean, the air worked, and the fan certainly circulated the air. I found that when I wanted some particular soda in the refrig I'd leave the note on top of the refrig but left a dollar or two in the refrigerator. Then the maid did not take that as her tip besides the one I left for her. Overall, we had a great time. However, we certainly would not say that we would only go back to a RIU. There are many that we have been to that are comparable to this one. However, if you have booked this hotel--don't worry, you'll have a great time if you don't sit around and nit pick all the little things.

They have plenty of loungers to lay in on the beach as well as at the pool. The rooms are really nice with plenty of room, and the bathroom has a bidet. Maid service was execellent and our mini-bar/fridge was filled daily. Food was great - they have 4 speciality restraunts & the buffet. Our favorite was the Sir Edwards which I thought was the nicer one but all were great. The Japanese even had sake. To make sure you get a reservation for the fine dining you really need to get with the lady that does the reservations about 8 a.m. & get a number & then at 8:30 she will start signing up in the numerical order. I thought the drinks were good & plenty strong but if you wanted more alcohol in them all you had to do was ask. There is a little shopping area that is just a 5 min. walk from the resort. It has all kinds of souvenirs & a couple of pharmacies & mini-marts. There are 5 Riu hotels all within walking distance of each other. If you are a guest at one then you can visit them all, which we did for a day but we really liked ours the best. We met lots of great people & just had a blast.

We arrived to cold drinks and a beautiful room with a balcony that faced the beach area. Fresh clean linens on the bed, room was spotless, and I am a complete clean freak.. I literally was making myself sick over my decision before we arrived based on some of these reviews... There are very few (what I consider to be) downsides.. This is not an opened air hotel. It is closed, but it was very hot in the lobby area and in the bathrooms and the resturants. Now we went down the block to the Riu Palace Riviera Maya and the lobby there was nice and cold. So I must assume that the air conditioning in the Palace Mexico was not working that well, but our room was always nice and cold.. The liquor was watered down. Just ask for doubles and you will be ok. Or just drink the beer.. It is a 5 minute, 5$ cab ride to downtown Playa. Must see 5th Ave and that area. Just stunning.. Go snorkling in Akumal Bay. BEAUTIFUL... If I had to compare the Palace Mexico to the Palace Riviera Maya, I would say that the Palace Mexico's beach was much better than the newer Palace Riviera Maya. But the pool at the Riviera Maya was hands down better then the Palace Mexico.. Great beach service at both... We chose the Riu Palace Mexico over all of the Riu's in the area as it is on the quiter side, but loved that if we wanted to have a wild evening, we could utilize the other Riu's services..

Sooo glad I stuck with my original choice, cant beleive I even considered changing. It was wonderful. There were some specific concerns so I thought I would address those as that may be helpful to others trying to decide. Beach - we thought it was lovely. never had a problem getting a bed although more choice of beds with shade the earlier you go. this was definately the nicest part of the beach from what we saw when we walked along the beach and the water is the most gorgeous turquoise. Whales did not really detract and were great fun to jump off. Pool - this was a really good size and never seemed crowded. we stayed over the opposite side from the pool bar as this was quieter. never had a problem getting a bed no matter what time we arrived at the pool Food - could not fault it, so much choice. We were there 14 days and never found it repetative, I dont knwo how you could. It changed every day. Breakfast was my favourite but I just couldnt decide what to have! Tried 3 speciality restaurants and like the sir Edward best but my children liked the buffet best so we stuck with that mostly Rooms - really nice and clean, there was a musty smell when you first walked in but not terrible and after a couple of days we did not notice it. We moved rooms after the first night as we were on the side where there is entertainment going loud and late from the next door hotel and we could really hear it. No problems moving and the smell was in all the rooms so I think just part of this area. Reception - could not be more helpful they were great. Any queries or info we wanted were dealt with straight away and they went out of their way to help. Language no problem, they all spoke pretty good English and actually a couple of the girls on reception were English so always someone who could advise. Service - have holidayed mostly in Europe and so service like this was a revelation to us. The staff here work to hard to make sure you are kept happy and we most definatley were. I dont think we waited more that 20 minutes by the pool for someone to ask what we wanted to drink - then they would just bring round cocktails or sangria, this happened even more on the beach. hope this helps but if you are thinking of going here GO, I do not see how you could be disappointed. Only negative if I have to find one is that the pool bar gets so noisy that it became impossible to drink there - mainly americans who constantly shouted out that they were on vacation and it was time to party/have fun - this actually meant they just turned up the volume to deafening - just avoid the pool bar and this is not a problem.", "Date": "August 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisville", "Title": "\u201cDon't bother!!!\u201d", "Author": "kottaca", "ReviewID": "UR18891331", "Content": "Just returned from a week-long stay.

Rooms: We had a ground level room, please be sure to ask for a higher room so that you do not get eaten alive by mosquitos as I did, although they barely attacked the other girls. The room has a misty feel to it and you can easily slip on tiled floors; this is due to humidity in air. The ac worked very well and we even turned it completely off at night because we were too cold believe it or not. We had two beds piushed together, it was fine, all we did was sleep and shower in the room. Bathroom was fine and turndown service was a great extra treat. Beach: Beautiful! The hotel has placed huge black sand bags in the ocean and shoreline to help prevent the beach from any further erosion. These bags are black and look like whales. They were soooo much fun to climb on top of and jump off into the water. Great fun for all ages. We always found loungers no matter what time of day. Mixed alcohol and virgin drinks came around very frequently. Food: If you want to eat at a restaurant u must be online by 8am everyday to reserve which restaurant you would prefeer to eat at. There are 2 seatings...630 and 845. This procedure sucked and was extremely inconvenient. However, the buffet was open late evey night and we thoroughly enjoyed the variety of choices to pick from. The buffet even had themed nights such as asian, italian, etc. We made it to the Brazilian restaurant once, I recommend skipping it. Breakfast was grreat, you can have your choice of french toast, omlettes to order, sausages, muffins, fruit, etc. Very yummy and well worth waking up early for! Service: Exceptional! This resort was truly all-inclusive. Tips were not expected, though we threw dollars down for those the workers who truly went out of their way for us. A mention goes out to \"Tony\" serving drinks at night and \"Alex\" a waiter. Guests: We met great people from on this trip. Even though we were 4 girls at a family/couple resort, we had a great time. It is the company you hold that defines the kind of time you will have. Shopping: For 5 dollars (50pesos) you can take a cab into town and go shopping. Lots of jewelry shops, food and even beach bars, etc. Well worth going to. Excursions: Lots to do. We went ziplining through the jungle.Uhm, if you are afraid of heights do not try to attempt getting over your fear here. LOL. I was very scared but other girls enjoyed it very much.

Our stay at the Riu was nothing less than perfect from the time we met the bell hop at the front door. I will start with hotel itself. It is VERY clean at all times. From the room, the halls, the common areas and out doors. The staff is constantly cleaning, painting, mowing, ect...Our room was cleaned 3 times a day and our wet bar was always fully stocked and fresh towels after every use. The hotel is very grand and has a very elegant and opulent feel. It has a spanish style decor and a grand lobby with a very old world luxurious feel. The main plaza has beautiful fountains and landscaping leading you down to the beach and the pools. The pool has a swim up bar and a very tranquil feel which is then proceeded by the beach. You walk down through a forest of palm trees covering lounge chairs and hammocks hung from the palm trees and then you come down to the beach and the beautiful aqua blue ocean. On the beach you will find two massage cabanas and a full service bar. That was key! Compared to other hotels, the bar is always up at the pool or the hotel. I also highly recommend a massage on the beach. We found most people were at the beach during the day and retired to the pool for the afternoon. As for the service, we found the staff very polite, helpful and attentive. They always greet you with a smile and seemed so happy to help you. I have never had such wonderful and sincere service anywhere else. When ever we were finished eating, our plates were removed promtly and our drinks were always full. You never sat there looking or waiting for service. The food was also very good and you never seemed to be bored of eating the same thing at the buffet like you do on a cruise. The variety was amazing especialy at breakfast and dinner. I would recommend you try all the fresh juices they make at breakfast, they are delicious! As everyone else has mentioned, you do have to get up early to go down and make dinner reservations in the lounge. We ate in the Brazilian and the steak house restaurants and they were excellent. Because my life is one big schedule, my vacations are not. Therefore, I like to eat when I am ready and not have to leave the beach or pool to get ready for dinner or get up early to make reservations. I found the buffet to be very good and Mexican night was awsome! The buffet offers a fine dining atmosphere with white linens and stem ware and of course excellent service. Now the only two bad things about the whole trip and this is no lie, is the coffee and the ketchup. We seriously said this several times over the vacation. We could not find anything else wrong with this trip. While you are there, make sure you go down to 5th Ave which is all shopping, dining, and drinking. Very cool and must go see at least on night. Oh, you can also get Starbucks down there too! We also went to Chitz and Itza Mayan Ruins. Absolutly amazing and educational. It's an all day trip for a $100 through the Apple Vacation guy in the main lobby. Trip includes beer, soda and full sit down lunch. As far as entertainment, It is ok, If you are looking for high energy, your not going to find it here. You will have to go to the Riu across the street which caters to a much younger crowd, I almost felt like I was back in Cancun on spring break. We kind of think because this is such an upscale hotel, the high energy will not appeal to this clientele. In conclusion, the Riu Palace Mexico is every thing they claim to be and you will not be disappointed unless you are used to staying in hotels that are $10,000 a night. As far as some of these other reviews such as a broken ironing board or because your not greeted with a drink, do you really think that is going to ruin your vacation?

First, this place by far is one of the most appealing places I have seen. Scenery for days. Everything you see on their website as far their photos is just the same in person. But the SERVICE and FOOD is not 5 star quality! I read all the great reviews before I went . I was eager to see what the hype was all about. We got to our room, gorgeous. In the closet the was DIRT on the floor and our ironing board was broken. We advised the front desk, but they could not bring a new one until the next day. The dirt in the closet was not cleaned until 3 days after our stay. Second, the food here SUCKS! I have stayed in CANCUN and the food was way better. The reservation policy is basically first come, first serve. Which no one tells you until you get there. The best tasting food in the the resort is SIR LAWRENCE. But it is the size of my master bedroom, so the resevation goes fast. We ate there twice during our stay, once we had to pay one of the waiters 20 bucks to get us in. (that was the rumor going around how to get in!) Second time we had to get up at 7am and wait in line until 9:30am for the reservation. You have to just sit there and then they give you a number, I felt like I was on a welfare line! People were getting into arguements on who got there first. I paid all that money to stay at a 5 star resort, so I could sit for 2 hours just so I can eat good food? Never heard of this policy. If you do not wait online you will not eat at any of the restaurants that is mentioned on their website. And to make it worse the food at the buffet sucked!

Nothing could have made that vacation any better. We have carried the fondest memories ever since and have been looking to return since that day. Once we knew that we would be returning to Mexico there was only ever one place we would stay. People say that you shouldn't go back to somewhere because it can never live up to your expectations but we didn't find that to be true. As many people have said before, the property, grounds and pools are wonderful. There is a refined elegance to the courtyard area, with its fountains and manicured grounds and a tranquillity to the pool that we have yet to find anywhere else we have stayed. Every member of staff we encountered were excellent. Friendly, attentive and always willing to go the extra mile. I have never felt as relaxed as I do when reading a book by the pool at the Riu Palace (especially with the highly efficient drinks service). Food was again, very good and we enjoyed every meal. We ate at the Steakhouse and Brazilian restaurants and thoroughly enjoyed the experiences. Everyone is different but I had no problem what-so-ever with getting a reservation at the speciality restaurants (despite not generally being a morning person) I would go to the theatre at 8.30, get a number, buy a newspaper, drink a coffee and within 15 minutes, get the reservation I wanted at a time I wanted. On the days I couldn't be bothered to get up early, we ate at the buffet restaurant or went out for a meal at the ever impressive Playa Del Carmen. On our last visit, we didn't catch a single show (too much tequila and sun probably) but this time we stayed up every night and despite me initial scepticism I was very impressed. The singers and bands in the Courtyard were also brilliant. A special mention for the waiting staff at night. I have never seen service like it. We found that there was definitely a wider variety of guests on this visit. Five years ago it was predominantly European couples. This time there were more families (all of the children we saw were wonderfully well behaved) and the entertainment team seemed to be doing an excellent job. There were also more large parties - usually American and they seemed to encompass a wide age range i.e. extended families, not college kids etc. This gave a slightly livelier feel to the evenings than on the previous visit, although nothing like Cancun. My view on some of the complaints I have read here are: there will be some mosquitoes and bugs, what with it being the jungle, but there are considerably less than in some of the other resorts and hotels we've visited in Mexico because the courtyard and grounds are not full of jungle plants - it looks like a palace after all. Due to our experiences and those of people we have met on our trips to Mexico, I find it hard to believe that people are treated rudely or are not provided with a good service. We have never met a staff member who didn't greet as warmly and help in any way they possibly could. Unfortunately, the same could not always be said for the way in which a minority of guests talked to the staff so I wonder if the problem does not lay a little closer to home. (My apologies to any polite guests who have had bad experiences). I was also impressed with the efficiency of the maintenance staff. I noticed two cracked floor tiles in the hallway near our room and the next day the area was being re-laid. My wife and I noticed that the building / room by the pool where you collect and return towels was looking a little tired and two days later it was being painted and improved. At various other times the pools had staff in them scrubbing the tiles whilst others were maintaining the lawns, shrubs and painting the main building. In conclusion, we have had two perfect holidays at the Riu Palace Mexico.

They were taking us all on vacation. We were all so excited...until two days before we were supposed to leave we got a call from the travel agent saying that they had a group in the hotel we were supposed to stay at (Grand Princess Sunset) and they were very unhappy and wanted to switch hotels. YIKES!! So they recommended this resort to us and I am so very glad they did. Here's a brief summary of the resort: Appearance Of Overall Resort: This place is absolutely beautiful. The grounds are well maintained, everything is kept nice and clean. Every day the landscaping folks were out trimming shrubs or cleaning. Everything about the courtyard / entertainment area was very nice...top notch. The only slight downside of the whole place is the ceramic tile everywhere. It can become very slippery. Our grandmother actually slipped on it as soon as we got there. Got a pretty nasty bruise. But if you walk with caution after the rain, it shouldn't be a problem. Rooms: The rooms are very nice. You can see pictures from the reviews of other people on here. You walk into the room and enter a small hallway. There is a bathroom directly to your right. It's got a nice shower and sink area, and the toilet has a door that closes so you can do your business without disturbing others. Through the hallway you enter the sleeping area, basically a big bed (2 doubles with a big headboard). The mattress is kind of uncomfortable but you can request a mattress pad which makes it a lot better! Further past the dining room there is a small living area with a couch and TV. There is also a small sitting area outside but we never sat out there cause it was really hot during the day and at night there were a few mosquitos, but not many. The air conditioning worked great in the room. The mini-bar was always stocked up with sodas and water and a few beers. Pools: The pools were OK. In all reality there could have been more, or it could have been bigger, but we never really had any problems finding a place to sit. I totally was consumed with playing pool volleyball. There is a net setup and the staff always comes around at about 11:00am trying to get people together to play. They'd play for 1/2 hour and then leave to go do other events, but we'd play pool volleyball all day long. In between matches, we'd take a break to visit the pool bar or find some shade to sit in around the pool. Plenty of palms and umbrellas provide the shade. The pool is about 4 feet all the way around...they had a kiddy pool but we never checked it out. Beach: The beach was lovely. Sand whales (big mounds of sand with a black vinyl-type sheet over it to prevent beach erosion) were everywhere but who cares you go to the beach to soak up the sun or hang out in the ocean. There are topless women everywhere...some whom you didn't mind seeing and some whom you wished would put their tops back on!! Plenty of lounge chairs. There were hammocks under the palm trees which looked like a nice way to relax! Nice water, very clear, very clean. Food: Ahh the most important subject!! First off, women can wear whatever they want to restaurants, and basically men can do the same thing except at dinner, men have to wear anything but a tank top / sleeveless shirt, and they have to wear long pants. No shorts. No big deal. For breakfast, they have a sweet buffet at the Don Julian. We ate there alot. Pancakes, french toast, waffles, eggs, meats, bagels, etc. For lunch, we would normally eat at one of the two buffets down by the pool since we were closer there. They had killer pizza (had cream cheese in crust, yummm), burgers, hot dogs, chicken wings, and other stuff. For dinner, if you wanted to eat at the Steakhouse or Japanese, or any other \"non-buffet\" restaurant, you had to schedule a reservation early in the morning (8:30am). We mainly ate at Don Julian because it was just awesome. They had a different menu every night. Good deserts. The people there were very nice and the food was very good so we didn't waste time making reservations and just ate there. The Staff: I have a new opinion of the mexican people after this trip. Everyone at the resort was just so nice. All the staff at the desk were helpful when we needed a crib sent to the room. The room service was very friendly. The people who cleaned our rooms did such a great job and even went as far as organizing the baby's toys in her crib. The restaurant staff was so very kind. They sung happy birthday to our Grandmother on her birthday. The mariachi band sung for our table. They always made sure our glasses were filled. The drink waiters around the pool always made sure we had enough to drink. We knew we didn't have to tip but we were compelled to because these people were just so nice to us. Because of their attitude alone, we'd return to this resort in a heartbeat. In conclusion, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone I knew.

We arrived (myself and one other person) to the resort on Monday evening, June 23rd. We chose this resort because our friends were getting married on June 26th at the RIU Palace Mexico, and we were told the wedding party had to stay at the same resort. The bride and groom arrived the day before (having already provided a list of guest names, provided another list to specify that she wanted all guest rooms to be near each other). Of course, we understand that we won't be right next to each other, however we found ourselves across the hotel in a far corner, nowhere near the bride. We also found ourselves in a room full of mosquitoes. It is June, and there are mosquitoes in Mexico, but we must have killed a dozen mosquitoes in the first hour we were in our room. When we went to the front desk, along with the bride, we asked that we be moved not only for because of the mosquitoes, but also because the bride had previously requested we be in a room much closer to her. We were told that there was nothing that could be done about our room for that night because the resort was full. While I have no proof otherwise, it seems odd that at 5 O'clock on a Monday night during hurricane season that the entire resort was not only full, but that all other guests had checked in making it impossible to switch us from one room to another. We were also told that there are lots of mosquitoes in Mexico, so we should expect mosquitoes. I understand this, but found that I was the only one complaining of killing dozens of mosquitoes including four of them in a matter of a minute on Tuesday morning. We were accommodated that day, having our room switched to a location somewhat closer to the bride with no more mosquitoes. Also, I did get several (around 15 bites not of the mosquito variety all on my ankles while in the first room, which was unpleasant since I don't know what bit me). Unfortunately, our new hotel room, along with all rooms on that side, backed up to the Wyndham Viva that likes to party with club style dance music until around 1:30 in the morning making sleeping a bit difficult to say the least. Obviously, one can't control what another hotel does, but it is something to note regarding staying at this particular hotel on the particular side we were on. Regarding the food, we were disappointed with the rules and restrictions involved in eating, both at our own resort, and at one of the other 5 RIU resorts in the area. First, the all-you-can-eat buffet requires that pants be worn by men (as opposed to shorts) for all dinners. This would be helpful to note before arriving because this is not a requirement at all all-inclusive resorts. Basically if you want to eat anything except room service (all five dinner options) for dinner, you have to wear pants if you are man. One expects to have to dress up to eat at one of the specialty restaurants, if only one could get into ANY of those restaurants. Note: Even though you can go to the other five resorts for other activities, you MUST eat dinner at your own resort. Regarding reservations for the specialty restaurants, we were told when we checked in to go to a certain location between 8:30 and 10am in order to get reservations for each night (note: you have to do this everyday because you can only make reservations for that night). The bride, however, went to the specified location on Monday morning at 9:30 only to find that all specialty restaurants had already been booked. When the bride inquired about why she was told to go between 8:30 and 10am if everything was going to be booked right away, she was then told that you have to get in line at 7:30am, to get a number, that MAY get you to a reservation. What a vacation, stay up late having a good time, but then have to get up at 7:30am if you want to eat at a restaurant besides the all-you- can-eat buffet. AND remember you have to do it everyday! The food itself, once we did get into a specialty restaurant, was lackluster, and was average overall throughout our stay. The rooms were ok, nothing to speak of, except that everyone's TVs seem to work differently. The bride and groom had a TV that turned on without warning in the middle of the night, quite odd I must say, and we all didn't have the same channels, or at least not the same clear channels -- some were fuzzy, or didn't come in well enough to watch. Room service sometimes took 5 minutes, and sometimes took 25 minutes, so there was no consistency there. The floors in the areas around the hotel were always slippery because they were always being cleaned, except for the ones in our rooms which were so dirty that we all put towels down in front of our beds so we could wipe our feet off before we got into bed. The pool was smaller than the other RIU resorts that we visited, but we assumed that it was because this RIU was along the ocean, so you could swim there as well. The pool bar held odd hours, so that you couldn't get certain kinds of drinks unless you got out of the pool and went to a different bar, even though the pool was still open two more hours. The bartender had the ability to walk up a flight of stairs and get us the drinks we asked for, but instead told us that he could only offer us beer, and cocktails had to be obtained elsewhere. As far as the wedding, I would NOT recommend getting married here. There were a lot of rules and restrictions related to the reception such as having to be out of the reception area by your designated time or else they charge you $600 for the extra hour. This was actually written into the contract! Having said that, the people at the reception dinner (the staff) made no effort to keep the dinner moving along so we could meet our deadline, and we found ourselves having to call for the head waiter to get our main course, and to remind him that the cake still needed to be served. There was a birthday taking place at the same time in another part of restaurant, and that took precedence over the wedding party. Now to the fun part of our vacation. We lost power on Wednesday evening between 6pm and 7pm. We dealt with it for a few hours, and it did come back on briefly for some people in some areas of the resort. Other members of the bridal party, however, did not get power back in their rooms until 7:30am the next day. In the meantime, people who found themselves in a similar situation were not given even a candle to light up their rooms until around 1am in the morning, and then it was just a candle, in a drinking glass (very unsafe). When the other members of the bridal party complained, they were told that there was no management on site that was high enough ranking to make a decision, so basically there was NO CONTINGENCY plan, and everyone had to sit in 90 degree heat, with 90% humidity and wait to regain power. Some of us had power off and on thru the night, but not everyone did, and would you believe (because this is what people were told) that of all the other FIVE RIU resorts in the area, there wasn't ONE room available to move guests to until power was regained. Once again, this was not the busy season, and I find it hard to believe that all guest rooms in all 6 RIU resorts were completely full. To summarize, I will not be staying at a RIU resort again, and recommend that other's not stay here as well, and to certainly not get married here.", "Date": "July 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Porto", "Title": "\u201cForget the bad reviews.

We saw about five weddings the week we were there...the one in the center courtyard was exceptionally breath taking... In conclusion, take the negative reviews with a grain of salt...this is a beautiful resort with charming employees and we'll be looking to go again next June Cheers Cheryl", "Date": "June 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cMarried at the RIU Palace Mexico\u201d", "Author": "Extras678", "ReviewID": "UR17168510", "Content": "My now husband and I decided to do a Destination Wedding last year.

We were assigned to the RIU Palace Mexico from 7 to 14 June 2008. We had stayed at RIU's previously and know them to be a decent hotel but nowhere near a 6 Apple (HIghest category Apple Vacations assigns). This particular RIU was worse than anything I have ever experienced in a hotel. Giving it a 3 Apple rating would be generous! The staff was in no way up to par. I can only recall running into two employees that made us feel we were on vacation. The room situation was simply ridiculous. Upon check in we asked for an ocean view and were told they did not have ocean views. We were told we could get either a pool or courtyard view if we waited for an hour or so. We waited and returned to receive our room key. We got to the room (1125) to find we were facing the trees at the back of the resort and the back of the neighboring resort. We also found a well lived in room. When I called the front desk to ask for the room we were told we'd get I was told that rooms with view were $40 extra per person, per night. When I informed the young lady we were told we would get a room with a view if we waited the additional money was reiterated. After going back and forth a while I was told we could get a room with a view in two days, but I had to come to the front desk by 10 am on the day of the move to let them know we wanted to move. I still don't understand that, but we agreed. Later we find we have a colony of ants parading up a bed side dresser and a ledge where my husband had clothes. We had to track down a housekeeper in the halls to come combat the bugs. We had to stick it out in this room until we could move. The next surprise was the realization that the neighboring hotel's night club was right on the other side of the fence we faced. It was a long and loud night. Our next morning, Sunday, we found out we had to go to a designated location between 8:30 and 10:30 each morning to make a dinner reservation. This was horrible, what an unwelcome daily vacation activity. When I went to the front desk to complaint to a supervisor, I waited for about 15 minutes to talk to a woman who told me no one had ever complained about their system and, at least 4 times told me I could make the reservation anytime within the 2 hour window. This trip was off to a bad start! The second day, Monday, I went to the desk early to confirm we want to take the room with a view. I asked more than once that they have some one check the new room for bugs before we moved. It seemed as though I was bother in the young lady, but she finally said she would. We returned to the desk later and receive the new key. We entered the new room (1063) to find another well lived in room. I headed to the window and opened the darkening drapes to find bugs crawling up the drapes. I immediately called the desk to ask for help. It took 20 minutes or so before someone arrived. The man killed the bugs I pointed out plus some that he found in another place. He cleaned up and left us with the can of Raid. That was certainly not a comforting thing. I began looking around the room and here is a list of what was found: - BUGS - A rusty safe - Corroding handle on toilet - Crude/mold at base of toilet lid - Rusting wall connection/water cut off for toilet - Broken bar for the handheld shower head - Crude/mold around and above the shower curtain bar - Crude abound the tub - Crude in the bottom of the tub - Broken bath gel dispenser and bath get sitting to the side - Silver finish coming off of the assistance bar for the tub. - Ill fitting cover for the Kleenex receptacle in the sink - Green crude around facet handles of the sink and bidet - Stained bed sheets - Stained pillow cases - Cushions that were too small for the love seat - Chipped soap dish on the sink - Corroding magnifying mirror - Dirty vent and surround - Dirty/molding room service menu - Stains on the walls - Paint chipping off of the handles to the patio When the front desk was notified of the problems, I got no assistance. Having book an Apple Vacation, I decided to see our representative when he returned the next morning. We went out to enjoy the grounds and have dinner. The maid had come while we were out. She left the light on and the bugs were having a great time flying around in the lighted room. I spent the next while chasing bugs with Raid bug spray. I was a basket case. Once I was finally able to wind down, the chase was on again. After not seeing anything move for a while I finally laid down. It was a horrible night of feeling like things were crawling all over us. The next morning I got up to go see Luis, but first I saw bugs crawling on the 2nd bed and then a couple in the bed we were in. I felt sick! I saw the Apple Rep, Luis, and told him of the unacceptable conditions in the room and the poor service around the hotel. He just gave me a blank look. I told him how we had bugs in the 1st room and even after asking the desk staff to check the second room we had bugs in it also. Luis told me that maybe this was just a \"general\" problem like that would make it okay. I explained that for what we paid and for what Apple said we were going to get, this was unacceptable. I had taken pictures with my cell phone and showed them to Luis. This did not cause Luis to be any more helpful. Luis asked what I wanted him to do about it and I told him to move us to an actual top rated hotel. He acted as if I did not say anything to him. I told him that no one from the hotel management, nor he, had ever even asked to come see the room that housed these horrid conditions. Again there was no response. I was furious and frustrated. I asked to speak to his supervisor. After a while he got a supervisor on the phone. He spoke with her and then gave the phone to me so I could repeat my plight. She apologized, saying she'd contact the hotel. Luis came back to say we could move back to the first room (1125) we were in. I explained to him that that was not an option, because that room had bugs. Why would we go back to that room? Luis left and came back again to say he and a housekeeping supervisor would come see the room. Luis and I went to room 1063 and I showed him the laundry list of problems. Minutes later the housekeeping supervisor came. It was the same many who had sprayed the day before. Luis showed him the problems, during which two men appeared with industrial fumigation canisters. Apple was not going to move us to a decent, top of the line hotel. Our offer was to move to our first bug infested room or let them work on the on new room. Having no recourse, we got things together exited the room and let them work on the room. We returned hours later to find a few things fixed and there were no bugs in plain sight. I tried to tell Luis but he was not around. He did call later. After we returned from dinner that night, Tuesday, we did not see bugs. You do not know how relieved I was. I wish all of the problems had disappeared. Even so, we still could not enjoy the room and I was tense for the whole vacation. I never got rid of the felling that things were crawling on me. I still shutter when I think of it. We feel like we were robbed. We paid too much to end up in a place that does not value it's customers and takes no pride in there service or their accommodations. We have yet to hear a response from Apple Vacations or the RIU Hotels. We were thoroughly disgusted! No one helped us. RIU Hotels and Apple Vacations really pulled one over on us!!

Price was $999 per person plus tax and trip insurance. Have stayed at 4 Apple, 5 Apple, and 6 Apple resorts. This is a solid 5 Apple Resort. CHECK IN: I am a Riu Class Club member. They took a copy of my card at check in. I had my Trip Advisor hat in my carryon, but did not pull it out and got good service from the front desk (I did mention it was our 6th Riu resort visit). It was 10 a.m. and our room was ready. ROOMS: We were given a ground floor room (#0052) facing the fountains. Very clean with lovely towel art. Fridge was stocked with water, Corona, Pepsi, Pepsi lite, orange and lemon/lime sodas. Liquor dispenser had Rum, Vodka, Tequila and Brandy. Bed linens were clean and fresh, but beds were very firm and pillows were flat. The one in the closet was a little fluffier. Towels were fluffy and absorbent. There were 2 bath towels, 2 hand towels, 2 bidet towels, and 2 smaller towels on the vanity. They sprayed for bugs a couple nights when they did turndown service. Did not have bugs in the room. Air conditioner worked very well. Remote stopped working and was replaced right away. FOOD: There is a breakfast buffet below the lobby. There are 2 buffets available throughout the day for lunch, one is just off the beach but you must wear shoes and a cover-up (no beach snack bar where you can grab a bite in your swimsuit). You must make dinner reservations in person at the Theatre below the lobby near the restaurants between 8:30 and 10:00 a.m. You may only reserve for that night. What a pain and waste of time to have to get up and stand in line to get a reservation for dinner. We ate at the Brazilian and Sir Edwards (Krystal menu) which were good. We never got reservations for the Steakhouse or the Japanese. The dinner buffet had many choices. Even picky eaters should find something to eat. Food was better than most All Inclusives (unless you have allergies). We went into PDC for dinner and drinks one night and spent way more than we thought we would. Things have gotten a bit pricey in PDC! BARS: There is a bar on the beach, and they bring trays of drinks around for you to choose from (water, Pepsi, pina colada, something strawberry, beer). There is a pool bar and waiter service around the pool area. The lobby bar had a piano with live music in the evening and a nice Martini menu. It is open until 7 a.m. for the insomniacs. They offered Beefeaters and Gordons, Absolut and Smirnoff, Bacardi and Havana Club, Modelo, Don Julio, J & B, Jim Beam, Johnny Walker Red, and much more. There is NO Coke at this resort. Rum & Pepsi??? Service was good at all bars. Especially Elena in the lobby bar. BEACH: There are many large \u201csand bags\u201d set up to help stop the beach erosion. They pumped sand every day but it will be a very slow recovery. The water is still nice, rough first 2 days then very calm. Just depends on the weather. The constant pounding of Jet Skis and smell of the fuel were irritating, but I guess you get used to it. POOLS: Plenty of lounge chairs and umbrellas. Cushions are covered in plastic and get very hot in the sun, but fine if you put your towel down. Pool was clean the first 2 days (it rained a couple hours late in the day). By the 4th day it was looking a little cloudy. The Jacuzzi water was warmer than the pool, but not heated. INTERNET/PHONE: Internet runs VERY slow. I had problems with my cell phone and went online to my account to find out what to do and as soon as I got to the page where the info was I was booted off. I ended up buying a phone card to call home. Make sure you activate your International cell service before you leave the US. I did so in September before our trip to RM, then went to Punta Cana in December with no problem, but this trip was not able to use my cell (AT&T). PROBLEMS: #1 They do not cater to any special needs. If you have a food allergy be careful. Ala carte restaurants are usually best for food cooked to order, but they would not assist with reservations. The Buffet Manager gave some assistance, but we corrected him on a few items, so it was really \u201ceat at your own risk.\u201d #2 There are only 2 elevators, both in the lobby area. There are long corridors and pathways from the lobby to the beach/pool. If you have difficulty walking distances and climbing stairs this may not be a good choice for you. APPLE VACATIONS: This was our 25th trip using Apple. We have done the Square Apple Deal in the past with no problems at all. When we checked in at the airport we were supposed to get our hotel information in plenty of time to call home. Our Apple Rep didn\u2019t show up until we were on the plane. We were given the hotel info and phone number but had no way to contact our family at this point. Our Apple Orientation was at 4:30 that day. We knew we didn\u2019t want to go on any excursions so we gave the Apple Rep our return transfer card after waiting for him to book several people on excursions. It seems they are more interested in selling tours than taking care of your needs once you arrive. We had asked the front desk staff about reservations in the restaurants regarding dietary needs. They do not bend at all. The answer is \u201cNO!\u201d They were no help at all. We didn\u2019t expect special treatment and would take any restaurant at any hour (at other 5* resorts we\u2019ve had no problem and this is a 6*). We went to our Apple Rep the next day. He could not help us and told me to choose 3 other resorts and made some calls and told us to come back later. We were told it would be an additional $1000 - $2500 for our last 5 nights. Not sure if we would have any better luck at those resorts we decided to stay and enjoy the rest of our vacation. The day before departure we still had not been notified of our pickup time for our transfer to the airport. There is usually a book with all the flights and pickup info (after 25 trips I know this) but the page was missing. The front desk clerk told me the Rep would be back at 3:00. I left a message for the Rep at the front desk asking to be contacted with the pick up time. At 5:00 I hopped in the shower and realized we never got a message. I called and of course, she never received my note from the front desk. She was leaving at 6:00 and I needed to pick up my transfer voucher by then or miss my transfer, which was scheduled for 6:10 a.m. I was still wrapped in my towel, and told her I would rush. About 10 minutes later she knocked on my door and handed me the voucher. (We ended up waiting in the airport for almost 4 hours and our flight was on time!)

A few of our fellow TA's booked a fantastic deal through FunJet's Fun for Less 5 star program, which allows Funjet to pick the hotel for you a week before you depart. I had no problems with the booking process through Funjet or the included Lomas airport transfers. I did buy the cancellation insurance in case of a tropical storm (we were there at the start of hurricane season). I do have to say that when booking the Fun for Less package, make sure you are completely flexible in terms of where you stay, as if there is any reason you want to move, like if you have already stayed at a particular property or want to keep your large group together you may be out of luck. With that said, I would do this deal again for the right price! Overall: While Funjet categorizes this hotel as 5 stars, I wouldn't agree that the RPM is a 5 star property. It is a very solid 4 star property with stellar service, immaculate grounds and good food. I apologize that I'm repeating previous reviews, but I think it's helpful to read a complete opinion. The Room: In terms of design, I think the rooms are the biggest disappointment of the RPM, which is the main reason why I give it 4 stars instead of 5. They are dated, think decor of an older Courtyard Marriott. The bed is actually 2 full sized beds pushed together with one enormous headboard. The beds are even made separately. If you are a snuggler with your bedmate, this can be awkward as someone will be wedged in the crack. The beds themselves are very very hard with a plastic crinkle sound. I assume this is to protect the mattresses from humidity, but it was similar to the noise a pad cover you might give to your potty-training toddler makes. There is one very genius design in the rooms that I can't believe all hotels don't have - a double door design in the room, so there is the main door, then a hallway with the bathroom, then another door that leads to the bedroom. Not only does this help with hallway noise insulation, but in an unfamiliar bedroom suite it makes it a lot easier in the middle of the night to shut that door then turn on the bathroom light and not have to worry about bothering your partner. Also there is a \"master\" light switch, so when you come in and out you can turn the lights off and on with one switch, and you don't have to run to each of the lights. The much publicized minibar is a convenient way to get water and grab a cocktail while getting ready for dinner. It would be nice if they had some sort of mixers for the Tequila, Vodka and Rum (there's also Brandy). We made use of the room safe to keep our passports and money while we were in the resort, however, be warned that they are small so a 15\" laptop won't fit in them. They are keyed, with a little lock that they give you at the front desk, along with your room key (another real key as opposed to key card). The bathrooms are unremarkable, but get the job done. I did like the water closet design, with a sliding door for the toilet and bidet. Make sure to ask for extra towels if you use more than one per person in 24 hours. They provide tiny bottles of lotion and the gel dispenser in the shower is a shampoo/body wash combo so bring your own if you're at all particular. There is a step down to a small living area with a mini couch, coffee table, dresser (where the breakfast room service door tags and hotel stationary are) and a tiny tiny TV with a good number of channels, both in Spanish and English. Our room and balcony overlooked the Riu next door but we didn't mind this as we spent so little time in the room. I heard it's more to upgrade to a room overlooking the interior courtyard, but if you go to sleep early I would avoid these as the nightly entertainment echoes down the center of the property. Our room was very very quiet, never did we get jarred from sleep with noisy people, I thank the hydrolic doors and double door arrangement. We did not experience any musty smells as previous reviewers did, but we were on the 2nd floor. All in all I think a minor room decorating redo would help this property immensely. Corridors and Overall Hotel Layout: I understand the Riu Palaces try to mimic a real palace with interior courtyards and rooms surrounding them, but this does not take advantage of the property's greatest asset - proximity to the sea! I think 4 rooms in the entire resort have an ocean view. The pathways are all tiled, so if it rains (it did a few days while we were there) they turn into a skating rink. Ladies if you wear heels to dinner make sure to grab your escort's arm! There are only 2 elevators at the property, so if you are at all physically challenged or just plain klutzy, try to get a room on the first floor as the stairs are tiled too! Restaurants, Bars and A la Carte Process: We didn't find the reservation process to be a big deal. Get down to the Mariachi bar (where the nighly entertainment is) by 8:30 and you'll get a number card (no waiting in line) and we never had a problem getting the restaurants we wanted. We did not have a chance to eat at the Steakhouse (El Patio by day) as there were wedding parties there the nights we tried to go. But La Bodega, the Brazilian, was the highlight of the a la cartes in our opinion. Try the chimichurri sauce with your meat, it's fantastic. Sir Edward, the Gourmet, was the biggest disapointment. Everything had some type of foam on it, but foam does not make a gourmet meal. The highlight there was the chocolate cake sundae. Miyagi, the Japanese, was ok. The sushi had the wrong rice and all the rolls oddly had (goat?) cheese in them. The tempura was good, as was the miso soup. The entrees were better than the sushi. Don Julian, the buffet was amazing (men - don't forget your pants!). There are theme nights, international, chinese, etc., but we always went for the Mexican food that they have every night (we're in Mexico, right?). The guacamole (both varieties) was incredible, as was the pico de gallo and red and green salsas. I thought the house wines were sufficient, but we are not too particular. Breakfast buffets were outstanding, with a full range of standard American breakfast items, made to order omelet bars, smoothie stations, mimosas and bloody marys, pastries, fresh fruit, cereal, anything you could want. We ate lunch mostly at El Patio, where we could go from the beach in our coverups and sandals (do remember your coverups and sandals as you will be turned away without them). The room service is dismal, don't bother as restaurant dining is almost always available from 7am to 10:30 pm. The lobby bar has sandwiches until 7am when they close for 3 hrs until 10am. The bar in the pool is small, so stake out your spot early if you want a seat in the water. Pool and Beach: The pool is the second biggest reason the RPM gets 4 stars. It is small with two separate sections. We spent most of our time on the beach - the grounds there are incredible. They have split many of the loungers in the area between the pool and the water's edge into twos. There are ten hammocks or so in this area, most big enough for 2. We spent most of our days there. The beach bar is small and lines do form. Once in awhile, attendants would make the rounds with drinks on trays. There is an annoying towel card system, where you only get 1 towel and if you lose your card or the towel it's $20 so keep tabs on them! I can't say I enjoyed the sand whales, but I am glad the beach has improved to a gradual slope into the water, unlike at the Riu or the Wyndham next door that is more sandy cliffs. The European women sunbathe topless, which certainly didn't bother us. The pool was more interesting at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya, which we have guest access to, but we didn't bother staying there long as we preferred the sandy beach, which was much nicer at the RPM. Service: Outstanding and friendly! Learn some basic Spanish if you can (iTunes has great podcasts), it helps with some of the waitstaff. Plus you are in Mexico after all! They really appreciate the tips. Location: Across the street there are touristy shops and the property is less than a 5 minute drive ($5 USD cab ride) from Playa del Carmen. We did stay mostly on the property as everything was paid for. If you would like to change some USD to Pesos, there is an ATM across the street at Santander Bank. I use Bank of America, and I had no fee to use the ATM and a better exchange rate than exchange houses. Entertainment: Corny, but they put 100% into the shows. There is a nice outdoor seating area to enjoy music and drinks. Some of the bands were good, highlight being the mariachis. There is free wifi internet access in the lobby for those of those who want (or need) to be connected with your own notebooks, otherwise they have laptops to rent in the lobby by 15 min, hour, day, or 3 day increments. My Verizon cell worked at the property, at the obscene rate of $0.99/min. Luckily I knew this ahead of time, but beware if you want to chat or text. They will also need to activate international calling features so make sure to set this up in advance.", "Date": "June 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toms River, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cWonderful stay\u201d", "Author": "tony838", "ReviewID": "UR16718489", "Content": "At the RPM service is the name of the game, best service I have ever had.

Everyone is very friendly and they make sure that nothing misses on your vacation, either it is food, drinks, amusement. The beach is what you see. The \"whales \" are there, but there is still A BEACH and a great one. (see pictures) We walked to both ends of it, and to the right, Iberostar's beach was absolutely terrible and to the left, to Viva Wyndham, there was a beach but a terrible sewage smell. I also visited all other Riu's and none seemed better than this one. Classy but relaxed. If you like walking or jogging, there is a big \"avenue\" leading to a Plaza where you can go to, outside the hotel. Felt perfectly safe and the walking was quite good to digest all those wonderful meals. Objective facts about the hotel Rooms: - all junior suites, 2 gigantic beds pushed together, big balcony, mini-bar, big bathroom, Tv, iron and ironing board inside the closet. Restaurants: - Don julian (fuffet) - Rodizio (brazilian) - Italian restaurant - Gourmet restaurant (fantastic, yummy) Thematic dinners: Asian, Mexican (everyday), International, Seafood Bars: - one by the reception, one near Don JUlian, one by the pool and one at the beach (opened from 10 amto 17pm) Pools: - 2 pools plus a children's pool and a jacuzzi one on the right side of the hotel. Available: - yellow towels that you have to pick up in the morning;books if you forgot to take some with you. Animation team: - they are non stop and very nice (and funny). If I return to Mexico (not right away because I'll be leaving to Jamaica in a month and a half) I will certainly chose Riu Palace Mexico again, no doubt whatsoever.

We have traveled to all inclusives in St. Lucia, Jamaica, and Dominican Republic. This resort probably ties for our favorite. I'd say the service was by far the best we have ever had. Check in was quick and easy. No issues with the room at all. The beds in our room had matress pads on them so we did not find them uncomfortable. That musty smell people complain about is the smell of the Carribean. Every place we've ever stayed at in the Carribean had a musty smell. Doesn't bother us since we just crank up the A/C which seems to do the trick. Maid service was outstanding. We always had plenty of fresh towels and linens. We really spent most of our time at the beach and a little time each day at the pool. Plenty of loungers anytime of the day whether beach or pool! We have had issues at other resorts where people reserved loungers before 7am. We really didn't see any of that here so it was a relief! The location of this hotel was really great. We walked to Playa Del Carmen about everyday. It was about a 25 minute leisurely walk. We ended up taking cabs back at $5 per ride. Not bad at all. One evening we took the ferry from Playa to Cozumel. After several drinks in Cozumel we got seasick on the ferry back to Playa. LOL. In all fairness the water was very choppy and weren't the only people getting seasick. Food was okay. We felt the buffet was like a good college cafeteria. Plenty of options for sure. Only ate at one specialty resturant which was the Brazilian place. It was okay. We weren't able to get down early enough in the morning to reserve the other specialty places. We ended up eating dinner in Playa Del Carmen and Cozumel a couple nights just to do something different. I will say that everywhere we ate we had amazing service which really goes a long way.

This was our 4th trip to this hotel and the first time since the hurricane of a couple of years ago. As usual, we had a great time and really enjoyed our stay. The staff was great, the food was excellent and the hotel and grounds were in wonderful shape. The beach had definitely seen some changes from the last time we were there. There have been some very large black sandbags placed along the waters edge to help prevent further beach erosion. There were plenty of lounge chairs available along the beach in the sun and also back in the palm trees where it is better shaded. The beach sand was fine & the swimming in the ocean was fine. The only problem was the sandbags placed along the shoreline. If a pristine shoreline is of extreme importance to you I would say you might want to think hard about this hotel but any of the hotels along this stretch will have the same problem as the Riu Palace Mexico with the exception of maybe the Gala (Sandos Playacar) which is the last hotel in the line going south. I don't know anything about their hotel but their beach looked to be in great shape. The Riu Palace Mexico hotel did however have the best beach of any of the other waterfront Riu hotels in this area-The Riu Palace Riviera Maya, Riu Yucatan or the Riu Playacar. We ate at one of the specialty restaurants almost every night during our stay and the food and dining experience was always excellent. I can't say enough about the staff as they were always there for you when needed. Of all the times we have stayed at this hotel, I believe the grounds and landscaping was as nice as I have ever seen. We loved the bands and dancing that they provided almost every evening before and after dinner. We would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a nice quiet vacation that is reasonably priced and a great value. I agree with some of the other reviewers on this website that you should take any negative reviews with a grain of salt as we have always found this hotel to be everything we expected and more.

We had a wonderful time. Six apple rating is accurate for this hotel. I am going to be as honest as I can in my description. Food: Very good. They have to also include food that Europeans enjoy too so you see a lot of sliced meats and some odd food that we aren't used to. They had pretty much something for everyone. The only negative was the getting the reservations to the speciality restaurants. They gave out numbers starting at 8 am and started the process of booking times at 8:30 every morning . It wasn't a problem for us because we were up early, but could be a problem for those who like to sleep late. If you missed out on the restaurants the buffet was extremely good. A nice lady working the omlette station even went out of her way to go and get spinach for my omlette which I thought was great service. So much food you will not go hungry. Men do have to wear long pants for dinner, even in the buffet. Speciality restaurants good, we enjoyed all four of them. Hotel and Grounds: Beautiful. The hotel was extremely clean and lovely. You always seen people cleaning and working on the upkeep. Very upscaled and classy. Room: Wonderful. Large room with a self serving bar in the closet with a fridge in a closet. The best thing was the air pressure gauge on all the doors. It kept the doors from slamming when the guest came in late or up early. This was a real plus in my book after staying at other hotels and being awakening all hours of the night. The only negative was there were a few days when the staff were talking louder in the halls early in the monring. The room cleaning staff were great. Pool: Fair. Very relaxing and I enjoyed it, but I liked the pool at the Rui Palace Playa much more. I didn't like the design, it broke up into two sections. A plus was that they had plenty of staff waiting on you around the pool. Lots of chairs and shade. Another negative thing was they didn't have any activites around the pool except volleyball. Other hotels I stayed made being at the pool so much fun. At the Rui Mexico it was just relaxing. Beach: Good. Plenty of chairs and you could always find a chair in the shade or sun whichever you preferred. All the hotels in Playa Del Carmen have these larged sand filled bags in the water that takes away from some of the beauty. I'm guessing that after the last hurricane they had to protect the beach. Shows: This is the only reason that I did not give this hotel the top rating of excellent. I have stayed at several hotels in Playa Del Carmen and Cancun so I had something to compare it to. I was not impressed with the shows, they were disappointing to me. I only enjoyed one show \"Michael Jackson\" which was very entertaining and I would recommend not to miss it. I wouldn't recommend this hotel for 20s or 30s if they are out for a good time. It is really laid back and relaxing--not too much action for people who want to party.

A little annoying considering that this must happen quite frequently. Once we got to the right spot, the check in went well. But when we got to the room, we were overcome by the smell of mildew.....we went back to the front desk and asked for a different room. They gave us the keys to a different room but when we checked that out it also smelled. They then offered to have an aromatist (I didn't know there was such a thing) come to our room to fix the smell.....awhile later, a cleaning woman came and sprayed air freshener of some sort in the room. It masked the smell for awhile but the mildew smell was pretty bad. We complained again and a couple of hours later we were given a different room. We could tell that it had recently been \"aromatized\" but it was better than the original room we were given. So, we decided to switch rooms and see how the smell went......it was much better but still smelled like mildew. We got used it to and decided to stick out the 3 days that we were there in that room.

Not the brightest rooms but everything you could want...2 double beds pushed together, a mini bar and optics which is restocked daily and a great bathroom with shower and bath. The room is tidied a couple of times a day and the even come in to check your air con and close your curtains. They even sorted out my makeup and would hang up my clothes for me! I put a few things in my safety box but I felt that I could leave anything out and it would be safe... and it was! The food is fantastic with so many restaurants to choose from.

The pool and beach are stunning with regular drinks brought to you while you sunbathe and they even warn you if you look like you are burning. The pool with the swim up bars has great activities daily and the staff are fantastic. During the day you will find Raul at the swim up bar and Fernando all day there. Great guys who make your stay top notch! The pool is clean and has more than enough loungers to go around.

We booked the 6 Apple Square Deat about one month ago. It was very nice: good service, nice rooms, pretty grounds, lovely beach (despite \"sand whales\"). We arrived with the intention of requesting and, if necessary, paying for an upgraded room. This resort has no ocean view rooms, however, and our reception agent really discouraged us from paying more for a courtyard (view of beautiful fountains) room over a garden (view of the next resort). We hemmed and hawed and he eventually gave us a courtyard room, which actually faced the pool and was as close to the beach as you could get, for no additional cost. We were very pleased with the location of our room. The beds were very hard as other reviewers have mentioned, but not worth fussing about. The room was spotless and a small leak from the a/c unit was fixed immediately. Housekeeping also responded immediately to our request for more towels. The food was very good in the buffet restaurant. Having been to \"a la carte\" restaurants at other AI's we opted to fore go the experience this time around. One nice touch was that regardless of the cuisine of the day, they always offered several delicious, authentic Mexican dishes, as well. One negative was the quality of the drinks. It was virtually impossible to get a proper cocktail. Even when you ordered liquor straight up, it didn't seem quite right. Wine and beer with meals were fine, and this certainly wouldn't cause me NOT to recommend the place, however if you're a connoisseur, this shortcoming might matter to you. Overall, we had a great time. The beach was really lovely and the numerous palm trees provided adequate shade throughout the day. One point about the beach however: so many people smoke there that rather than sea air wafting about, much of the time it just smelled like cigarettes. If you're sensitive to this, plan to isolate yourselves, which is entirely possible on the spacious beach area. I'm not sure I detected significant difference between this \"6 Apple\" resort and the \"5 Apple\" Iberostar we stayed at last fall. But overall, we had a lovely vacation.

Our holiday didn't get off to a good start with a 2 hr delay at Gatwick due to ' a delay in preparing the paperwork resulting from the merger of TUI and First Choice'. However checking in at the Hotel was smooth and our luggage appeared in our room within 5 minutes. Due to the delay we were tired and didn't fancy changing for dinner, so we called room service. Within 15 mins 2 nice rounds of sandwiches and nachos arrived. The room was comfortable and spacious, with a small balcony. The view wasn't great-just the side of the next hotel. However, it was nioce to sit there with a drink from the well stocked fridge or mini-bar. The only criticsm of the room was the bath, if you are disabled you might find it difficult to get in or out of the bath/shower. We didn't use the speciality restaurants because my partner did'nt fancy the vegetarian options, but Don Julians more than made up for this with its varied menu, and the fantastic ice scupltures at dinner. We spoke to the Head Chef on our last night and he told us they have 87 chefs! The resturant staff were very good, a drink was usually on your table within 3 minutes of sitting down. Again the choice of drinks was good (beer, wine oe soft drinks) We tended to stay by the pool, largely because the beach area had little shade, which always had sun loungers available. Within 5 minutes of laying down a waiter would be around asking if you wanted a drink. Experienced swimmers might find the pool a little small. We didn't join in the day time activities, although they seemed well attended. In the evening we would have a drink outside and watch the entertainment for an hour. It was OK, but we always ended up in the PIano Bar which was quieter. Must mention the Reception Staff, there was always 2 or 3 staff on reception which meant little delay if you had a query. On arrival we didn't have any cold water, Katy (an English girl) on reception took our problem and had it dealt with immediately. She rang the next day to see if everything was OK-nice touch. If you are considering a trip to Chichen Itza be warned it's a 3hr drive and you arrive around mid-day. The site is well worth seeing, but there is little shade for the hottest part of the day.

My wife and I have just returned from a 7 night stay at the Riu Palace Mexico. Just to give this review some context, we are from England and would call ourselves seasoned travellers - both in our mid 30\u2019s, we have travelled extensively as a couple all over the world. First impressions as we pulled up outside the hotel were excellent. As you walk through the automatic doors and enter the grand palatial air-conditioned reception/lobby, we were blown away. You could almost see your face in the highly polished floor! Sure we\u2019d seen photos on here but the place in real life was just spectacular. With chandeliers a plenty it certainly felt very regal, elegant and grand, just as we\u2019d hoped! The front desk reception staff were very welcoming, helpful and always happy and cheerful. Check in was easy, professional and quick. Our luggage was delivered to our second floor room within 5 minutes. The room was outstanding. Very large and cleaned to a very high standard - those Mexican cleaners sure know how to clean well! I was chuffed to bits at the size of the room, just so much space. It was split level with a lower seating area towards the end where the balcony doors were. The balcony looked out over the beautifully landscaped courtyard, fountains and gardens which run through the centre of the grounds. There was so much storage space too, drawers and cupboards all over, much more than anyone could possibly use. The fitted wardrobe was large and contained an iron and ironing board and a free to use safe. We were welcomed by a fruit platter and a bottle of tequila in the room which was a nice touch. The refrigerator was full with bottles of Corona, carbonated soft drinks, and mineral water. The in room optics contained a good selection of premium branded tequila, brandy, vodka, and white rum. Very handy for a drink on the balcony before going out for the evening! The bathroom is the first door to your right (or left depending on layout) as you enter the room. It comprised of one sink (with giant mirror), slightly sunken bath with shower, and a toilet area which had a sliding door for privacy. No issues with the bathroom, it was absolutely fine and all functioned perfectly. The beds were very large and extremely comfortable with firm mattresses. Personally I much prefer a firm mattress \u2013 I find it much more comfortable and a lot better for your back. Surely nobody wants a \u201cback problem creating\u201d soft mattress with a big dip in the middle? As previous reports on here suggest, it was actually two double beds pushed together to form one monster size bed, but that was absolutely fine. I really can\u2019t understand these people who moan about the beds \u2013 just unbelievable. We had no problems with the room service menu \u2013 it featured around 10 food/snack items and unlimited drinks of any kind available 24hrs. You can also order ice for your ice bucket via this route. Ok, the room service food choice wasn\u2019t massive but there was other food readily available throughout the hotel from 7am till 1am anyway. The speciality restaurant dinner reservation system was very easy \u2013 just a quick and simple visit to the theatre area between 8.30am and 10.30am where one of the guest services staff were taking bookings for that evening. Check of the menu, pick a restaurant, and book a table sitting - Easy, no trouble at all. We booked 2 restaurants on separate occasions and the reservation took no longer than a few minutes. The food overall was superb. Normally I\u2019m quite fussy with food but I ate like a king for the week. I ate much more than I normally would and tried so many new things. The buffet (Don Julian) was really good \u2013 I mean tens of real tasty and well prepared dishes, with all the attention to detail in presentation and layout that you would expect from a hotel of this standard. Each night there was a theme at the buffet, but always had the Mexican selection area open in addition to the theme (Oriental night was our favourite). The speciality restaurants were just ok, but too much seafood on the set menus for our liking. Much preferred the buffet. Drinks at the bars were plentiful and I was overjoyed to see that all premium branded liquor/spirits were included and available. Some brands were not on display at the bars (one or two were kept hidden in a cupboard) but were printed on the drinks menus and were readily available should you ask for one. The ice in all drinks is purified water and none of the drinks that I had seemed watered down at all. I tried several of the liquors/spirits in shooter style just to be sure and each tasted every bit as strong as back home. Have I mentioned the service yet? Wow, the service was something else. Excellent in every way \u2013 from the bar staff at the bars to the waiters in the restaurants. Your drink was always being topped up and they just couldn\u2019t do enough for you \u2013 always with a smile too! Just brilliant! The beach was beautiful, with plenty of room. I was glad to see that after the storms wrecked it some time ago, a lot of the beach has now returned and is deep enough to provide room for at least 3 rows of loungers in the sunshine and then several back in the shade under the palms. We never had a problem getting one at any time of the day. White powder soft sand is in abundance and the sea is a beautiful turquoise colour \u2013 it was like getting into a warm bath. There were no rocks or anything sharp on the ocean floor close to the beach, just soft sand underfoot in the sea. On 2 days out of 7 there were a couple of choppy sea days that were great fun. Bobbing in the waves and swimming with the larger ones as they crashed towards the beach was terrific! The large black sand whales installed to help restore the beach right along the coastline in both directions are very obvious, but to be honest after a few days you really get used to them. They just look like rocks! Thankfully they were installed with beach users in mind - there are large gaps periodically so that you can enter and exit the sea directly from the beach without having to climb over them. The pool was ok, a little small for the size of the place I thought but then I\u2019m a pool person and I like big Caribbean style lagoon pools! It was an odd shape, like a large star split into two divided by the pool bar/terrace bar, toilets, and towel exchange. One side seemed to be the quiet relaxing part, while the other side was where the swim up bar was located and where the daily pool activities took place. There were plenty of sun loungers available all day long on both sides - I don\u2019t remember seeing one time when all loungers were occupied. As you are able to use the Facilities at all the other Riu hotels in the area, we visisted each hotel on a different day and night to check out the vibe and see if they would be worth staying at in the future. I can safely say that we thought we were staying at the best one overall (although the pool at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya was better than ours!) The Riu Tequila opposite was good fun however the service and abundance of drinks were somewhat limited. It had a nice square shaped outside terrace bar, and a disco (La Pinata) which was open from 11pm till 2am. This was quite small (could only have about 60 people in it at any one time) but the music was pretty good and good for a change of scenery. The pool at the Riu Playacar next door was worth a dip too, a bit more Caribbean like than the other hotels pools. We also had a good night out in Playa Del Carmen. We took a taxi there and back to avoid the approx 2 mile walk (wife couldn\u2019t manage the trek in \u201cstrappy sandals\u201d as she put it!). Some of the eating places in town looked lovely and it\u2019s a shame we didn\u2019t eat out. Will do next time though at least once. Anyway, we had a good night, enjoyed several beers at the local watering holes and ended our session at The Tequila Barrel \u2013 a good party bar! Overall, we had a terrific stay at the Riu Palace Mexico and would return in a heartbeat. We would recommend it to anybody looking for a bit of class, some good fun and spectacular service in all areas.

Overall, we had a wonderful time. We thought the hotel was beautiful and the rooms were very comfortable and clean. We requested a roll-away and an extra chair for our patio and they arrived very promptly. Even with the roll-away, we did not feel cramped in the room at all.The double beds were firm, but comfortable and my friend who slept on the roll-away had no complaints either. The grounds are very well maintained and gorgeous. The beach is the best of the neighboring hotels and yes, there are sand whales, but they are only there as a result of an act of mother nature. The hotel is trying to preserve the beach from any more damage, can you blame them for that?. The blue water is awesome! The food was great. We did make a reservation for the steak house and had a real nice evening! The buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner never got old. We ate lunch a couple of times at Riu Tequila and and it was also very good (although very similar to the fare at the Palace). The drinks were plentiful and the service was superb at whatever bar you were drinking at. In the courtyard, Pedro and Armondo took very good good care of us- our glasses wrer NEVER empty! We did use room service one evening (just too tired to eat at a restaurant). The menu is very limited. The food arrived fairly quickly, but it was just so-so. The ONLY complaint that I have, is that the pool at the Palace does not have entry/exit steps. It posed a problem for me, as I have arthritic knees. (I witnessed older folks also having a challenging time exiting the water). The only exit available is a ladder, I spent most of my pool time across the street at Riu Tequila. The pool there, had an entrance ramp as well as entry stairs. I would have been very disappointed with the pool situation, but the exchange privileges allowed for an enjoyable pool experience at Tequila.(The pool bar there was also very nice). I also noticed that there were only 2 elevators- both located at the same end of the property. If you get an upper level room, be prepared to do stairs. If you have any disability, make sure you request a ground floor room! Overall, the Riu Palace was a great place to spend a week and well worth the money.

At 1 o'clock in the morning we came up to the front desk to find out where can we get something to eat, and to our surprise we were told that there is no food left on the property of our hotel. We were actually told to go to a neighboring hotel, which also had no food left. The beach is also, so-so. There are no umbrellas or any type of shade at the beach. The only shade that you could get was from the palm trees. And believe me then I say, you can get really burned. There are huge black barriers, preventing sand from washing away from the shore.

The morning buffet was not much to get excited about. The beach is blocked with HUGE, BLACK sand bags that resemble beached whales, which took away from the beautiful ocean view. The shopping town of Playa Del Carmen was like a circus with all the vendors yelling somewhat rude remarks to tourists that did not come into their shops. That is not what Mexico is like. We have been many, many times to Mexico and never seen anything like it. The tourists can keep it. We left 5 days early, rented a car and headed south on our own adventure-with no reservations!

They first said that I couldn't, that I had to bring my own speakers! and finally when they said that they'd provide me with speakers, I was supposed to wrap everything up and send everybody home by 10 PM!!

They also let us have the speakers till 11:30 which was adequate. We ended up getting a private dinner. We had the wedding at the Gazebo. The beach is very crowded with tourists and they haven't partitioned any portions of it for the wedding party. The Gazebo was fantastic though.

The food is extra-ordinary and the hotel is very well-situated well within walking distance or a cheap cab ride to Playa del Carmen.

I was a little dubious not having been to an all inclusive resort before but repetitive this is not. 8 out of the 10 nights that we were there we booked into the a la carte restaurants with absolutely no problems and they were all fantastic. The food in the buffet is pretty much the same every day but there is so much choice you could never get bored. The service is fantastic and the presentation of the food is superb. Every effort really has been made to cater for all possible tastes. Everday for breakfast after visiting the gym (get there early as the equipment is in high demand) we had freshly made juices where you can choose exactly what you want in it, fruit of your choice freshly prepared , omlettes made to order etc etc everything you could possibly want to eat just never enough room for it all. In the evening, sitting around the court yard, the service is exemplary, all staff are so friendly and helpful. It is a very relaxed hotel which is exactly what we were looking for however other guests recommended the Riu Tequila for more lively evenings which is just across the road. We just enjoyed getting quitely inebriated on cocktails whilst enjoying the live music from the bandstand. One night we stayed to watch the show and it was brilliant, they did a mix of shows from Chicago to Grease and it really was so funny and a joy to watch. My partner joined in playing all the activities on offer from Beach Volleyball to shooting and bowls and I enjoyed the Spanish classes on offer. There really is something for everyone. Alternatively you can relax in your hammock under the coconut trees and do nothing at all!!! There is also free use of Kayaks, Pedalos, boats etc etc. The beach does have enormous sandbags but once you get in the sea it is like a bath and so these really don't matter that much plus several people seemed to be really enjoying surfing along them and crashing into the water with shrieks of laughter...! We didn't struggle to find loungers on the beach or by the pool but it was relatively quiet when we were there, however I don't know if this does become a problem in peak season. The only thing I would mention which has nothing to do with the hotel is the taxes at the airport on the return flight.

Overall, we had a great time but I agree with some of the negative comments posted, especially regarding restaurant reservations. I don't understand why you have to stand in line for 1/2 an hour to make a dinner reservation. We only did that one night because our experience in the Bodega restaurant wan't good--I definitely DO NOT recommend it. The buffet food certainly isn't gourmet fare but it would be pretty difficult to go hungry; there are tons of choices with a different theme every night (Italian, Mediterranean, etc.) There was chicken, fish and beef every night with a nice salad bar and several veggies/side dishes to choose from. The breakfast and lunch buffets were really good, although all 6 of us thought it was odd that so much of the fruit (cantaloupe, watermelon, honeydew) was tasteless. We were also disappointed in the beach as our travel agent hadn't warned us about the beach erosion and sand whales. We actually spend more time at the pool then the beach because the beach just wasn't appealing. We didn't have any trouble getting chairs at either the beach or the pool though we had to do a little rearranging to get 6 chairs together. The hotel itself was beautiful, clean and nicely landscaped; the courtyard is gorgeous. It was much quieter than we expected though. There's not much going on at night ( the bars close at midnight) and even during the day, it's pretty subdued. There was live dinner music every night near the buffet--mostly covers of older American musicians like Elvis Presley, the Beatles,etc. We would have preferred more native music-we didn't go to Mexico to listen to Elvis! There was a show most nights-they were just OK-nothing to get too excited about. Our last day we walked over to the Riu Tequila pool area which is adjacent to Riu Palace Mexico. It's a much more casual, fun place. That pool is great--you can sit around the pool and look out at the beautiful turquoise ocean. There was more activity there. We had checked out the disco in the Riu Tequila one night earlier in the week but it was empty and there was a very strong, disgusting smell that some other reviews had mentioned, so we left after a very few minutes. The fridge in the rooms were stocked every day-we had no complaints there. All 6 of us agreed with other reviews posted--the beds are rock hard. Definitely ask Housekeeping for the egg crates as they make a big difference. All of the staff we met were very pleasant and accomodating. The head waiter knew after the first day that we were a group of 6 and went out of his way to get us seated quickly; there aren't a lot of table for groups of more than 4 people. I also agree with the comments about tipping. A few dollars go a long way and from what I saw, the hotel staff work very hard for long hours. The language barrier can be a bit tricky, but the staff really tries to make you happy. The Riu Palace Mexico is a nice hotel if you want a QUIET, relaxing vacation. If you're looking for a little more activity, you will probably be disappointed.

I was a little nervous after reading some of the negative reviews that have been posted on here recently. All I can say is that these people must have been searching for things to complain about. We typically stay at 4-5 star non-AI resorts or couples only AIs but we wanted to stay somewhere family friendly this year. While the rooms, meals and pools aren\u2019t as extravagant as say a JW Marriott, you are also not paying those prices so you shouldn\u2019t expect that! We did go to the Riu Palace Riviera Maya one day. It is newer and the pool is much larger, but it is also a lot busier. We liked the laid back feel of the Riu Palace Mexico. FOOD \u2013 While it is true that the food on the buffet was primarily the same each day, it included pretty much anything you could imagine so unless you ate everything every day I don\u2019t see how you could sick of it. We were skeptical of the reservation restaurants but were pleasantly surprised. I do think the reservation system is odd but we never had to wait longer than 10 minutes to get a spot. BEACH & POOL \u2013 The beach is eroded but there were some good stretches without sand bags. The Riu Palace Mexico had one of the better beaches in the area and they are trying to get it back to normal. There were plenty of chairs in the beach area. I did notice a lot of chair saving at the swim up bar pool, even though there were signs saying it was not allowed. Since we were at the other pool we never had a problem finding a good spot. SERVICE \u2013 This is really what set the resort apart for me. Everyone was so friendly to us, especially to my daughter. The waiters at the pool were constantly checking to see if we needed anything. The front desk staff spoke English and were very helpful. One night our daughter was sick and they let my husband get take-out at the buffet (the room service menu is very limited) and they brought it back to our room. It seemed everyone went out of their way to be helpful and polite. It was disappointing to see how few guests left tips. Even if it says this is included, a dollar here and there really means a lot to these people and they work so hard! I really felt bad for the omelet lady, standing in front of a hot stove in a white coat making omelets all morning. ROOMS \u2013 The rooms are nothing elaborate but were nice and roomy. The beds were strange \u2013 two full beds pushed together. So if you like to sleep next to your spouse you either have to pick a bed or sleep in the crack. The mini bar was stocked daily. Overall this is a very nice resort and we had a great time. I really find it funny when people complain about things like the musty smell \u2013 it is a tropical country and the buildings are open air, I don\u2019t think a resort can control the climate! If you are going on vacation expecting everything to be perfect, you will be disappointed no matter where you go. You\u2019ll probably have a bad experience with a person or meal, just like you would at home. With an AI, they are making food for hundreds of people, so you shouldn\u2019t expect the quality you would at a gourmet restaurant.

We have no problem overlooking minor inconveniences like the stupid method of reserving at the specialty restauraunts. I find that small tips go a long way in boosting the level of your service. I enjoy doing this because I really appreciate the effort the staff is putting forth. Let's face it; we Americans can be hard to impress. Once I was staying at another resort up in Cancun. At breakfast, some jerk flipped out because the grill man broke the yoke of his egg. The poor man was working his butt off and could not understand why the man was irate. The jerk actually went and brought the cook's boss into it. Moments like that cause me to be embarrassed to be noticed as an American. I tipped the cook $5 for doing an excellent job on my omelette. Enough about us being hard to please. Go to Riu Palace Mexico, tip the bartenders, start drinking Don Julio tequila, and make some friends very quickly. The rest will take care of itself.", "Date": "April 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Illinois", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Vacation\u201d", "Author": "dmh72", "ReviewID": "UR14861018", "Content": "We had previously stayed at the Riu Palace in Cancun and had very high expectations. I would say that this wasn't as nice as the Palace in Cancun, but still an excellent resort and much more relaxing than Cancun was. THE GOOD The room was nice (yes the beds are a little hard - ask for the mattress pads they helped a lot), but everything else about them is nice. The food was good (breakfast and lunch were our favorites). We only tried one specialty resturant. The Mexican resturant at the beach was the best for lunch! The booking process for dinner reservations is horrible. We weren't willing to give up beach time to stand in line for 1/2 hour to an hour. The staff is excellent. Very helpful, very attentive, very friendly - I could go on and on. I was a little disappointed to see plates in the hall from room service that weren't picked up for quite some time. The pools were very nice - liked the pool bar, but we spent most of our time on the beach and in the ocean - I can sit in the pool at home! The sand whales on the beach were a little disappointing, but we knew that they would be there. The Palace has one of the nicer beaches and are working on restoring it. There was still plenty of room to sit in the sun or the shade and we never had a problem getting chair. We booked massages on the beach for our last morning - they were wonderful and only $65 for an hour. I would recommend to book early as it was more enjoyable when it was a little cooler, plus not nearly as many people on the beach so it was quieter. We did the Tulum Extreme excursion (Visit Tulum, then rappel, swim in cenote, and zip line). This was lots of fun. Tulum is a beautiful setting on the coast - take your suit, the beach in wonderful and the zip line was fantastic!!!! THE BAD We relying on a 5 star hotel to keep their promise of trying to keep out spring breakers. We had a group of 12-16 teens (with parents) in our wing of the hotel. They were loud and rude until all hours of the night (not sure where their parents were at 3AM, but they didn't seem to be bothered by the yelling and slamming doors). Three nights we had to call security, they did come and take care of the matter, but this certainly was not what we expected. I guess that we expected the parents to be parents. All in all - it was a great trip and I would definitely go back, just not until mid April when the spring breaks were over.", "Date": "April 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island, NY", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing Hotel\u201d", "Author": "TravelGirlLI", "ReviewID": "UR14646342", "Content": "After reading StLouisGirls review I laughed, in complete agreement with many of her issues. Check in for us was fine- no issues there. The resort itself and its grounds were clean and well kept. We didnt happen to notice any, may have just been our luck though. Our main issue was the food and restaurants. Having to wake up early, 830 the latest to be waiting in the bar to make reservations was the worst system I have ever seen. And still arriving at 8:30, we were number 50, not getting the restaurant choices we wanted. Meanwhile, when walking by the restaurant during dinner they were empty. While at the specialty restaurants beverage choices were very limited. Only beer, wine and soda or water were offered. And the wines are NOT reccomended. No bar service at the restaurants was quite annoying. THe buffet was disgusting- food looked like it was sitting there all day! There were never towels available when we needed them. We would either have to wait, or return to the towel hut later in the day. Lounge chairs on the beach and by the pool are very very limited. If you are not there early, forget about it- you will be searching for a while. Many of the staff members did not speak English- understanding we are in Mexico, but we would have at least expected them to understand us when we asked for towels. There is a horrible smell throughout the resort.... THe Mariachi Bar, the hallways and all the bathrooms... On the other hand... the room we had with a view of the courtyard was beautiful. The breakfasts were also the best part of our day. We also took advantage of the spa and booked two massages, one on the beach and one in the spa- both were wonderful. We also visited the Club across the street at the Riu Tequila- my suggestion- dont bother! We also visited teh Riu Palace Riviera Maya- We wished we booked there instead. The pools were nicer and the resort looked more kept up. The lounge chairs were more available and at the restaurant the food looked more fresh. The staff was also much much more attentive.

After reading other reviews I was expecting a luxury resort but was disappointed. I traveled with a large group and we arrived at the hotel around 11 am. After a brief orientation from the manager we were told our rooms would be ready around 3 and we were shown to a hospitality suite where we could change and go to the pool or beach, so far so good. At 3 we returned to the front desk and were told our rooms would not be ready until 4 and finally at 4:30 we got our rooms. The rooms were disgusting. I stayed in a ground floor room with a view of the neighboring resort. It was a decent size but was poorly lit. The couch smelled awful and had some mildew stains and the beds were hard, had stained sheets and reeked of mold. The bathrooms were even worse. However I found out that I was lucky compared to my friends who had cockroaches in their shower and sink. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and I had no problems except for the occasional confusion due to the language barrier. Anytime I needed extra towels or sheets they were delievered to my room within minutes and with a smile. The food was not so great. I had never stayed at an all-inclusive before and I never plan on doing so again. Breakfast was far and away the best meal. There were so many choices and they included freshly made smoothies, fresh fruit, pancakes and mexican specialities. Lunch was so-so and dinner was disgusting. After the first night, I went out to restaurants in Playa del Carmen. Some of my friends who braved the brazillian specialty restaurant and found the food unfit for human consumption. The meat was rubbery and when someone found several dead bugs in the salad bar she was told by the staff to just eat them because they were \"good for her.\" The green beans were apparently still frozen. The drinks were weak and the liquor was diluted. Overall...after 5 days I was ready to come home and was the envy of other members of my group who had booked longer stays.

We spent some time walking around the other RIUs, including Tequila, Yucatan, and Palace Riveria. The guests at the Palaces are a little older-more couples or couples with teens than the others and quieter. For example, Tequila had fun , loud music going on in pool side contests most of the day while the loudest noise at Palace Mexico's pool were the volleyball players. The towel game starts early-towels start popping up at 6:30 and chairs are gone by 9. Even at the beach, the chairs were taken by 10;30. The beach is small but we enjoyed staying up in the partial shade of the palm trees. There is a lot of room up in that area. The beach activities were great -free kayaking and pay per trip parasailing and jet skiing. All of the staff were helpful and friendly-the grounds are perfect-even browned palm tree fronds come down quickly. Pruning shrubs and cleaning takes place early, leaving the courtyard beautiful all day. The food was very good for as many people as they serve. The large buffet had a wide variety of hot and cold foods-6 kinds of smoothies at every meal, including a spinach smoothy. Trays of scrambled eggs as well as custom made fried eggs and omelets every morning, lots of fresh salalds good breads and pastries-I was suprised at the wide variety of foods at each meal. You can make a huge salad of exotic fixings or settle for a hot dog and full plate of french fries-as we watched one teen enjoy one night. The 2 lunch buffets near the beach offer different foods and salads, are close to the beach and worth a visit.The specialty restaurants are average-avoid the steak house-only one third full they night we were there-I can get a better cut of meat at a supermarket. The Japanese restaurant had good saki and wine choices. The gym serves its purpose and they have massage huts along the beach-a special price of $65 each day we were there. The rooms are large, a door then an entry way then another heavy door but even that couldn't muffle the occasional group of drunks returning at 4 a.m. Not many spring breakers but senior trippers-spring breakers with parents along-including one polite group from Colorado who started their trip with Long Island Ice Teas and tequila shots and weren't seen again until late the next day.Overall, a well run, pleasant, enjoyable stay, which leaves you smiling and wishing you had booked for a few more days.", "Date": "March 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cLots of fun\u201d", "Author": "butterflybirds", "ReviewID": "UR14364939", "Content": "We found the resort beautiful and lots of fun.

There is some highlights: HOTEL: The hotel location is great. Near us, we had a little shopping center call Playacar Place. It is very beautiful and luxurious. Also, you have to know that the palace is not really old. There are many big and great fountains all around the place. The hotel is amazing ! SERVICE: You have to know that one of the most impressive thing of this hotel is the quality of the service. When you sit at a table at night, there are always a waiter who ask you if you want something. If you have a problem in your room, call the reception and the service is really fast. Also, the staff of the hotel is very nice. They are always smiling and are doing the best as they can to satisfate you. BEACH: The beach is what it is. The water is incredible, the most beautiful I have ever seen ! The color is clearer than the water of the pool ! Plus, it is really hot. The sand is white and soft. There are some rocks but just in an area, not everywhere. In the water, you can swim without problems : there's no rocks or seaweed. Some people complain about the sandwhale but i found them really funny. You can slide on it and many people here jump and have fun on it. If you walk 3 minutes down right, after the hotels Iberostar and Sandos, the beach is wonderful, without sandwhale. But, there's no chairs down there. At the Riu Palace Mexico, you can always have a chair where you want. The other Riu hotels around can't take our chair. The waiters on the beach are very nice and efficient. You don't wait one hours for a drink ! FOOD: The food, oh my god, the food, i can't say anything about it, WOW ! It's so great that you can compare it to the cruise ship food ! The a la carte restaurants are all amazing. Some people complain about the Bresilian restaurant but i think it was amazing. To the starter to the dessert, all are excellent. The buffet restaurant is really good and there's a lot of choices of meet, fish, dessert, fruits, etc. I can talk about it for hours. ROOM: When i came in my room for the first time, i just say WOW !!! It is really big and beautiful. The bathroom is huge and awesome. If you read a review of this hotel who say : the room is ugly, go right now to the next review. It is very clean. The air conditionner works really well. There's a lot of place to store your clothes. It is amazing ! POOL: The beach is so wonderful, we didn't use the pool often but it's really great and... hot ! It's huge and there's a lot of chairs. Sometimes, we went to the pool before to go to the room, after the beach at 4 pm and there was still free chairs. Again, the staff around the pool is very efficient. You can wait one minute that there's a waiter who want to serve you. My advise: go to the beach, it's so wonderful ! SOME ADVISE: If you want to go to Tulum, don't go with a tour, you'll pay twice as much ! If you want a good way and cheap way to get there, you should use the collectivo. It's like the public bus but don't worry, it's safe ! The ride to Xel-Ha, Xcaret, Tulum or all the interisting thing there, it cost 3 dollars per person. The price to come in the site of Tulum, it's 5 dollars per person. So, if you take a tour, it will cost you 99 dollars per person ! Please, don't waist your money. Xel-Ha is really wonderful. The site is huge and there's a lot of nice activities to do there. I recommand you to go there because it's an all-inclusive (food and drinks) and it's very beautiful. You can swim with dolphins but... it's very very expensive ! Just to stay one day, without dolphins, it's really nice. You can do snorkeling in a natural and huge lagoon. Once again, the snorkeling equipements are include. I prefer Xel-Ha than Xcaret. The ferry to go to Cozumel is... expensive ! We didn't go to the island because it was too expensive !!!

This was our sixth trip to the Caribbean/Mexico region. Our last 2 trips were to Sandals (St. Lucia and Jamaica). We go to moderately priced restaurants weekly and high priced for special occasions. We love to cook and are pretty good at it. Here is our review. The hotel: Location very good. 20 minute walk from town and 5 minutes/$5 cab ride. Small shopping plaza 2 minutes walk-nice and smaller scale of town. The hotel itself is beautiful and clean. The staff is friendly and helpful. Few helpful hints: if you don't like the noise from the stage and fountains, ask for rooms that don't face the inner courtyard. Our room was 3rd floor and very quiet. Bring your cash in $1s and $5s for cabs, tips (not necessary but appreciated) and shopping. Room was large, comfortable and clean. To restock the in-room bar you need to catch the drink guy. We agree with all of the reviews that the beds are very hard. You can ask at reception for a soft topper for the bed. Food: We found the buffet to be of good quality, variety and quantity. There is something for everyone. Don't miss the Mexican section at every eveing meal. There was a regional theme nightly. If you have good Japanese restaurants at home, skip Miyagi. At Sir Edward the food and service was excellent. We did not try the other sit down restaurants. The variety of the buffet was excellent. For breakfast and lunch, you can eat at any of the other 5 Riu hotels in Playacar. Dinners must be eaten at your hotel. the restaurants have 2 sittings; 6:30pm and 8:45pm. You must book daily between 7:30 and 10:30am. We preferred the freedom of the buffet. Pool: Beautiful setting. Very clean. there are 2 sections. The north section has all of the activitiy and the swim-up bar with music. Can be loud. The south section is quiet and relaxing. don't miss the large jaccuzzi on that side. It's hidden behind some bushes. Beach: unfortunately, Mother Nature in the form of hurricanes last fall eroded the beach. It is not as nice and smooth as you would expect . You can still go in the water, sit on the beach and sit under the palm trees. If you want lots of sand and beautiful beach, walk south beyond the next 3 resorts and you will find it.

Lunch was OK, but would get old over a 7 day stay. The dinner buffet was similar to lunch, and we had trouble getting a reservation. By my estimate, they only allow 25% of the guests the ability to get a reservation, and we usually got there late so book right at 8:00 am. We did eat at the Brazilian and it was very good. Overall, the food was very good. Beach All of the beach's took a hit, but this resort seemed to have the best of what was left. We walked down to the Iberostar and were stunned by the loss of beach from 2 years ago. The Palm tree area getting to the beach was very nice to sit in for a break from the sun. Pool OK. A little problem getting a front row chair, so get down early. The pool bar service was again excellent, but the quality of the drinks was poor. Summary This was a grand old property with a great heart. The service was excellent but the rooms HVAC needs to be updated. For those seeking a 5 star resort, you will not be happy. We have stayed at the Excellence, and this property does not compare. I think it is a little overpriced when compared to other options in this area and had a great time, but would not go back simply due to the musty smell.", "Date": "March 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cAbove average, but nothing to write home about....\u201d", "Author": "beechmi", "ReviewID": "UR14011389", "Content": "The Riu Palace Mexico is one of a few large resort hotels in Playa del Carmen and Cancun. It is basically an above average cruise ship on land. The lobby and grounds of the property are impressive and extremely well maintained. The hotel is very clean with friendly resort staff everywhere. The rooms are a nice size with a decent sized bathroom. Rooms facing the central plaza (with balconies) are available for (currently) an extra US$30 per person per night. As with all hotels I have stayed at in Mexico the beds are hard, and not very comfortable. But this is something I have found throughout Mexico (Mexico City, Puerto Vallarta, Cancun, etc.). We had to switch rooms a few times because of a very strong musty 'sewage' odor, and problems with the air conditioning. I discovered that the air conditioning in the rooms on the south wing does not work very well and is very weak. I would avoid this section of the hotel if at all possible. Also, the resort's theater is located near the central 'plaza' and plays loud music until after 11:00 pm. Because all the floors of the resort are tile (with few if any rugs) the noise travels and may keep you up at night. We opted for a room that face away from the theater which seemed to help. The gym is small (and hot!) but functional. The spa is average as are the restaurants with lots of free liquor (although it was hard to find the top notch liquor - Absolut, Tanqueray, etc.). The beach and pool area are clean and we never had trouble locating a chair or spot on the beach even though the resort was full. There isn't much of a beach though, but what is available is nice. One thing I found interesting was that the hotel does not purify their water so it is not potable. How can this property have a 4 star rating from AAA and not have potable water? Its the first property in Mexico I have stayed that did not purify their water. Overall there was nothing major to complain about with this resort but I would not spend a lot of money to stay there.

You can always get a lounge by the beach or the pool. As a matter of fact, I thought it was less populated than last year. (The economy?) I had cappacino two or three times a day, so I don't know what the other reviewer is talking about, and we swam in the ocean every day. One day it was windy and a little rough, but surely you can't blame the hotel for that. Yes, it can be a little tiring eating the buffet food every day, so try the restaurants. The Brazilian was excellent and the Japanese was very good. I was less impressed with the steakhouse, though some people raved about it. Breakfasts were outstanding--anything and everything you could eat from oatmeal, vegetarian platters, to bacon and eggs, pancakes, etc. Mimosas and bloddy mary's every day. You can use all the facilities at any of the Riu hotels, so you can bike ride or go to the sports bar or disco etc at another hotel or even sit at another beach or pool. Last year we walked the whole length of the Playa beachfront and went into every hotel and definately like the Palace de Mexico the best, except for the Iberostar, which is also lovely. We spent a day at Xcaret and loved it--only minutes from the hotel. Beautiful setting, fun to swim in the underground river, and the show was spectacular (a little long).

You had us worried but, as my friend and I always say we could could have a good time on a beach blanket in a parking lot. Of course we live in central IL, USA so leaving snow and ice for 82 and sunny was a treat all its own. The grounds were beautiful. The rooms were spacious and very clean. yes the beds were hard but, who cares we were so tired at the end of the day it didn't matter. I asked our room attendant for extra towels and water and it was given. The wait staff couldn't do enough they were always there asking if you needed anything and we laughed that they constantly were replacing our coasters under our drinks, and wiping off the tables. We had no problems with bugs of any sort!! And if there is a biting bug around it would find me first, we didn't leave our doors open alot maybe that was the problem for some, but we also don't spend much time in our rooms. we took repel and never used it once. The beach is what it is, they can't help the sand whales being there they were not enough of a distraction that i would turn down another trip to the same resort. We loved the sun, sand and the whales made nice loungers in the water. We spendt late afternoons in the pool playing volleyball, met alot of cool people from many places. There were 8 of us all traveling together, 4 couples. 4 of us had been to Mexico before and the other 4 were newbees. The food is not like home but, if it was you wouldn't be in Mexico. We had plenty to eat and our boys are big ones and they like mainly Steak. The steaks are not like the US at all but we raise our own and never expect other meat to be as good. We mainly ate at the buffet nothing to complain about there and like I said our guys are eaters. We ate at Sir Edwards you should go for the experience the food was fun, the salmon was great. The steak there was better than most the men said.Our waitress was so sweet and put up with our men being strange without question. Meaning this was out of their comfort zone, and it was the funniest thing ever. We Took 3 excursions. The Pirate Ship Cruise. Not exactly terrible the lobster was Great, the trip to and from the resorts was long and very tiring. It turned out to be a 71/2 hour trip. wouldn't do it again. One of our ladies went on the Horse riding trip, she said it made her whole vacation, the pictures were beautiful. One couple went on the dolphin trip they loved it.... Expensive for the pictures though because you can't use your own camera, but they said they would do it again. The whole group did the 4x4 jeep trip in cozumel. DO NOT GO!!! this wasted our entire day, you were not allowed to leave the group as we were told and it took up way too much time waiting on others, the end of the trip is the snorkling for like 15 minutes huge huge waste....The ferry ride was nice into cozumel. to do it over we would just take the ferry and do our own thing for the day. We have been to other resorts in Mexico and the Dom. Republic. We have stayed at 2 other resorts in this same area all very similar to compare, Some people must just look for things to complain about. All in all our trip was great the resort is well worth the trip and the money. We would gladly return to the RIU but, our goal is to get different stamps in our passports!!!

It may be a concern for families with small children because there are drop offs and the swimming area isn't the most gentle.

I visited the Riu Palace Mexico in December 2007. I'd heard about the problems with beach erosion and was nervous about it because I love the beach... but I had a great time when I got there! Here's a breakdown: 1. THE BEACH: while it is true that the Riu's beach has eroded, THERE IS A BEACH AREA at the Riu in the direct sun where you can lounge all day, and I never had a problem getting a chair. It's not a huge area, but it's there and I was on it for each of the seven days I was there. There is also a grove of palm trees (and sand) -- I thought of it as the \"palm tree grove\" directly behind the beach proper if you prefer indirect light -- that's where the beach bar is, and it (the palm tree grove) is huge. If you prefer the deserted beach feel, there is no need to drive to another beach... just walk toward the ocean, turn right, and walk six or seven minutes down the beach at the hotel. The resort area ends and there is a big, beautiful beach there -- occupied only by the beachcombers walking back and forth from the resort area. At the hotel, there are also inflatable reefs in the ocean. They are part of the effort to restore the beach, but they were actually fun to play on and to sunbathe on -- it like having docks. The status of the beach should not be a reason for not staying at the Riu: (1) you can still sunbathe and swim at the hotel beach (2) there is a huge beach a short walk away (3) the other things at the hotel are absolutely fantastic and the experience is not worth missing. 2. THE STAFF: The staff at the Riu was great -- and certain members were outstanding -- they knew our names by the third day. I didn't want for anything the entire week I was there. The rooms were exceptionally clean, and they were always cleaning the hall areas. I think the pictures say it all -- there is no way this hotel, or its rooms, could be construed as dirty! 3. FOOD: This was my first all-inclusive and I was nervous -- I'd always heard that the food at all inclusives was terrible. I loved the buffet. It was huge, and each night it had a special feature (along with the enormous amounts of everything else). There is a fresh juice bar at breakfast that has everything: mango juice, papaya juice, etc. I ate at the buffet restaurant by the beach for lunch every day -- a huge variety, and awesome guacamole! I think the specialty restaurants were overrated -- I ate at the Sir Edward (gourmet), and the Brazilian restaurant. They are fun to try, but I don't know how many I would go back to if I went again -- I preferred the buffet. 4. OTHER THINGS: Overall, the Riu is a beautiful hotel -- the pictures really say it all. It's not the place to go if you're looking to do serious partying on vacation or if you're single and looking to meet someone. However, if that's the case, you can cross the street to the Riu's sister hotel, the \"Riu Tequila\" (the food and drink privileges carry over) at night.

As I had contacted the hotel a weel or so before or departure date...our room was filled with beatiful exotic flower arrangements. My wife and I were celebrating our wedding anniversary. The hotel itself is large but not overwhelming. Each piece of art or area of landscaping is thoughtfully placed to provide visual surprises around each turn of the hallway or garden path. yes, it gets slippery when it rains...but hey, you are in the tropics in what is essentially a jungle...its gonna rain. The floors are not so slippery that they present a hazard to guest. The pool area is quiet and relaxing. The hotel animation team seems to focus onthe beach area during the day. We recommend the hidden ten person hot tub just between the pool and the south side of the main building. There is nothing like drinking mojitos and relaxing in warm bubbling water, or lying on the fine sandy beach. Food was not an issue...all was good quality or better. This is not the same style or ingredients used at home...so be adventurous and try something new. The buffet was excellent, for breakfast and dinner. We did not each lunch often as we were busy doing absolutely nothing on the beach at that time of the day. The staff were genuinely friendly and went out of their way to provide guest satisfaction. Don't be rude if a hotel employee does not understand you, they will usually find an employee who can help. The animation team was funny, entertaining and friendly...but they were never pushy as we have found at other all inclusive resorts. Rooms were meticulously cleaned every day. Yes its humid if the doors are left open, yes you may encounter an occassional harmelss insect...but the way I see it, thats what will happen when you pace a resort hotel in the jungle. It didnt ruin our trip, or affect us one bit. Housekeeping kept our mini bar stocked and our firdge full every day. A simple cash tip of one or two dollars per day to the housekeeping staff will ensure you will be treated like royalty. So why be cheap, tip the staff.

Food: The food was very good and our favorite was the Japanese restaurant. Although, we were a bit disappointed that it was not like the usual Japanese restaurants where they cook in front of you it was still very good. The buffet, we felt, was better then the specialty restaurants even though you have to serve yourself. Each night the buffet would have a different theme and the Chinese theme night was excellent. The duck was very moist and out of this world. The breakfast had many options and definitely something for everyone! Our favorite lunch was at the beach restaurant but the problem was trying to find a table to eat. This was always crowded and it was much easier to walk up to the Main buffet for seating but the lunch was more formal then what we wanted. Service: The service in the restaurants and buffet was very good. Always attentive and had our glasses filled as soon as they got low. The service from the front desk was bad. This hotel which is rated 5 stars had only one ice machine and that was located on the first floor. Why they have mini bars in the room and no ice machines on each floor is beyond me. Anyway, the ice machine on the first floor broke after our first day. We then had to call every day around 4:00 pm for ice to be brought to the room from the front desk so we could have a drink on the balcony. We would then wait one hour and have to call back or, after one hour, get a call from the front desk asking if our ice was delivered ok. When we would reply \u201cno\u201d we did not receive ice they would apologize and say \u201ccoming right up\u201d. Just when were ready to leave for dinner around 6:00 the ice would show up! This went on day after day so it was not just an isolated incident. We did get a laugh from this because one day they took our ice bucket and not only did we not get ice but we never received our ice bucket back. Another annoying incident I must complain about was when the cushion from our seat was taken out from under us. We sat on the patio for drinks after the show and were asked for the cushion from under us so they could clean up. Now, if this was a cloth cushion I may think ok but this was a waterproof vinyl cushion which they take in at 12:00 pm and put back out at 8:00 am. Do not think 4 cushions left out would have hurt anything. I don\u2019t want to sound like a complainer but I must also add this. My husband and I wanted a bottle of wine for our room and were told it was not possible. When Daisy came around to our Buffet table and asked if we needed anything we explained to her that we wanted a bottle of wine being our anniversary on the 29th. She said she could arrange it and what time did we want the wine delivered and we said around 4:00 pm. She also said she would also get us dinner reservations for 2 at Sir Edwards to celebrate because it was a special occasion we did not need to wake up at 8:00 am to make them. We never heard back about the dinner reservation and received no confirmation or bottle of wine in the room. My husband had to walk to the Yucatan next door and purchase a bottle for 20.00. Now, the challenge of getting someone to come up with a wine opener was the next task. Room: We had a Jacuzzi suite and our boys had a regular room. Our room had a beautiful layout with a walk in closet that had built in shelves and plenty of hangers. The beds were hard but we had no problem sleeping on them. The Jacuzzi was up on a separate floor of the suite and took at least 45 minutes to fill because if you put on just hot water it comes out very slow. We enjoyed it anyway while sipping our hot drinks (back to the ice machine problem). The tile floor in the rooms did constantly have moisture on them which made it very slippery. I would suggest packing shoes with rubber soles or it could become very slippery. I must say that I am not a fan of the dark wood used in the rooms. When in a tropical place I would prefer to have a light and airy feel and the dark wood made the rooms seem a bit drab and depressing. However, that may just be my thoughts I understand everyone has different taste. The rooms were always very clean and our beds turned down each night which was very nice. Beach: Considering all they lost during the hurricane it was much better then I expected. Yucatan was in bad shape and I would clearly be upset if I was staying there. They had a huge 8 foot drop off. Riu Palace did a great job restoring their beach and had about 4 rows of loungers on the beach on two sides. The sand walkway to the beach under the palm trees also had many loungers. We had no problem getting a lounger even during Christmas week but we did claim them at 8:30 am before breakfast so that could be why. My kids loved the whales (sandbags) in the water so they were not a problem. I think they created quite a fun thing for the teens, adults and kids to play, sit and jump off! I did notice when we arrived on the 27th we had drink service on the beach by the 30th the service stopped. I think it got so crowded with people coming in for the New Year they did not have spare help to walk around with drinks but it was quite nice while it lasted. In closing, we had a wonderful time and found this hotel clean but a bit outdated in places. The food was good especially in the buffet and the beach was still wonderful considering what they went through. Even though we experienced a few problems I always try to keep in mind that with so many different people it is hard to please everyone and small things are bound to happen at every hotel.

It does however need some updating. We didn't start off great - we were left stranded at the Airport by Cancun Limo (not cancun valet) Rooms: a bit tired looking. bathrooms need updating. bring slippers as other reviews have said floors are sticky. We left tips for maids every day and found they just did the minimum.. At the paradisus the maids would scrub the room daily. Bring your own hairdryer - ours was rusted and barely worked. Beds were comfortable but two doubles pushed together. I assumed if you asked for a king they would make it up as one bed. This is not the case. If I was on my honeymoon I would be disappointed. They need to update the room key and safe key to credit card and code system for better security. Food: Our biggest complaint, the food is much better at royal hideaway and iberostar. We avoided AI because of buffets. When they started having specialty restraunts we got on board. Japenese was good but they don't cook in front of you as at other resorts. Others are not very good at all. Buffet is good but I don't like getting up between each course to get my food. The reservation times are 6:30 too early and 9:00 too late. The resort also does not have a wine list. they two kinds to choose from. Lunch at Don Julian is better than the buffet at the beach and you don't have to fight for a table. Bars: Our teenagers enjoyed the disco across the street. we enjoyed sitting outside at the Riu Courtyard Bar. We were actually having a glass of wine with wonderful couple we meet on TripAdvisor. It was about 12:10 the bar closes at 12 and the waiter came over to ask us for our seat cushions. As first we didn't understand what he was saying then he pointed. We were shocked to have the cushions at an outdoor bar taking from underneath us at closing time. Grounds: Beautiful - tile gets very slippery be careful Beach - we all know mother nature took it away, you are on top of eachother, there is room under the palm trees but it not as close to the water. The whales are fun to play on in the water. bring bug spray for night even if you don't see bugs they are around All in all I feel we overpaid for this resort.

I have travelled to many hotels in the world and I must say that this was the best overall hotel I have stayed in. The food is really fantastic - there is such a great range of food and it is all of superb quality - it's really difficult to know what to choose. We didn't go into the specialty restaaurants as they operate a rather daft booking system which means that you have to queue at 8.30am to book your place. As we went diving at 8.00am every morning, we were unable to do this, so that was a bit unfortunate. The staff are all extremely helpful, and friendly and there is always someone around to help whatever you need. The service in the restaurants and bars is fantastic and consistently so. The room was kept very clean, although I do agree there was generally a slight musty smell - however, you must remember that the room is air conditioned and that this part of the world is generally very humid, so it's something that is difficult to avoid. I was not particularly keen that in the general reception and lobby area, this was not a smoke free zone and did come as a bit of a shock, bearing in mind the recent change to smoking laws in the UK, but of course this is a different country so you can't expect the same laws to apply. However, it was never THAT smokey. The grounds are beatifully maintained and there are always people working hard. I didn't feel that you were expected to provide tips, but we did where we found that exceptional service had been given (which was most of the time!) and these were always greatly appreciated. I know that some guests were quite generous in providing tips in the restaurant and staff gave special attention to these people by reserving tables and decorating them with flowers etc. Us Brits don't like to be made a fuss of, in fact I could think of nothing worse than being made a spectacle of in the restaurant, so if you don't want a big fuss, then be warned. I have noticed comments by other members on this page to say that drinks were watered down with inferior brands. I can honestly say that we did not experience this - the optics in the rooms were big brands names such as Smirnoff and Bacardi - can you seriously believe that they would bother putting other brands in the bottle? They were about \u00a35.00 at the airport duty free and I am sure that the hotel would secure bulk buys at much less than this. The beds are quite hard - I suffer from back pain, but I must say that I did not have a particular problem with the bed, despite this. On a more negative note, the erosion of the beach is quite extensive, whilst this is not the fault of the hotel, you should think twice about booking this hotel if you like a pleasant dip in the sea. The dregding activities to restore the beach involve huge sandbags around the beach together with lots of pipes and cables, which quite frankly could be quite dangerous.

We loved it the first time (2004) and were a little anxious to know if it would live up to our wonderful memories and IT DID! The ride from the airport was routine and went very smoothly. Our room was great, although we only received one towel \"animal\" our entire stay, and that was after leaving a tip. We asked for a mattress pad upon check in and that made a huge difference. The room did smell a bit musty, but if you travel in the tropics, that is something that isn't unexpected. The grounds were immaculately manicured and beautiful, especially knowing that all of the trees in the main courtyard had lost their tops in Hurricane Wilma just 2 years ago. We only went to the pool once; it's a little too cold for us. We spent nearly every day on the sand under a palm tree, it was amazing. Yes, the beach is eroded significantly, but neither the Riu or any other resort is responsible, it's called Mother Nature. We watched the Riu employees work to fill very large sandbags every day and hope that those measures will help. If you want a flat beach to walk along, the beach just south of the Riu, by maybe 4 resorts, begins to flatten out and wasn't crowded at all. We also had a massage on the beach, we highly recommend that, very relaxing. The food was fantastic, which we thought was surprising for a buffet. We dined at Don Julian all but one night, when we went to Sir Edwards. We were disappointed with the service at Sir Edwards; it was very slow, however the food was good. I think our favorite meal was breakfast; we would sit and chat for 2-3 hours, enjoying mimosas and cappuccinos. The drinks were great unless your objective was to be drunk by lunchtime every day, which we had no interest in. The service was fantastic!

The check in was quick and very professional. Our room was o.k., though not clean, hairs from the last guests everywhere. The floor was so dirty that I kept my flip flops on all the time. The bed was not very comfortable but ok, still I would expect better from a 5 star hotel. Fresh towels were provided every day, many with ugly spots and most times some towels were missing. The mini bar was not restocked every day (we only had the water and soda, though there was plenty of beer and liquor), only after talking to the assistant director (very nice and helpful), this was resolved. There was always a slightly musty smell in the room (courtyard, 2nd floor) and when we unpacked our suitcases back home, everything smelled really musty. The service in the restaurant, at the lobby bar and at the pool was impeccable and very friendly. Santoyo is great, he is responsible for the service at the terrace section in the buffet restaurant. We only tried the Sir Edwards of all the specialty restaurants and the service there also was very good. The service at lunch time was horrible, especially at the beach restaurants and so was the food. The waiters there were slow and uninterested. Overall we were not so happy with the food. After 3 days we had seen it all and it was just a repetition of minor quality meat (once undercooked chicken!), some vegetables, boring pasta and a boring starter buffet. The calamari and shrimps on the other hand were excellent. There was a Mexican buffet in a corner of the restaurant, but it was the same food every day too. The dinner in the Sir Edwards was of mediocre quality, but it was nice to have it served. The breakfast on the other hand was very good. The drinks and wine were somehow ok. The drinks were watered down and mixed with minor quality liquor, we had to ask to get branded spirits. The juices for the drinks were only some kind of reconstituted stuff. The wine list showed wines (Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot from Chile eg.) that were not offered (\u201csorry, we don\u00b4t have them\u201d), only cheap Portuguese and Spanish wine. Astonishingly the Cab and the Merlot (ok. quality) were offered at the Riviera Maya at the bar \u2013 we could not find out if they offer it in the restaurant too since the Riu policy only allows you to go to the other Riu hotel bars and discos, not the restaurants). We always gave plenty of tip, we liked the service in general and some people did an outstanding job. We would have appreciated the maid not only accepting the tip but doing a better cleaning job. Be careful, the walk ways are very slippery. The beach was almost non existent. They are working on it, but how long will it take? We saw no progress during our stay. We stayed at the pool which was ok and there were enough umbrellas. Internet access was only offered in the lobby and the charge was 8 Dollars/hour or 15 for 24, even when you have your own laptop and just want to use the wireless service. The bandwidth was not great and on top not even stable. One sad thing in the end: our friends left a couple of days earlier than we did and they called us right after finding out that they had left a cell phone in the night stand.

After a minute of checking the deskman, Ron said it was our lucky day. He gave us an awesome room with a great view of the pool area, the fountains and Cozumel\u2019s lights at night.

We booked our trip through itravel2000 and it was a Sunquest package. Sunquest now offers travelers the option to pay for private transportation to and and from the hotel. We thought this was a great option since we would be traveling with a one year old and could go straight to our hotel rather than riding on the bus/shuttle and stopping at several hotels to drop people off on the way to ours. We were supposed to have a suburban but instead were driven in a Chevy Malibu. It was a tight fit for 2 adults and a car seat in the back seat plus fitting in our bags and stroller. However, not such a big deal. It was a big deal though when the car overheated on the highway outside of Playa del Carmen and the driver told us we had to get out. He didn't speak English very well but told us that we'd have to get out and his buddy would pick us up. We were beside ourselves. It was late, very dark and we had a baby with us! Fortunately, his friend pulled up as he was unloading our suitcases from his car and we were driven straight to our hotel. We had the same original driver in the Malibu to go back to the airport and we had no problems. Be aware though that you will most likely be driven in a small car and not what is written on your voucher unless you are traveling with a large group. The hotel was beautiful - I can't say enough. The rooms are large with a sunken living room and a deck. Our deck faced the courtyard and we were close to the pool so we didn't hear the noise from the theatre and terrace at night. We never actually got to go to any shows because we were back in our room at 7:30 every night to put our daughter to bed. We also didn't get to eat at any of the restaurants because our daughter couldn't make the late sittings (early sitting is at 6:30 but meals end around 8:00/8:30) and the buffet at 6:30 was already pushing it. The hotel has a really nice terrace and the bar there serves drinks in the evening. Riu has a new drink menu with martinis and all types of cocktails and the drinks were really good....best margarita I have ever tasted! The piano bar in the lobby is open until 6am and then it re-opens a few hours later. It has a slightly smoky, musty smell and I much preferred the piano bar at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya as it was much larger and has huge windows overlooking the courtyard/pool/ocean. The beach at the Riu Palace Mexico is better than at the Palace Riviera. At the Palace Riviera you are landlocked in front of the hotel because the beach has eroded on both sides. At the Riu Palace Mexico, you can still walk in the direction away from town. I couldn't believe the condition of the beaches - completely changed from our last trip in 2004. The erosion is so bad and Riu doesn' t seem to be doing much at any of its properties. Other hotels have sand-bagged piers but Riu Palace Mexico just had a few sand bags but no piers. When the tide is high, you can't access the beach at all. I've uploaded pictures of the beach in front of Riu Palace Mexico. They are actually losing palm trees as the beach erodes and I think they lost the massage hut at the Yucatan next door. We didn't spend much time on the beach though as our daughter preferred the pool. We also never had any trouble finding an umbrella for shade at the pool - unlike other all-inclusives where you have to stake your territory by 7am. We were able to get an umbrella at any time of day. For those traveling with kids I have to comment on the cribs. I will be writing a letter to Riu to complain. Our crib was falling apart and it had springs which are illegal in Canada as baby's head can get caught between them. The mattress didn't even fit the crib so the springs were exposed on the sides. When the crib was brought to our room, there was a big blanket under the mattress and on top of the mattress. Our daughter refused to sleep in it because it was way too soft but after I pulled out the blankets my husband refused to put her in the crib because it was such a safety hazard. The Sunquest rep brushed it off and told us Mexico's standards were different but it was not acceptable. i would have brought our Pack n Play had I known. I absolutely loved this hotel but I had to rate it 4/5 because the crib totally changed our trip. We weren't able to put our daughter to bed and sit on the deck because we worried about her rolling off the bed (yes, she slept with us all week!) The anxiety of her sleeping with us in our bed changed the tone of the vacation but we still had a great time. I plan on bringing our Pack n Play next time so hopefully Sunquest doesn't nickel dime us and charge us for extra luggage! Aside from our issues with the crib, I highly recommend this hotel - nicest all-inclusive we've ever been too.", "Date": "November 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago area", "Title": "\u201cexcellent service\u201d", "Author": "world_traveler035", "ReviewID": "UR10841826", "Content": "The resort itself was beautiful and clean.

We went with 43 other people. Request a room other than ground floor if you go, this seemed to be the area that smelled the worst. But who is always in their room I asked myself? So I got over it . The food was excellent as Sir Edwards and at the Buffet. I didnt care for the Brazillian steakhouse, we left in the middle of dinner and went to the buffet, which was always great. If you starve to death or die of deydration at this place, its your own fault. There is always someone asking if you need anything. If you want to make reservations at the specialty restaurants, you better be in the theater by 8:00am that morning, or they fill up. I was seriously disappointed by the fact that there is no beach..it is a cliff due to erosion. I enjoy walks along the beach in the morning and at night. Not worth the effort unless you like climbing hills until you get about four resorts down. I am definitly a pool person. The pool was beautiful but we were only able to stay in it one day because it was so cold, and I mean cold. The aerobics staff couldnt even get people in it to do them. I did not understant that at all it was 86 and hot every day. It was almost like they iced it down. We ordered room service a couple of times, the lunch menue is great, everything was good, not much of a dinner menue though..but there is always, again, a great buffet..he entertainment was good, nothing spectacular but enjoyable. Again I cannot emphasize enough on how great the service was, but unfortunately, that would not bring me back. The shopping on 5th avenue is near the resort, 5 minutes and 5 dollars in a cab. Go at night, there is a lot going on in the nightlife. We went deep see fishing while were there, it was great. Also ask about the Dinner sunset cruise (surf and turf) This was the best spent money ever, for about 80.00 a person. Its beatiful and you'll feel like Kings and Queens on one of the top ten beaches in the world. We left at 3:30 and was back by around 10:00.

The food is excellent (which was a priority when looking for hotels, as was the beach). Buffet or choice of 4 restuarants (you have to book for 8.30-10.30am but never fully booked) or buffet (hot and cold) which is just as good and food differs every day and night. Loads of seafood, steaks of all meat varieties, mexican food. Breakfasts were also amazing, eggs to order etc. The quality was spot on, as I have been to all inclusives before where the food is sub standard. The beach was great despite the warnings you get of the small size because of the storm damage (removing a a lot of the sand, thus reducing the size). All of Playa del carmen/Playcar has been effected and the Riu Palace is the best beach front hotel. By the time you read this they will be repairing the beaches anyway. Always enough sun loungers and a beach bar just behind you, where you can go and chill on a hammock if you want to get out of the sun. Service. Unbelievable. The mexicans are very kind people and here they are no exception. As you finish your drink, they are there to give another one. Facilities. All the other Riu hotels are around you or next door and you can use all their facilities. There always activities going on in the day that the staff try and get you to do (air rifle shooting, volleyball, bingo!?, pool aerobics etc). If you fancy a 'club' type atmosphere you can go across to the Riu Tequila that has a 'disco' open until the very early hours. Entertainment Amazing dancers and there is a Micahel Jackson lookalike, who I have to say is impressive (moves not voice, he mimes). They do make an effort and I was pleasantly suprised, as this type of enteratainment is usually poor. Cons There aren't any really.

I know, after reading and reading, why people like or don\u00b4t like the hotel.

I didn\u00b4t like the double beds put together, I prefer a simple king, but I guess is their style....Of course we used one queen at a time. Never used both. When we arrived, we were given a garden view room (what we had paid of course) but my husband asked the bellboy if there was a chance for an upgrade. After a simple phone call to Erwin (the bellboy boss I think), we had to wait till 3 PM, but we got a great room, very close to the beach, looking onto the courtyard. I didn\u00b4t mind the garden view room, specially because it was on the second floor, and we had all the privacy we could get because the only thing that could watch us were trees. But my husband liked the new room on the ground level better, where we had to watch out from walking naked inside cause it was on the people's way to the beach. So again, it depends on what you prefer..... I also think the airconditioner was not working well, cause it was too cold, but there is a chance I didn\u00b4t know how to regulate it, so we didn\u00b4t turn it on and that\u00b4s it. About the towel animals, only got 2 in the 7 days... Don\u00b4t know if it was because they didn\u00b4t like us, or because we woke up later than most of the guests, and it was too late... We will never know.... The food was fine, always plenty to choose from. Everything tasted great. We only tried 3 of the especiality restaurants. The Brazilian, the Stakehouse and the Gourmet. Ate great the 3 times. I know people had problems with the booking, but I don\u00b4t know how that can be improved. The restaurants aren\u00b4t that big. It\u00b4s impossible to fit all the hotel guests inside. So I guess it is the fairest way to everyone to make the booking early in the morning. I particularly been there 2 or 3 times too late, but I didn\u00b4t complain, the buffet is just as good. The desserts kind of dissapointed me, I expected more of a 5 star hotel. But the ice-creams or the chocolate fountain saved me from my sweet desires. The drinks were THE BEST. Amazing. Between Hiram, David, Miguel and Mariely (our favourite 4 bartenders) I never had my hand empty. The Banana Mamas & the Pi\u00f1as Coladas were heaven. The only complain in the matter is that the hotel uses a cheaper kind of Baylies....not the real one, but\u00b4s it is OK, cause we went for the tropical drinks instead..... And last, but not least, the animation. I don\u00b4t know if it is because we are very easy-going people, but we had a great time, all the time. If we weren\u00b4t playing darts, it was bingo, or bochiball, or riffle shooting. Since we were almost the same in each activity, we made lots of friends. And became a big group hanging out together all the time. I want to thank the animation team that made all this possible, in particular Ale, Quique, Cris & Aida. The night shows, weren\u00b4t Las Vegas, but enough entertaining. My favourite was the Mr. Riu contest, but that maybe because my husband won the title.... :) Thanks RIU for the unforgettable time we spent over there!", "Date": "November 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mays Landing, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Palace\u201d", "Author": "NJLynn", "ReviewID": "UR10711229", "Content": "Riu Palace October 29th to Nov. 7th We had a great time at the Palace. The hotel is beautiful and the staff is fantastic. We had no problems at all. Everyone was pleasant and helpful. They could not do enough for you and, in fact, Daisy, the hostess at the restaurant, stopped by our table several times to ask if there was anything we needed in our room or anything at all they could do to make our stay more pleasant! We couldn\u2019t think of a thing! Guests were about 20 t0 25% American, I'd estimate. The rest Europeans, South Americans and a few Canadians. Met lots of nice people, particularly Brits. More children than I expected but it was never a problem. Rooms were great, nice sitting area, lots of drawer space. Maids kept room very clean, turn down service at night. Beds were hard but we slept really well there. Food was great. We preferred the buffet to the ala cartes, never felt that way at any other all-inclusive. You did have to make reservations in the morning but never had more than 8 or 10 people in line and it moved quickly. Five minutes in line tops (at 8:30). I think many ate at the buffet instead. Presentation was lovely, waiters were constantly filling your glass and removing plates. Entertainment was as good as any and better than at some resorts we\u2019ve been to, although we don\u2019t care for the audience participations shows which were about twice a week. The animation team always stopped to say hi. The bands in the gazebo were very good, as was the piano player in the lobby bar. Pool is very nice, never crowded, lots of loungers. Pool wait service was very good. The beach unfortunately washed away before our eyes. I would say 10 feet of beach disappeared while we there and a huge 4 foot drop off appeared, making access to the beach in front of the hotel difficult, we walked to the Yucatan where the drop was a little less. They brought trays of drinks, alcoholic and non-alcoholic to you. Checked out the other Rius but kept coming back to the palace. The Yucatan was nice and had a nice pool. There was quite a bit of topless on the beach if that concerns you (didn\u2019t bother us). We had no problem carrying keys to the room or safe, always have some little bag with us or you can put them in your pocket. We have stayed at the Iberostars (Tucan and Del Mar) , Palladium Grand and Occidental Xcaret and while each hotel has it's own strengths, I must say we found the service, food and rooms here the best we've seen so far.

Three of us stayed for one week and three stayed for two. We were there to celebrate a significant birthday and we were not disappointed. This is an all around good resort. The service is fantastic. From check-in to check out the staff make every effort to make sure you are well taken care of. In the lobby bar you finish one drink and the floor manager is there to take your order for the next. You pull out a cigarette and a waiter suddenly appears out of no where to light it for you. The service in all of the restaurants is great. Speaking of the restaurants, you can hardly believe this is an all inclusive. The food is great by any standard. Sir Edwards is the best restaurant in all of our opinions, but the Japanese is also very good as is the steakhouse. Le Bodega (brazilian) is ok, but you have to be true carnivore with little regard for potatoes and greens. The buffet is also very good, so if you get up too late to reserve your ala carte for the evening, don't despair you will still have a good meal. Keep in mind that men must wear long pants for dinner, even in the buffet. Also, if you have a special occasion they will decorate your table for you in advance. We had our breakfast buffet table done up for the birthday, and also our table at Sir Edwards. The drinks are fabulous. A great selection of top shelf liquor. They have a great martini menu. There are liquor dispensors in your room and the bottles are replaced immediately when getting low. You get four beer per day in the mini bar, but leave a note and a little tip and you will get more. The rooms themselves are very nice. We had a junior suite. It was well appointed and was a good size. The beach was beautiful when we got there. It was big, but it sort of washed away on the last day. There was still plenty of beach to lay on, but it was half its previous size. I think it's a cyclical thing. We did have a couple of mild complaints. The pool is not the best. The layout cuts it into two smaller pools and the pool bar scene wasn't very exciting. However, 5 of us were beach people so it didn't bother us much. If you are looking for a fabulous pool book Riu Palace Mayan Riviera. It appears to have the quality of Palace Mexico with a much nicer pool. Another complaint was the lack of night life. After dinner there was a Mexican band playing in the court yard, but it was basically elevator music. Very boring. Fortunately staying at the palace allows you access to Riu Tequila where we went for some evening entertainment. AS far as tours are concerned, pass on the Apple Chit Chin Etsa (?) tour. The tour itself was ok, but for lunch they pack you into an over crowed barely air conditioned restaurant shoulder to shoulder with people you don't know. This is after walking in 40 degree heat. The bus ride takes most of the day. Do go on the CATAMAYA catamaran. It's four hours of fun and snorkeling. Overall, this was an excellent holiday. It was more expensive than your standard 4 or 5 star, but it was well worth it.

We had emailed the resort twice before arriving requesting a room facing the fountains close to the pool. Our travel agent also emailed the resort. When we arrived we were given a room facing a brick wall on the back of the resort. When we walked into the room it smelled so strongly of cigar smoke and anticeptic/ammonia that it literally brought tears to your eyes! Horrible smell! Then the fan didn't work and the door latch was broken. I immediately went back to the front desk and asked politely if we could have a different room and the lady at the front desk who was less than friendly about it and told me to come back tomorrow. I went back the next morning and they did switch us to a courtyard view room but it was right across from the theater and very noisy in the evenings until 11:00 - which is fine except when you are sick and trying to sleep. Here are the pros and cons of the RIU Palace (IMHO): Rooms - average View - Below average (we looked out at another brick wall all week) Food - Good (except I got so sick on Friday from the food - not alcohol & sun because it started Friday morning and I wasn't drinking the night before - that I had to call the resort doctor by Sat. and get a shot and Cipro). Also - you can only make reservations for the ala carte restaurants for that night and you have to be in line by 8:15 AM which was a pain. Also - they only seat at 6:30 or 9:00 (??). This wasn't convenient at all and so we only ate in the specialty restaurants one time. Beach - great! Best part about the RPM. Very wide and plenty of lounge chairs and shade. Pool - small - the pool is better at the RIU Tequila and Yucatan. Lobby - Beautiful, air conditioned but consistently stinks like a dirty ashtray! Awful smell first thing in the morning - reeks like stale cigar smoke when you walk through on your way to the buffet. Makes a good point for open air lobbys like the Yucatan and Tequila. If you are in any way allergic to cigarette or cigar smoke, do NOT stay here!!!! It seems like everyone everywhere was smoking either cigars or cigarettes. Both of our rooms smelled like stale cigarette smoke even though we requested non-smoking. Bottom line - last year we stayed at the Iberostar Del Mar for about half of what it cost for the RPM. My advice - go to the Iberostar - better service, better rooms, half the cost.", "Date": "October 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cNice Vacation\u201d", "Author": "rm0894", "ReviewID": "UR10424559", "Content": "My experience with this hotel was good.

I preferred the \u00e0 la carte restaurants and my husband preferred the Don Julian restaurant for dinner, but like I said they are all good. Our room was very nice, I would rather have one king sized bed instead of two queen sized beds pushed together. But really for the warm weather two beds probably are more comfortable. The bath room is also very nice, it does need more light in the tub/shower, but that is nit picking. The house keeping service is really good as well, they kept the room clean, always had clean towels, the mini bar was kept stocked and even had turn down service. The hotel and grounds are picture perfect, see included pictures. The pool and pool area are spacious there were plenty of chairs and umbrellas. And for us the best part of all, the beach. They have a huge beach area; I believe it is the largest in the area. They have a large area with palm trees and chaise lounges, then a nice sized open beach. The whole Playa Del Carmen area has had some beach erosion, but it is returning. If want to relax under trees you can, you want to layout in full sun you can, a combination of the two you can. It has areas that are kind of isolated you can be seen but you\u2019ll probably be unnoticed. The Beach bar is convenient, and they did bring drinks to us on a couple of occasions. But plan on going to the beach bar to get you own drinks. While you\u2019re at it plan on frequent trips as the glasses are very small. The shows at night are nice, they are not Vegas quality, but they are entertaining. We did not take advantage of all the activities they had there, we didn\u2019t need to.

This is not an American resort in America, so don\u2019t expect it. Do not be upset when things are different from home. If you are going to travel internationally, then enjoy and try the international experiences. For example topless sun bathing, just try it and do it the first day don\u2019t wait until the last day.

We were truly disappointed. It seemed the management at the resort was trying to make everything very inconvenient. Let me explain: 1) No advance dinner reservations. You have to get in line between 8:30-10am and stand in line to make reservations. Then, all the restaurants might not be open that night. And to make it worse, they only offer 6:30 or 9 oclock seating. I thought I was at a resort, not on a cruise ship. 2) Would be sitting at the pool bar, along with 50 other peole in the pool, and they would close the bar at 5. That is the middle of the day. 3) No wait staff on the beach. You would have to get up and walk 200 yards to get a drink that was served in 6 ounce glasses. By the time you got back to your lounger, it was gone The food was C- at best. Only thing I really enjoyed was the breakfast. It is in the buffet restaurant and they would make made to order omelets, french toast, ect. But besides that, bad. If you need a snack in the afternoon, only palce to get it was the buffet. No beach grill cooking up burgers and fries like most all-inclusive resorts. The staff was just not helpful or friendly. I know that when you book one of these packages that they say all tips included. But I always go with a pocket of 5's and 10's to tip. Only one bartender got a tip. He actually look like he enjoyed his job. The positives of the resort are that they keep the grounds perfect. The beach is also very nice, but quite a long walk from hotel.

It is VERY clean with excellent service. The wait and cleaning staff are very attentive and really want to please you. They were always stopping in to clean the room or re-stock the fridge. I would, however, ask for more alcohol if you see that you're about to be out of something because they don't seem to check the mini-bar. Another thing is to be sure to bring shoes that are easy to walk in because the tile (which is everywhere inside and out) is VERY slippery. We were clinging to each other everywhere we went! It would be wise to get mattress covers also! Beach: The beach was so pretty and spacious. There were more than enough lounge chairs and servers come around often with frozen drinks. If you want something else, there is a beach bar very close. There didn't seem to be a great deal of erosion to the beach, but there are more rocky spots in the water than I expected which can be a little annoying. Overall, very nice! Wedding: We really enjoyed getting married at the RPM. The wedding coordinators were super nice and helpful. It was just the two of us, so it was a very short wedding. We were originally going to have the ceremony on the beach, but there really was no privacy because of the nosy people so we chose the gazebo location.

The weather was not the best as it did rain a lot but we were told that that was very unusual. The beach was fine for us but it is washing away due to all the storms that that sent big waves crashing into the beach. If you are a beach snob that this isn't the place for you. The drinks are very well made for the most part and a $1 tip goes a long way. You can bring your own container for them to fill up with alcohol which I would recommend doing since the glasses they use are so small, The room we stayed was the jacuzzi room and it was wonderful as the jacuzzi is on a second floor which you access via a spiral staircase. The rooms were very clean and we tipped them $5/day. You must eat at Sir Edwards resteraunt, it is gourmet and one of the best meals we have ever had. We also ate at the Brazilian and Japanese resteraunts but they were not very good at all even though others did like it. This place is great for couples and honeymooners but not for kids. We did not go on any of the excursions for we thought they were overpriced but we talked to others who went and they seemed to enjoy them. I recommend you go into town and do some shopping since you can get some pretty good deals but the shop keepers will nag you to death to stop in and buy something. Their is a shopping complex on the resort site but you get more for your money if you go into town. The shopping district is a 20 minute walk from the resort or a $5 cab ride each way. Because of the humidity and the chance for rain everyday I would recommend taking the cab, it is well worth it. We booked the trip through AAA/Apple Vacations and the Apple reps were very available, very friendly and very helpful and answered all our questions and take care of all of our concerns. My only complaint about the hotel is that none of the ice machines worked which was very frustrating since we had to go to the bar to get ice.

This had to be one of my best holidays ever. As soon as i waled into the lobby i was like WOW. It was so beautiful. The chandaliers were amazing. The attention to detail not just in the lobby but in the whole hotel is fantastic including the room which are kept immaculately clean by the maid and also left us a different towel animal most days and i thought the turn down service at night was a nice touch. The rooms also had a seperate seating area which was very handy for having the breakfast roomservice in the morning (which i did a lot) or for the roomservice during the day from 11am-11pm. The service in the bars/restraunts was great. Everyone was genuinely happy to help you and always had a smile on their face the people are lovely. Another great thing i noticed when i was there is that you do not need to be up early to reserve a sun lounger. There is always lots available at either the beach or the pool. Another nice touch here is that you get waiter service at the pool and at the beach which i have to admit made me very lazy but i was on holiday so who cares. I know that some people are still worried about beach erosion but i will let you know now there is nothing to worry about, the beach is beautiful. I stayed at the riu yucatan last year and the year before and admitedly the beach was slightly bigger then but its not lost much and its still lovely and the water is great. For anybody who is trying to decide between the Riu Palace Mexico and the Riu Palace Riviera Maya please go to the Riu Palace Mexico. I did compare them and the Riu Palace Riviera Maya does not have much of a beach also the water is not to good in that area and the Riu Palace Riviera Maya looks cheap and it is further away to the other riu resorts that you can use in playacar. The Riu Palace Mexico looks a lot more classy compared to the Riviera Maya. I would recommend the Riu Palace Mexico to couples, honeymooners and civilized groups of friends (this does not include the young and wild). I would not really recommend it for children or teenagers i didnt see many there although i do no that the did have a mini disco available if there were any childern there. The last thing im going to say is please tip hotel staff (inculding the gardening staff). They do a fantastic job. They work so hard to please you and they do not get paid much. I tipped 5 dollars here and there and they were alwys so pleased they always said than you but it is me who should have been thanking them. All i can say is that this was a fabulous holiday and i will definitely be returning to the Riu Palace Mexico. I will try to add some photos later.

We got there right after the hurricane and nothing was damaged. We loved the hotel it is simply gorgeous. I will concentrate more on the wedding part for all the brides that consider this place for their wedding.. Wedding Expereince: Where do I begin\u2026 I considered this wedding package to be an above average price in comparison to other hotels in Mexico. The day after we got there we had a brief meeting with wedding coordinator. I do not consider myself to be a picky person and was very disappointed with service we received. They totally lied about the fact that we could choose our restaurant for the wedding reception when I booked the wedding, we could only have Le Bodega which is absolutely horrible. The menu at Le Bodega is a joke , they have a salad bar which is self-service and 6 different type of meat which you can\u2019t even order since all they do is go around each person and cut a piece. After much negotiation wedding planner did us a \u201cfavor\u201d and allowed us to have wedding dinner at Buffet restaurant \"Don Julian\". For the wedding dinner they do not give you an exception of timeframe allowable for the dinner which is only and hour and a half. They do not provide any rehearsal direction what so ever, on the wedding day none of the guest knew where each is suppose to be and who goes where. As for me they told me that my maid of honor should walk me down the isle?which of course did not happen. My flowers started to fall apart not even half way through the day. I have paid extra to have a cocktail party with appetizers at the Cuban bar, well when our party arrived nothing was set up. No one around from staff knew anything about the wedding. The wedding coordinator was never there to make sure that everything was ready. After my sister numerous times tried to find out what happed with our appetizers they brought them. No one was serving our party, to get the drinks we had to go downstairs and order it! Some appetizers were missing and when we asked the manager, she replied that I never paid for it! I was speechless and did not want to argue on my wedding day so my hubby took over. After some time she came back apologizing and saying that their supplier had some problems with fulfilling the order. The dinner table decoration consisted ONLY of rose petals, no candles or decorative natural seashells. The cake was very small one tier, since we had a party less than 30 they simply wouldn\u2019t accommodate us for the two tier small cake which I was more than willing to pay extra! Not even once anyone came and asked from wedding staff if everything was fine. Rooms: We got the upgraded room for our wedding package, it was big and beautiful, and the view right on the fountains, but the smell of the room was not very pleasant. We had no problems with bed being too hard. Restaurants: Sir Edward is the best choice; don\u2019t bother with Le Bodega or Miyaki. Entrainment: We enjoyed different shows each night, as well as sports activities tournaments during day time. Customer service: The hotel staff is very friendly and for the most part will do anything to make you happy (besides wedding area) I loved the hotel and would recommend it as a regular vacation spot but not as wedding destination.", "Date": "September 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cMixed feelings\u201d", "Author": "LoveSouth", "ReviewID": "UR8654918", "Content": "We visited the Riu P. Mexico on the week of Aug 26-Sep 02 for our honeymoon. Upon arrival we were welcomed with a drink and our rooms were allocated to us right away, however they were facing a concrete slab. We had previously made requests for an oceanview upgrade which was not honored until the front desk individual tried negotiating minimal tip which still got us a courtyard room, we weren't extremely pleased but carried on with our day. The hotel is fairly huge and has a good spread of resteruants and the premises are very clean and staff otherwise is very helpful. Below are some of the salient points about the hotel: Rooms: OK, but our room was infested with small ant like creatures, however the hotel staff addressed that right away and took care of it for us. All rooms are equipped with a mini bar and a liquor dispenser which is a nice touch. The beds are rock hard and it took me a few days getting used to. Resteraunts: We found the Buffet resteruant \"Don Julian\" to be the best of all, however for those eager to wake up early and make reservations, I highly recommend \"Sir Edward\" as that was somewhat similiar to fine dining. Other resteraunt such as Miyaki and Le Bodega were simply a waste of an appetite as the food was far from authentic and dry. Don Julian often changes thier menu at night times which is a good trade. Lunch times at El Patio were OK which is typical to fast food althought i must say i had some of the best hamburgers ever, really tender. Drinks: Watered down, typical to most mexican resorts although i would have expected RIU to be at par with it's standards and not have them that way. The best drinks are made at the Piano Bar, as everywhere else you would have to request doubles of everything. One thing i would like to compliment is that the hotel has a good selection of wines, which to me and my wife were plentiful. Pool: Not good at all, I have stayed in plenty of resorts throghout mexico's pacific and Atlantic regions and have found Riu;s pool to be really small and wierdly shaped. One side of the pool faces a swim up bar where you can witness most of the traffic and is fairly small, the other side of the pool is completely dead, we didn't find a lot of people in the pools regardless, i guess of the same reason. I like to swim in the pools, rather than lounge and i found this pool to be rather shallow. Although, we visited the nearby Riu's as well and i can say that our pool was the cleanest. Every night the pools are cleaned at our property. Beach: Good, there is a minimal damage but was caused by the hurricane 2 years ago and not the recent Dean Hurricane. The water was gorgeous and plenty of sun loungers. The only drawback is that the hotel is not entirely beachfront as there is a 50 yard walk to the ocean from the pools. I did not understand the concept of a topless beach since it is a family resort with kids around. I would highly recommend Riu to look into that or post signage for that. We don't mind that except i would not recommend bringing kids around unless the Resort does something about it. Entertainment: It was pretty decent with mexican themed shows every night and we loved the entertainment guy; Al who had so much energy and always smiling throught our stay. Since it is a family resort, there isn't much to do there after 6 PM, so i would check out the town of Pl.Del Carmen. Overall Assessment: After a few hicups at the check in, we were well taken care of by the managers at the property especially Rose and Roberto. Our room was decorated nicely with flowers and a bottle of champagne towards the later part of our stay. The staff is very friendly and we kepy tipping although we didn't see many people do that.

If you want a hotel on a lovely beach where you can play in the water, this may be a good choice for you; however, we MUCH preferred our stay last August (2006) at the Los Cabos Riu Palace. It is an exquisite resort with excellent service, all the rooms have a beautiful view of the water and beach from the balcony, and it is less hot and humid than the Yucatan, even in August. We would love to return to the Los Cabos Palace, but would not consider returning to the Riu Palace Mexico. We found it depressing that we rarely saw another guest who looked happy or was smiling. In the outdoor restaurant between the beach and swimming pool, they required you to have on shoes, shorts and a top to enter the restaurant area. They need to relax their dress codes and remember that folks are on vacation and don\u2019t want a bunch of rigid rules. It was very much the opposite atmosphere that we found at the Los Cabos Riu Palace where everyone seemed thrilled to be there, including the staff. The main dining room was almost empty every evening for dinner but they still said men could not wear shorts. Seemed that we were forever being told not to sit there or not to sit here when we entered a restaurant ~ left a very uncomfortable feeling.

Upon our arrival, the first thing we checked was the beach and were very relieved to find a beautiful beach! We could tell it is not what it was last year, but still a great beach and plenty of space/lounge chairs to be comfortable. We were also worried about the \"rock hard\" beds we had read so much about. We had requested a courtyard room, which we did not pay for, and were granted our request along with mattress pads already being placed on our beds. This was a great surprise and we were in a beautiful location in the courtyard. The rooms were very nicely made and no one in our group had anything to complain about. They even paid special attention to the various anniversary and birthdays among our group and left wonderful \"treats\" for us on those days! Most of the staff we dealt with was very pleasant and accommodating. The only staff problem we had was in a few of the bars, there are not enough waitstaff and some nights we had to wait quite a while for our drinks. The two downfalls of this upscale resort are; the towel card situation, and the fact that there are no beach waiters. When you pay this amount of money, you should not have to worry about a towel! They should provide plush towels each day by the beach/pool. Which plenty of other resorts are able to do. Also, they should have waiters down on the beach to bring cocktails while you are relaxing. After all, isn't that what this place is supposed to be about? Relaxing? All in all, this is a beautiful resort, very well kept and we enjoyed our stay!

Pool - I have to admit, in both my stays here I have not once stepped in the pools. I don't understand going to the beach to hang out at the pool unless you have kids. Beach - The beach is definitely significantly smaller than it was in 2003. That said, this is clearly a problem for all of Playa. I would say that the beach at the Riu Palace Mexico is as big or bigger than all other hotels in Playacar that I could tell from walking.

Most of the place is tiled and caution is needed. Walking on grass is safer. Take a trip in to Playa del Carmen....nice little seaside town. Cab fare should be no more than $5 each way. If paid in dollars, no tip needed as you pay a little more anyway. Pool is nice but a little on the small side and closed after 8:30 PM. Evening entertainment was fun and the hotel staff appearing in and running the activities program were delightful.", "Date": "August 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cJust an all around great place!\u201d", "Author": "dwninit71", "ReviewID": "UR8379744", "Content": "Stayed at the RIU with my girlfriend from 7/28 to 8/3 of 2007. Just a forwarning...I would highly recommend booking an Apple or Funjet bus to transfer from Cancun to Playa Del Carmen. There is only one taxi stand there with their own cabs (Gray Cabs). We paid 80 bucks for a cab to Playa Del Carmen, but only 50 bucks back so take this into consideration. Now on to the good stuff....We arrived around 5pm on a Saturday to be greeted at the front desk with a nice drink and a lot of informatoin on how the hotel was laid out and when things were opened and closed. The front desk did a great job throughout the trip and always had a smile on their face. The rooms are very nice and spacious. Yes the bed is somewhat hard, but we still slept well. The room is stacked with liqour so you can definitely drink in the room. We barely used the room alcohol because what is the point of staying in the room when you have bars, beaches, and pools to enjoy! The pool is a tad small, but nonetheless we never had a problem getting beach chairs and was very easy to get drinks from the pool bar or by waitstaff taking your drink order. You can ask for a \"double\" if you want more alcohol in your drinks and be sure to request the top shelf stuff or you will just get well. Also...very important...tip the bartenders and waitstaff...these people are running around in 100+ degree heat for you so it is the right thing to do. 5 bucks here or there will bring a huge smile on someone's face and will make their day. The beach was another pleasant surprise. I heard a lot of negative thing about the beach, but it seemed to be in good shape when we were there. Yes there is a bit of erosion, but the beach area is quite deep at this hotel. When you get to the water there is a little drop off, but nothing to even think about. I have attached some pics so be sure to take a look! The water was crystal blue and very warm. The sand was great..pretty fine with no rocks so you don't have to wear anything on your feet when on the sand or in the water. On to the food...my girlfriend and I love the buffets. I mean there was so much variety if there was something you didn't like I am sure you could find something you will. We are from San Francisco so we eat at some super highend restaurants so we know our food. The food is definitely more than adequate and you will enjoy it. The breakfasts usually had waffles, pancakes, eggs (scrambled and fried), bacon, sausage, fruit, etc. The lunch usually switched their main food but usually had some fish, beef, lunch meat, salad, fruit, pizza, pasta, etc. For dinner we usually ate at one of the 4 restaurants on the premises. At 8:30am you need ot be in a small queue of people to get your reservation for that night. No what...I enjoyed getting up that early so I could start get the most out of it. The line only took about 5 minutes max and that was it. The restaurants each had a theme: Sir Edward: Got a really nice steak here with a cheese dressing on top. Very tasty with a bottle of red they provided. Miyagi: Asian/Sushi place. The food was good, but don't expect a full blow sushi spread. The sake is average grade so be sure to drink it hot. We blew through around 4 large sakes so they are not afraid to give you as much as you want. El Patio: This place has some really nice steaks! Be aware it is outside by the pool/beach so there were mosquitos buzzing around a bit. Brazilian: Can't remember the name but if you have a big appetite this is the place for you. Please note that men do need to wear long pants at these dinners and in the buffet at night so bring one or two pair. I think I saw people wearing jeans so they aren't too picky, but I just brough a pair of khakis which was more than enough. The bars have a wide selection of drinks from martinis, mojitos, cuba libres, etc. The only beer on the premises is Corona, but that is what I would normally drink in a tropical environment anyways. In all if you want a place that with beautiful grounds, beautiful rooms, super nice people and friendly service, then this is a place I would definitely recommend. We will definitely be back since we never left the premises the whole week!

After reading some of the reviews prior to departing I was a little worried, as our travel agent had changed our hotel from the Iberostar Tucan at the last moment. We needent of been worried, even though it was peak season, the service was absolutely 1st class, with everyone trying, and succeeding to cater to our every wish. All 4 of our rooms were excerllent with the requested courtyard view being granted on 3 out of the 4. (The occupents of the 4th room prefered the \"garden view\" so we didnt request a change, although we felt that if we did we would of been moved.) The food in the buffet resturant was good and didnt suffer from too much repeating. We also tried the Al-A- Cart resturants which were of very good quality. (You must be prepared to get up and book early though, especially if you want the later sitting. Most places are gone by 9.30 AM). The pool was livley enough during the day, with the Ammination team doing their best to get people involved in volleyball, aerobics, rifle shooting, dance lessons etc etc. They were not pushy if you just wanted to be a \"watcher\" though. The beach was fab, plenty of sunloungers, with no need to resereve early. The water sports team was very good, we used the sailing and windsurfers on many ocasions with the guys being very helpful. A special thanks to \"Tony\" who always made us laugh as he took our continuing orders in the bar each night, (thanks Chicken!!!!), and to Emanual the head bell boy who, it seems was always on duty with a \"welcome home\" when we came back through the door.

We went last year in May and had such a great time we booked again as soon as we returned. home We knew that they would have to give the place a lick of paint as it was looking a little tired last year, and they appear to have done this recently. I know I'm being picky now but it's a little slap dash and not very neat, this really makes the place look a little messy. For example, they've painted the restaurant near the beach, and paint has dripped onto the floor and over the blinds. It wouldn't have taken long to just do a neat job and make it look special. The pool area is now looking very tired, with broken tiles, faulty umbrellas and tatty towels. The popcorn machine (that was there last year) has broken and they didn't replace it. We emailed the hotel several times in advance of our arrival asking for a courtyard room, and upon arrival nobody knew anything of our request. I was disappointed as a repeat customer they didn't acknowledge our request. After a while, they managed to find a court yard view room and we were very happy with the room. The bathroom could have done with a bit of a scrub, there's lots of mould around the bath / shower and the paint-work wasn't very good (sorry to be picky again). The lock on the door was broken. The fridge was stocked with all the usual favourites and the optics were topped up. Beds were hard. Very hard. A quick call to reception solved this problem with the mattress covers and sleep was once again possible. The chairs on the balcony were broken, but again a quick call to reception fixed this. Our first week was wonderful. The food is fabulous, the staff are wonderful and we ate in the buffet each night. Each night has a different theme and there's a massive selection of food. I was happy to eat at the buffet each night, but we tried a couple of the restaurants too. They were also very good. We were worried about the beach erosion, but it appears the hotel has done something as you can walk down to the water. There's plenty of sun beds available, some under the palm trees and some on the beach. The pool area also has ample sun beds. The second week wasn't so good though. I think it was the start of school holidays as the hotel was transformed from a quiet relaxing place with all the guests feeling 'special' to a hotel pushed to the limits with staff working at full capacity. In the first week, a guest in the buffet area dropped a plate. Within seconds the staff were cleaning up the mess. In the second week, it took over 5 minutes for someone to sort out a broken glass in the middle of the buffet area. The guest had to push the broken plate to one side to avoid other guests being injured. Finding a clean table was a problem. On our last night we were given a dirty table with dirty napkins. Not something you'd expect from what should be one of RIU's flagship hotels. Finding a clean table at breakfast was also a problem in the second week. They have a strict dress code in the buffet during the evening, I presume this is to keep standards and ensure it remains a quality buffet and not a free-for-all cafeteria. Nobody was enforcing the rules during the second week, so instead of going for a nice meal it was a case of grabbing the cleanest table you can find, getting your food and getting out. Not ideal when you consider the cost of staying here. Overall I'd consider our holiday experience good, but standards have slipped since our last visit. We took a walk to the newer Palace just down the road, and naturally it's more impressive because it's new, perhaps we would consider staying there next time. Would we go again? Probably not. It's looking tired now, and they've proved how they struggle to cope with numbers. If they do a complete overhaul in a couple of year, I would go back, but I can't help but feel guests are treated to a sample of what was once a truly magnificent hotel.", "Date": "July 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cFantastic place, clean and luxurious\u201d", "Author": "legallyblondeleo", "ReviewID": "UR8138756", "Content": "Fantastic stay for many reasons: -great food, even at the buffet if you couldn't get a reservation at a side restaurant -so close to the beach, which really did have tons of chairs and hammocks open at almost all times of day -bars everywhere you went, even by the pool which also had nachos -rooms were gorgeous and made up twice a day -PLENTY of activities to do within the resort and nearby -fun clubs nearby contradictions of reviews I read before we went: - food was NOT bad.. really it was stunning, even in buffet.. people must be really picky about food because there were a few different things to try but if you go on vacation to a different country like we did, we expected it.

We've stayed at a lot of all-inclusives and this was the 2nd best one (ist was the Grand Lido Sans Souci, Jamaica) we've encountered. Grounds-flawless and beautiful Beach-THERE IS A BEACH. I'm puzzled by the reviews who say there isn't one. Yes, it's smaller than in the brochure pictures, but there's lots of white sand, palm trees, and loungers. We went parasailing and could see all the resorts' beaches and the Riu Palace had the best, by far. Dining-lots of variety at the buffet. The Steakhouse does not have a/c (it's outdoors) so it can be a little warm. The dress code in the buffet is a bit silly---men have to wear long pants but ratty jeans will suffice and the women can wear tanks and skimpy shorts. My hubby didn't think it was fair but it wasn't a major concern. We actually had some fun laughing at how poorly dressed some of the diners were, despite their long pants. Rooms-we were disappointed we didn't have a room overlooking the courtyard, but otherwise it was fine. The beds were hard but didn't bother me and we never asked for a mattress pad. Fridge was stocked everyday and the cleaning was amazing. They even move the beds (every time they clean) and the nightly turndown service was a nice extra. Excursions-we parasailed (available right on the beach) and it was awesome. My husband did the free scuba lesson in the pool then booked the extended lesson and 2 45 minute dives on a coral reef, which he loved. We did a full day at XEL HA, which is very cool. It's a long day to be snorkeling though, so bring a book and relax in one of the many hammocks, beach chairs or loungers. I'm pretty sure I picked upa little food poisoning from the burger I had there which might be keeping me fom raving about the place as much as a I should. Tulum was interesting and the swimming there was a blast. Staff-incredibly friendly, especially the gentleman at the front entrance The only complaint we really had was that we thought the RIU Palace was more of an adults (although not adult only) resort. The stroller brigade was there, perhaps not in full force, but enough that it was disappointing. That is the only reason I did not award 5/5 stars.

I also dont do my reviews after the initial \"high\" of returning from my trip, I wait a bit to review them honestly. Hopefully you'll find my Riu review helpful. Please also see my review for the CATALONIA RIVERIA MAYA, in Puerto Adventuras. As this was a great experience too. I went with two groups of families. The Riu Palace Mexico is a great all inclusive resort. It has a solid location just 5 minutes south of Downtown Playa Del Carmen. The following is the breakdown. First Impressions: Getting to the resort is easy if you have transportation set up. We did through our travel agent, otherwise set it up ahead of time, as personal taxis can be very hard to get and you will wait for a while. The resort is in a chain of RIU resorts being RIU Tequila, Yucatan, etc. Although the Riu Palace Mexico has what I felt the best location and greens/enviroment. There is a big driveway and there is a friendly gentleman to greet you and open the door for you. The staff was very accomidating and spoke very good english at the front desk. If you stay at One RIU you get access to all of them so that is nice if you want to walk around. There is shopping at little shops across the street and Playa del Carmen is only a $5, 5 Min Cab ride into the city. (Warning: some of the cabbies are crazy drivers, be ready for different traffic rules) The resort overall: This resort is manicured like a quality golf course. The greenspace and center pools are immaculate. Every day sand is brushed from the tile walkways and trees maintainted. The beach area is kept very clean and the pools are also. Inside the main hallway is a pretty grand chandlier (spelling?) and walkway. Overall it's appearance is beautiful. Every night in the center plaza there is music or a show of some sort. Whih is nice. There are events earlier in the evening for young children, and shows and music later on geared more towards family and adults. The bar staff services the plaza and getting drinks is no problem.Thier entertainment team is at the resort all day, much like the Catalonia, and they do a good job keeping things fun and the shows entertaining. Beach / Pools: OK the beach is (or was) eroding. If expect Virgin Islands like mile long, hundred feet wide white sand they dont have it. There was a good 3-4 foot drop off along the tree line leading to the water. The water area itself is great, not rocky at all and crystal blue clear when it not that wavy. That being said the resort actually has a great beach area to lay down! Slightly back from the shoreline there are Lots of large palms and hammocks to chill in and just read a book and jam some music w/ the iPod. You can get plenty of sun or shade just pick your spot, of which there are plenty of chairs and spots. Despite the beach drop off, i never felt that inconvienced. POOLS: are great. The staff checks the chemicals several times a day and the waters refreshing. The swim up bars have good service and the volleyball net is always active with fun people or staff. Staff aerobics in the morning, kids activities poolside, and scuba inscruction are the norm, but they still dont feel too busy. Bars/Food: This resort has several restraunts and buffets. Each restraunt has very good food by most American/European standards. Even the Asian place has decent food (although it's not Hibachi). We never got sick and always left satisfied. Make your reservations early though, as they do fill up in the morning. The bars are pretty good. Decent selection of semi-preimum boozes like Smirnoff, Beefeater, Bacardi, etc. The drinks get watered down a bit who really cares when thier free. The bar in our room is not a mini, it's a full size liqor cabinet with 4 bottles and a fridge filled with bottled water, soda, and Corona! This was sooooo nice to have, especially the water. The morning buffet has hot and cold breakfast with a wide selection of smoothie flavors and blended drinks. NOTE! Men need to wear long pants to dinner. For some strange reason women do not have a dress code (no swimwear perhaps) but the men do. SO bring some jeans or slacks men. The Disco over at RIU Tequila was pretty crazy, filled with young teens and honelstly I expected more. The disco at Catalonia was soo awesome that i guess this just wasn't the same. Still, we spent some time there and it was ok. Rooms: The rooms are junior suites with 2 beds and a coutch (some w/ sleepers). They are clean with enough space for stuff, although the beds are hard (welcome to mexico, as this is typical). We left a small tip of 10 pesos ($1 US) and we were stocked with towles. Although one day my girlfriend accidently left 150 pesos in the tip envelope on Easter and we were welcomed later by a towel art zoo of elephants, bunnies, and swans. Room service is very good. Staff: The service here really is first class and I think this resorts best feature. Everyone you encounter has a smile and is there to serve you. The waiters speedwalk to fetch your orders and never keep you waiting. If you are a beach person, they have a beach bar and usually one or two people serving on the beach, although most of the time you have to go to the bar. I never had a problem w/ this. The entertainment team is pretty good, doing activities during the day and shows at night. BIG THANKS TO BAR MANAGER TONY. One night I lift my $$$ digital camera at the bar and I thought for sure it was stolen. Tony had reported it to the front desk and I claimed it the next day. This was really a nice thing to do. Also although not necissarily part of the resort i think, LEWIS from Scuba Caribe teaching the scuba class in the pool was Awesome! If you want great service, this is a good resort to go to. Final Thoughts and Comparison: This resort is a classy place that shines on service. It's a larger resort with lots of choices and is close to playa del carmen. Compared to the CATALONIA the RIU PALACE MEXICO is not necissarily better but different. I would say the RIU has better service overall and more bars/restraunts but has a \"Big resort\" feel and look to it. It is a great place for families or groups. The Catalonia is a bit more romantic, has a better beach and oceanfront, and the entertainment team is outstanding. THe RIU costs a little more but I can see where the money goes as it is kept up so nice and they have great service staff. It has a decent value for what you get. Overall this resort is a great place I would recommend for people who want to be pampered and chill at a resort for a week or two or for families. For someone who is looking for a party atmosphere look at RIU Tequila or the Cancun hotel zone. For a more romantic and smaller resort experince in sand n sun try the Catalonia Riveria Maya further south. I cant wait to go back, Iberostar next?

The Resort itself is very beautiful and immaculate. Food was very enjoyable and rooms were comfortable. We especially enjoyed sitting in the courtyard and enjoying music and shows in the evening when weather permitted and enjoyed the piano bar upstairs when the weather did not cooperate. I have to address the beach which according to most reviews here was described as beautiful. The beach under the palm trees is in fact very nice, however the week that we were there the erosion was especially bad. My husband and I were standing at the edge of at least a six foot high embankement which ran the entire length of the Palace's resort. We were commenting on the loss of beach when the palm tree next to us fell over into the water. No one was swimming in this area when we were there and there was no access on this particular property that week. Yes, there was access from next door, where the guests of the Riu Playacar and Riu Tequila also shared the space. I have mobility issues due to some nerve damage in my ankles and have interstitial lung disease. The extra walking in the heavy sand and going up and down the embankments was very difficult for me. What I looked forward to as a relaxing vacation became a more difficult workout than I had planned. I do understand that nature is responsible for the erosion but the pictures displayed on the Riu website are certainly outdated. We took our concerns to Riu who gave us a response that this was normal seasonal conditions which is a bunch of rubbish. I have stayed at Playacar before and unfortunately due to what I refer to as severe erosion, we will not be back. As for Riu I was very disappointed in their response to my concerns. I paid for a beach in front of my resort. Riu Playacar and Riu Tequila were both cheaper and I find it interesting that Riu has offered guests of the Tequila opportunities to stay at the Riu Playacar Mexico for no additional costs. For the person able and fit, this is a lovely resort.

Originally booked the Tequila for all 8 days, but while we were there the hotel offered us our last 2 days to be spent at the RIU Palace Mexico. Not sure why they did this, there was no \"catch\" to it. The Palace was absolutely wonderful and so picture perfect...as I am a photo nut! If we had it to do over, we would have stayed at the Palace and paid the extra money. My husband and I traveled with our two sons 17 & 10 yrs old. The room: Wonderful, nice extra living room area that we didn't have at the Tequila The surroundings at the resort...if you want absolutely stunning surroundings go to the palace. It was easy to get a shaded umbrella spot there even early in the afternoon. The beach..beautiful...beautiful. I would feel a bit more comfortable with the older ones going to the beach alone from the palace since it is very close, rather than the tequila....that way you can easily check on them. The beach in front of the palace is nice and sandy. If you stay at the palace waiters come around the beach with drinks for you and you can use the hammocks on the beach also. The shows...only one we saw was Michael Jackson and it was good. we were so wiped out by 9:30 we went to bed early every day and couldn't stay up late enough to watch the shows. The Food....VERY good at both resorts! Palace has a bit more elegance about it, but couldn't complain about either. The buffet has a nice variety and we didn't bother going to any other specialty restaurants at either resort. None of us got diarhhea or sick at all. The kids loved the ice cream at lunch and dinner and I loved the chocolate dipped marshmallows (yum) If you come back without gaining weight....you are certainly better than we are :o) Excursions....we did the snorkeling adventure at Maroma beach through apple vacations/lomas travel and it was very nice although it was too windy to do the spinnaker so we didn't get that part. We went to Xel-ha and the kids really liked it...especially the jumping off the cliff which they did like 50 times. We also went parasailing at the beach which was awsome...I thought it would be scary but it wasn't at all. My youngest son was afraid to go but came back with a huge smile and was fine going with my older son....they loved it. One other thing....we noted that there were more travelers from USA at the Palace (seemed to be the majority) where at the Tequila we were more in the minority it seemed.

We had a wonderful time for the most part and I would like to provide you with some information from our trip. FOOD-Overall pretty good. If you are looking for gourmet, big-city dining than you will not find it here. The food is good, but not what I would consider gourmet, so if you are very snobby about your food this may be a problem. If all you need is some good quality hot food then you will have no problems. One thing we found is that a lot of the food is deep fried, which is a problem for a lot of people. We felt breakfast was the best meal consistently. Also, we ate at the japanese restaurant once and the steakhouse twice. Not a huge fan of the japanese place but the steakhouse was very good. The buffet dining room was also pretty good with theme nights every night. DRINKS-You can have them as weak or as strong as you like, you just have to ask. If you do not ask then you will receive the standard weak one shot drink. The bartenders are very friendly and will accomodate your any request. Drinks are brought to you on the beach as well as the pool. SERVICE-Outstanding. Twice daily maid service. Everyone is very accomodating. Waiters, bartenders, etc. very, very nice. ROOM-We had a regular room with no view of anything other than the roof of the theater, but not a problem. The beds are two doubles pushed together and they are HARD, no messing around. We slept allright but they are HARD. A limited number of mattress pads are available, but we were unable to get any. Otherwise the room was clean as was the bathroom. BEACH-The beach is eroded away in comparison to previous pictures I saw, but overall it isnt that bad. You have access to the ocean and many beach chairs are available on the beach and even near the water. Some hotels north of ours had practically no usable beach. The water seemed clean and very warm. MISC-Lots of daily activities throughout the resort. Some nightly entertainment, but it ends at 11pm. If you are into clubs and dancing late into the night you will have to go to another resort or into Playa, because it isnt here. Check in and check out were pain free. We had no real problems to speak of. We are very easy to please people. Booze, beach, and books is just fine for us, but if you are very picky about things then you will find things to pick at here.

I had done exhaustive Internet research, including reading countless TripAdvisor reviews, before booking the resort. I\u2019m happy to report that it met all my expectations \u2013 and then some. In selecting a resort, we wanted an all-inclusive that met this criteria: classy accommodations with excellent service; good food served in an air conditioned environment; a beautiful beach on clear, turquoise water; a location near Playa del Carmen, but not right in town and a resort with an adult atmosphere, rather than one which catered to kids and teens. The RPM satisfied all of the above criteria, including a lovely beach (described below) despite the erosion at this resort and in much of the Playacar properties. We did like Playacar very much, because of it being a gated resort community with restricted access, so guests are not harassed by beach vendors at these resorts. It is also very pretty, with tree-lined sidewalks and a shopping center in an upscale atmosphere. At the Palace, you are treated like honored guests and you want for nothing. The service is exceptional, and the staff, from waiters to housekeepers, greet you with a warm smile and a gentle \u201chola\u201d wherever you go. They truly go the extra mile to serve their guests and to keep the entire resort spotless and perfectly manicured CHECK-IN: We arrived around 1:00 p.m. and were greeted at the door by the gregarious Manuel, who extended a warm welcome, before whisking away our luggage. The welcoming continued at the front desk, where we were given refreshing drinks and useful information. Our room was ready and our luggage was transported immediately. ROOM: Our room was a courtyard suite (which I recommend), with a balcony overlooking the fountains. It was clean, spacious and attractively furnished. I did not notice a musty smell, but I did note some signs of mold around the bathroom tiles. It is, after all, an extremely humid climate. The rooms contain a mini-bar with 4 premium liquors cased in dispensers. A fridge is stocked with bottled water, soft drinks, beer and mixers. All are replenished daily. The room also is equipped with an iron, blow drier, shower/bath combination and bidet. The A/C worked well, and each room has its own thermostat. GROUNDS: The grounds are beautifully adorned with fountains, reflecting pools, palms, shrubs and flowers. One word of caution: Throughout the resort, both inside and out, there are tile walkways that can be very slick when wet or even damp, which is most of the time. BEDS: The beds are two doubles pushed together (but made up separately) to make a king. The mattresses are hard, as reported. However, we asked for mattress pads shortly after arrival and by the time we returned from the beach to our rooms, our beds had been remade with the pads. They made a great difference and we slept well all week. BEACH: The beach, in my opinion, was lovely, even with the erosion. The upper beach is very deep with rows and rows of beautiful palms. We found loungers under the palms at all times of the day, so shade is abundant. The lower beach leading into the water (below the drop off) is wide enough in places to accommodate a couple of rows of loungers, which are all in the sun. There is a sloped area from upper to lower beach for easy access to the ocean. The whole setting was just beautiful and the Caribbean waters are a resplendent aqua in front of this and neighboring resorts. You can walk along the beach going south for a great distance. POOL: The pool is pretty, but not spectacular. It encircles the bar and has a quite side and a more active side. One side of the bar is a swim-up, the other side a walk-up. There are plenty of loungers available at any hour of the day. FOOD: The food is certainly plentiful and the quality is mediocre to good. Breakfasts, which we ate every day on the beautiful outdoor terrace, are outstanding. We ate at the specialty restaurants for dinner 3 times \u2013 twice at the \u201cgourmet\u201d restaurant, Sir Edward\u2019s, and once at the Brazilian restaurant. Sir Edwards was the better of the two. Reservations must be made in the morning for that evening, and seating times are 6:30 pm and 9:00 pm. We really didn\u2019t find the reservation system cumbersome at all. We simply appeared downstairs at the theater at 8:30 am on our way to breakfast, got in a short line and within minutes had our dinner reservation. Reservations may be made anytime from 8:30 am to 10:30 am, but your chances of getting the time you want are better if you go early. No reservations are necessary for the buffet (Don Julian\u2019s). DRESS CODE FOR DINNER: Men must wear long pants, shirts with collars and closed toed shoes at the specialty restaurants and Don Julian\u2019s for dinner. This doesn\u2019t mean that guests need to \u201cdress up\u201d for dinner, however. A pair of khaki pants, a knit shirt and penny loafers, for example, will suffice. Women may wear slacks or dresses, and can wear any kind of shoes they want. DRINKS: What can I say \u2013 your glass is bottomless! All the bars at the hotel and on the beach provide excellent service. Premium liquor is available, but you have to request it. The drinks can be a bit weak, but you can also request that they be made stronger. All the staff is very accommodating. TIPS: Tipping isn\u2019t required and is supposedly included (at a rate of 15%), but we tipped for most everything \u2013 from the doorman to the housekeepers to the waiters and bartenders. After all, service was not just average but exceptional, and at home we would certainly tip more than 15% for outstanding service. SHOWS: There was live music provided by local and regional bands every night in the courtyard patio. We enjoyed sitting outside and having drinks before dinner and then coming back after dinner to listen to the music and have more drinks. The theater had a show every night that was a Broadway-type dance revue with lip-sync. The dancers were quite good and the Michael Jackson (impersonator) show was especially fun. Everything shuts down at 11:00 pm and the resort becomes very quiet. Those wanting more action may go across the street to the RIU Tequila, which has a disco bar. The only negative all week was the cigarette smoke we encountered in the bars and outdoor terrace. Thankfully, smoking isn\u2019t permitted in the restaurants (except, perhaps, the open air one at the beach). I feel certain this is not unique to this resort, but it did keep us from using the lobby bar or spending much time in the theater. All in all, this is an incredible resort and an excellent value.

The hotel grounds are beautiful and the nightly entertainment was much better than we thought it would be. We especially liked the outdoor courtyard at night(lots of servers ready to get you another drink). The water and sand on the beach were beautiful, but crowded. The hotel is in the Playacar area where the hotels are one after the other, pretty close and the beach still has erosion from a hurricane a couple of years ago.

We didn't really find anything negative to report. So here goes... If you traveling with adults only I would suggest staying here. Very few kids b/c there\u2019s nothing for them to do. The food was excellent and the hotel was very nice. The only downfall is that they don\u2019t have king beds. They push two full size beds together to make one big one. It didn\u2019t bother us though we still had a good time. The beds are very hard so I ordered a mattress pad and it made all the difference. There is a separate sitting area with a coffee table and couch so you don\u2019t have to hang out on the bed to watch TV or eat your food. The mini bar is stocked with 4 different kinds of liquor, beer, soda, and bottled water. When you\u2019re at the restaurants you can order ice water and not worry about getting sick. It\u2019s all filtered. I even brushed my teeth with the bathroom facet water. I didn\u2019t drink the bathroom facet water b/c we had bottled water in the room so I would encourage you to drink out of the bottle. The resort itself is very laid back and quiet. There is no music on the beach so very peaceful to read your book or take a nap under the Palm Trees. The pools aren\u2019t that big b/c there aren\u2019t many kids that vacation there. They do have a decent size swim up bar and water volleyball for all to enjoy. Besides the water activities they have beach volleyball, ping pong, dance lessons, and several other activities offered everyday. It\u2019s not a pushy resort so they don\u2019t hassle you do partake in any of the activities, which is very nice. They have the traditional buffet for breakfast everyday with an omelet bar and everything else you could imagine. They even had a smoothie bar at breakfast!!! Lunch was also served buffet style and was probably my favorite meal of the day. I had fajitas everyday for lunch and I never got tired of them!!!!! You have several choices for dinner. There is the traditional buffet (no complaints) with a different theme each night or you can choose from 4 different restaurants which included a Brazilian steakhouse (very good), Japanese (also very good), French (we didn\u2019t try), and a traditional steakhouse (which we couldn\u2019t get reservations). Oh, did I forget to mention that room service is included in your package????? I ordered room service at some point every day. I just tipped the delivery boy a couple of dollars each time and I never had to wait more than 10 minutes for my food. Very Nice!!!! We took a $5 taxi into town to do some shopping. I highly recommend going into town at least once while you\u2019re there. It\u2019s a very safe area so you always feel safe. The shopping towards the south end of 5th Avenue is better than the north end. The south end merchants are willing to negotiate they\u2019re prices. I bought a gift for everyone in my family and never spent more than $10 per person!!! While you\u2019re on 5th Avenue you should also eat at one of the restaurants. You won\u2019t be sorry!!! My shrimp was out of this world and only cost $20. Plus we negotiated a free top shelf drink with our dinner. You really can\u2019t beat that!

There were some setbacks that you have to be aware of before you pick this hotel. When I arrived, the staff at the front desk were very friendly. They offered us drinks and gave us a quick 'tour' of the hotel on a map. Although our trip encountered some bumps in the road, i have to be honest and say the staff is very helpful. But please request for a room on the second floor, courtyard view or not. The one on the lower floors have alot of humidity and high balcony walls, not offering such a good view. One of the bed legs were broken, and the matress slid sideways. On our second day, the showerhead broke and wet everything in the bathroom. And on the same day, the mini-fridge broke as well as the TV. So you could say constantly calling the front desk didn't add much joy to our summer vacation. The pools are very small -- not much room for swimming laps, unless you wanna bump into a few people on the way. But i guess that's ok. The beach was ok, but half was obstructed by a mass of rocks. [The beds, this added as a sudden thought, are very firm and hard.] I enjoyed dining at Don Julian but make sure to make reservations every morning. It can get a little boring (despite having different themes every night, it feels as if it's the same thing as the night before). Please, please be sure to put every one of your electronics and valuable belongings into the safebox in the closet. On my 4th day, I arrived at my room after a blissful day at the beach and found my bags teared apart -- not like how I left them. My daughter's was ripped open and her mp3 player wasen't in it's depths anymore. I didn't want to jump to conclusions but I did, of course -- the house-keeping at the hotel is very poor. I've seen the televisions on when I pass by and they spend more then 15 minutes in each room.

We were a little apprehensive at first, as we had booked our vacation through Apple Vacations and they were slightly unresponsive. Our concerns were this: We were due to arrive on a direct flight from BWI to CUN to arrive at 8:30 a.m. Cancun time. Check in at the hotel is 3:00. Who would keep our bags? Would we still be able to use the facilities? On top of this, about a week prior to our departure, we contacted our travel agent to ask him where our tickets were. He advised us that we were flagged for document pick up at the airport. Huh? We were told that they would be delivered to us 10 days prior to our departure. We asked him for something tangible to travel with, he obliged by sending us an email we could print out and present to the check-in rep at the airport. As it turns out, our concerns regarding lack of documentation were unwarranted. Apple Vacation bought USA3000 a few years back, and when you show up at the airport, you hand them your identification and they hand you your plane ticket, travel vouchers, and shuttle confirmation in a neat little packet for you to carry with. One word to the wise, USA3000 has a strict 50 lbs. per bag limit. If your bag is over 50 lbs., they charge you $50.00 more. So, pack a duffel bag just in case, that way you can separate your stuff at the check-in counter and save yourself some money. The scale is right there... there's no squeeking by. I used the duffel. No biggie. Cancun airport isn't confusing - it's relatively simple, you walk until you find who you're looking for. With Apple Vacations, their people have a Hawaaiian shirt on and are located outside of the terminal. Close to the doors of the terminal where you walk outside, there are probably about 50 people who will try to get your attention to take you on a tour of a local resort/condo facility. Ignore them and keep walking...unless you're into that sort of thing. We loaded a big ol' bus and waited for the rest of the bus to fill up. My husband and I cruise quite frequently, and have up until now avoided the cattle car experience. When booking through Apple, you are cattle. You are expected to wait for the rest of your party - which can be on another flight, arriving at another time. They're not leaving until their busses are full. We sat for a good hour before heading to Playa del Carmen. Just outside of Playa del Carmen (to the south of it) is a resort area which houses about 10 or 15 hotels...this is where the Riu Palace Mexico is located. It's in the middle of the chain of hotels on the waterfront, so by walking north or south along the beach line, you can access other Riu facilities. Playacar is about an hour South of Cancun. It's a straight shot on a highway, and not an unpleasant ride at all. We tipped the bus driver, the luggage handler, and the tour guide from apple. $10 for all three on the way down, per person. The checkin process was painless. You get a towel card, safe key, and a room key. Our rooms were ready when we got there at about 10:30 or so. We were pleased. The rooms are clean and big enough to not knock into eachother. We were on the ground floor, in rooms 34, 36 & 37. Although we had requested adjoining rooms, we were given rooms very close to eachother, but not adjoining. I'm not sure if they have adjoining rooms at this resort...Our rooms faced the outside of the U the hotel makes. To see the inside of the rooms, there are pictures posted everywhere on the internet - surf around. I will warn you that this place is HUMID. You are in a tropical environment. Any wet item that you place on the drying rack located on your balcony will stay wet, first of all, and be covered in mosquitos in the morning. This is not the resort's fault. It's just the way it is! The buffets and restaurants were all acceptable. I won't say superb, I've had better, but I've had worse. I tipped everywhere I went. I read somewhere that the average income for this area of Mexico is approx $360 per month USD. With this in mind, I kept my purse with me most times and tipped a dollar or two with each meal. Finding Mexican food in this resort is a challenge. If you want tacos, take a cab into town and eat at any of the places there. They have cool bars/clubs/restaurants all over Playa del Carmen and for a $5.00 cab ride, you can find pretty much anything you like for the taking. Italian, Steakhouses, Mexican restaurants, etc. About 1/2 way through the week, we'd realized that nothing we'd worn had dried. Usually, you can wear a tshirt once in the morning, and once in the afternoon. This is not the case in a 100 degree climate. By half way through the week, we'd investigated using the laundry services at the resort. They were very expensive. So, we hooked a cab into town, found a laundromat with a Mexican woman to wash our clothes for us. They charge per kilo. It's inexpensive. If you do regular service, it's ready the next day. If you expedite, it's ready within about 6 hours. It's up to you. We expedited and a full load was about 10 dollars, US, folded and dry. What more could we ask? We would have paid the same for about 3 tee shirts at the resort. The excursions we booked through Apple were a toss up. One was great, the other just ridiculous. Our agent at the resort was unavailable after the initial payment was made. The first excursion we took was the Mayan Adventure experience. We snorkeled in 3 different places, a cenote, an ocean inlet, and an underwater cave. The guide was knowledgeable and friendly, and it was money well spent. The lunch they provided tasty. Again, we tipped. About $20 for the day. The second excursion we booked through Apple was cancelled and we were never informed. We waited for over an hour at our designated pick up spot, and returned to the hotel, where our Apple Rep was off for the day. One of the desk staff bent over backwards to help us. We wanted to catamaran, so we remembered the name of Fat Cat, a catamaran that operates locally. We asked him to call them directly, so he did. He went out of his way to make sure that we were booked for the next day, and even arranged payment and pickup for us. The next day, I understand that he was given a hard time by Apple Vacations for overstepping his boundaries. I had to write a letter to be given to the hotel management, Apple Vacations, as well as Fat Cat, to explain that we had asked him to help us directly. Sounds like a little politics, right? I have a bad taste in my mouth when it comes to Apple after this vacation. The way that I see it, he went out of his way to help us. In hindsight, he did what he could to ensure that the hotel's clientele was cared for. Apparently, Apple doesn't support that theory. I will never book through Apple again. Onto the beaches and pools: The beaches of Playacar are wasting away. There is a 5 foot drop off at the edge of the palm trees to get down to the water at this resort. The neighboring hotels either have something similar or no beach at all. Still, we made the best of it and walked up and down the shoreline looking for the ultimate beach experience. You can use any Riu facility when you stay at the Riu Palace Mexico. We used a couple of the other Rius while we were there. Different resorts have different classes of alchohol, by the way. When you ask for premium liquors at some of the neighboring resorts, they'll laugh at you and tell you to go back to your luxury resort. Hee hee. I took it all with a grain of salt. You're on vacation. If a better class of alcohol will make or break your day, then stay in the upper eschalon of the Riu hotels, such as the Riu Palace Mexico or the Riu Palace Rivera Maya. Stay away from the hotels that cater to the party crowd...Riu Tequila or Yucatan. You'll get water aerobics there with a wigged bunch that tells jokes, not premium liquors. As for the return, you're on the cattle car again...You wait in the lobby for your bus to arrive and then get driven all over the place on the way to the airport. It's up to you whether you get bent out of shape about it...I have already stated that I will never do an Apple vacation again. I prefer direct and preferential treatment, something you are not afforded with a group attitude travel company. Lesson learned.

I definitely recommend hiring the harpist and getting married on the beach! There is some beach erosion, but it actually worked out well for the wedding. We were basically right on the beach and there were no sunbathers in any of our photos! Best of all...our guests were able to sit in the shade of palm trees. In all we had 17 guests. The resort did a great job of always putting seats together, decorating the tables, and giving our group extra attention! No one had reason to complain! My uncle celebrated a birthday while he was there. No one in our party informed the hotel yet they somehow knew and decorated his room with towel animals, balloons and flowers. At dinner the table was decorated, they sang happy birthday and even presented him with a large birthday cake. The resort truly is gorgeous! Even the \"lowest grade\" rooms are impressive. Every room is a suite and has its own mini bar. My husband and I even got upgraded to a suite facing the ocean at no additional charge. (the beds are kind of hard and are two full size beds pushed together....bet somehow I had amazing sleep on the trip!) Note of warning: This isn't a place for kids.

One of our party was ill whilst we were there and again Katie came to the rescue she was great. Rooms The rooms looked a little dark at first as we overlooked the side of the hotel and a walkway to the beach next door but it was a quiet location which was great. The cleanliness of the rooms and the maid service was excellent and the towel sculptures kept us smiling ...the mermaid was particularly good. I was impressed by the reception and guest services who did ring and check a couple of times if everything was ok and we were enjoying our stay. Pool The pool was lovely we stayed on the quiter side and it was never crowded and sunbeds were available most of the day. The pool cleanliness was the best I have seen. Restaurants We visited 3 of the 4 speciality restaurants ( not the brazilian) our favourites were the steakhouse and Japanese which we went to twice, the buffet restaurant was also great I cannot understand anyone who is negative regarding the food as there was always fresh food arriving at all times even as the buffet was due to close Beach Well what can I say it is a real shame that the beach is not as it appears in the brochure photos and hopefully this can be remedied as soon as possible however it didn't spoil our stay Staff I cannot praise the staff enough NOTHING is too much trouble the restaurant staff were great especially Juan and Brigado. The bar staff made our holiday and were very attentive we just had to smile and another glass of champagne was at hand. Roy, Raul, Armando Jr, Oniver, Lopez, Manuel, Carmen, Lupita , David and of course Toni ( Antonio Banderas..... ) and I am sorry if I missed anyone they work so hard but remain cheerful and enjoyed the banter with us, we even taught them how to speak like a northerner instead of 'lovely jubbly' .

The one downside is the beach....it kept eroding while we were there, right before our eyes....it's not so bad though because there are still areas to get inside the water, and once you're in, the water is absolutely beautiful.

We have NEVER been to an all inclusive resort so we have nothing to compare this too...but it was TRULY amazing!!!! We have been reading all the comments from previous people that have wrote about the resort so we went in knowing about the beach, hard beds and what not. HOWEVER...I don't agree completly with everything I have read. Here is a REAL QUICK review of what I thought about everything.... BEACH: wonderful....YES, it's not all there...but by no means does this take away from the resort. Yes there are hard sand stones around the entrance of the beach...I feel and scraped my knee...but it was no big deal, the beach was beautiful and had many places to play in the waves or boogee board or swim. As for laying out, it's mostly palmtress around...so you mostly in the shade laying out on the beach. But again, this didn't bother us one bit!! I have read some that alot of people come up to you while you are laying on the beach to try to sell you stuff...I was under the impression that there was TONS of ppl. that would come and bother you....thats NOT the case at ALL!!! We hardly saw anyone walking around...and if they do come up to you, all you have to do is say no thanks and they leave you alone. RESORT GROUNDS: BEAUTIFUL!!!!! AMAZING!!!!! I feel in love with this place and hated that our vacation had to end...I loved everything about the grounds and the emloyees do EVERYTHING to ensure that they are manitained. EMPLOYEES: They do everything possible to make sure you are happy and make sure you need everything you need. RESORT ROOMS: We read to request a courtyard view apon arrival, we did and our friends got one...but we didn't, I was VERY disapointed at first because ALL I read was how all the other rooms suck and whatnot and that was NOT the case again....our room was perfect...we had our own little personal balcony that was very nice and peaceful. The beds were hard...but not TOO hard, but we requested a matress pad which made them almost as comfy as our beds at home. You don't have to tip the made but we did about 3-5 dollars a day and we got nice towel animals everynight, except the last. My husband asked the maid for flowers on the bed since it was our anniversary and when we came back from the beach that evening there were beautiful swans in a heart like shape with flowers everywhere...it was beautiful!!!!!!!! ENTERTAINMENT: Everynight they have a show...we saw Las Vegas, Grease and Michael Jackson...they were very entertaining. I loved them all.. ..I saw nothing to complain about them...they of course are not professionals...but it was worth the time to see them!!!!! FOOD: Was GREAT!!!! Buffett was wonderful.....something for everyone there...the only other side dinners we tried was La Bodega (Spelling???)...which was WONDERFUL...but it took FOREVER, so if you have anything planned that night don't plan on eating here...but I do recomend trying it one night....and the other one was Sir Edwards....it was GREAT too!!! Other than taht we stuck with the buffett...it was the BEST! As far as making reservations....its not as bad as ppl. made it out to be....we were already up that early.. ..we just walked in, NEVER had to wait in line, asked what they had open....and that was it....it NEVER took longer than 5 minutes!!!! EXTRAS: My husband, I and our 2 friends parasailed (VERY awesome and I suggest thius to everyone) we also swam with the dolphins at dolphin discovery and we did a jungle tour in Cancun where we snorkeled. It was worth the extra money spent. NEEDLESS to say we had a blast, I would recommend this resort to anyone...I wish our vacation wasn't over.

Our wedding was at the Gran Bahia Prinicpe the week before, but we decided to try somewhere new for our vacation as newlyweds. The Riu is beautiful as a hotel and for it's landscape. Food is always such a personal matter. We really enjoyed it - the buffet and the a la carte restuarants. As for the beds, yes, they are hard. When checking in you may as well as ask for a mattress cover right away. It makes such a difference. Our room was in the back of the hotel. We had read about the 2 beds pushed together but gave it a try. It is pretty unromantic, but you make due... At first we asked to move rooms (for the view) and they gave us some run around about how we couldn't change rooms untilt he next day so we just stayed. As it turns out, the room was great - having a private balcony facing the back courtyard was perfect! We took full advantage of having a private \"sunbathing\" area, which we wouldn't have had in any other room. We were not crazy about the beach. It's very squishy and it takes about 2 minutes to walk from one end to the other. We would go down to jump in the waves (you cannot swim or snorkel here) , but lie by the pool to relax. The waves in the ocean are quite large. I stumbled a few times and got a nasty scratch on my leg. Also, regarding injuries, be careful entering the shower/tub. I slipped three times and bruised the same spot on my leg from the tub. It did not look good in honeymoon photos! One further note regarding safety - do not touch the seaweed. My husband got a terrible rash from it under his arms that burned something awful. We don't know what it was, but we know it was fromt he seaweed. If you are sensative to cigarette smoke, DO NOT GO HERE. We are not smokers and there were times we could not bear to walk through the lobby, bar, or in the theatre. The stench stays on your cloths and in your suitcase. Also, there is a nasty rotting garbage smell near the theatre/restaurants which becomes quite unbearable. I would not visit here again just based on the smells! We did like the Riu for it's location. We probably spent more time off the resort grounds. We rented a car, which is really the way to go. We went to the Cristal cenotes, which were amazing, We actually had the entire cenote to ourselves! It is past Tulum and pretty sketchy, but well worth it and only $4/pp! Akumal beach (more than once) for FREE access to a non touristy beach and the best snorkling, Yakul ja (also for snorkling), Tulum, Cozumel (the biggest waste of a day and money!) and into Playa Del Carmen. We've been a few times to this area so if you have any questions about what to see/do please feel free to ask. Overall, we love the area but will not stay at the Riu again.

My wife and I spent 2 weeks in the Riu Palace in May 07. The hotel is well laid out. All the rooms are large with a sofa / seating area and balcony/terrace. The layout of the hotel is like a giant \"C\", with square sides. This means 50% of the rooms face inwards to a beautiful fountain area (in all the brochures) and 50% face outwards to neighbouring properties. If you can, get a fountain facing room - they are the premium rooms, but as we were not in peak season we did not pay extra, though it was arranged at time of booking. The trip was our first all inclusive holiday. Given this, we knew to expect buffet style and if you don't expect a michelin-starred restaurant, you won't be disappointed. The main evening buffet was great - themed nights and always a big selection of different items, to cater for most tastes. As well as the main restaurant, there are 4 other restaurants, all requiring booking and they operate on a sitting system, so there is less flexibility in them. The Japanese and Gourmet (French) are worth a visit. Booking system is a bit of a pain, but not overly-so. We spent most of our time by the pool - lots of sunbeds to choose from, no need to hog with towels. Loads on the beach too. There is an issue with the beach in the hotel and along the peninsula - it is being eroded away by the sea. If you want to spend a few days by the sea as part of your holiday, fine. If you want to spend your entire holiday on the beach, check the status of it before you book. It is changing on an almost weekly basis. As \"palace\" guests, you can use the facilities of all Riu hotels in the area (there are 5). The nearest one is literally next door - 2 mins along the beach. We used that.

It was our third visit to the hotel in the last 4yrs and it definetly wont be our last! After speaking to other guests we are not the only ones to return year after year! The staff are all friendly and polite and nothing is too much trouble for them. Many of them remembered us by name when we returned this year! The food is gorgeous & they have a very wide selection. Breakfast is served from 7am - 12pm and they have everything you could think of including cereal, full english, pancakes, fresh fruit and smoothies. Lunch is between 12.30pm - 3pm in three restaurants everyday and again there is a very wide selection. Dinner is serverd between 6pm - 10pm. The main buffet restaurant has a different theme each night including Mexican, Oriental, Italian and Caribean. The hotel also has four restaurants they are Brazilian, French, Japanese and a Steakhouse. I would recommend all of them. To eat in any of these you have to book between 8.30am - 10am on the day you want to eat there. The French and Japenese have two sittings per night, 6.30pm and 9pm. You can more or less pick any time you want for the other two restaurants. We never had any trouble booking a table for the 10 of us in any of these restaurants. The evening entertainment has improved a lot since our first visit, there is a live band and a show everynight and excellent waiter service so you dont have to move from your seat! If you just fancy a quiet night the Cubano bar is the place to go. There are two pools, both have waiter service. A quiet one to just chill out and the other one has a swim up bar and lots of seating, you can also play volleyball and do water areobics in this one! There are plenty of sun loungers to choose from as well so you dont have to save them with a towel every morning! The pool and the beach more or less run into each other and there are also loads of sun loungers on the beach as well as some hammocks and they are so comfy! Dont let what other people have said about the beach put you off. It has eroded a bit but you can get access to the sea from the Riu Yucatan next door. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, they all have a hairdryer and full size ironing board and iron. The mini bar is well stocked with spirits and Corona and soft drinks and gets filled up daily. The beds are really comfortable as well. There are six Riu hotels in Playacar, the furthest is a five minute walk away, as a guest at the Riu Palace you can use all of their facilities but they cant use the Palace. You can eat in any of these hotels for breakfast and lunch but not for dinner. There are nightclubs in the Riu Playacar (next door) and the Riu Tequila (opposite). The Tequila is probably the best for evening entertainment and has a sports bar to watch all the big games! Playacar has quite a few shops to pick up some souveniers and is only over the road from the hotel. Playa del carmen is much more built up and worth a $5 taxi ride. Xel-ha is also worth a visit if you enjoy snorkelling. There are no hidden extras at the Riu Palace it really is all inclusive! Overall i gave this holiday 10/10.

We arrived in our room which was nice and cool. It was a suite, which all the rooms are. The bed that is to be a king are two doubles pushes together, they are all like that. Yes, the beds are hard but we slept very well beacause the beach, pool and drinks wear you out. From the bed area you step down in the living area which has a sofa and television. From there you walk out onto the patio.The bathroom was very clean (a clean bathroom is a telling sign to me) and up to date.There is one sink a bath/shower tub combo and then a toilet in another space with a seperate door. The pools are are very clean and refreshing. The waiters come around and serve you drinks. There is a swim up pool bar. If you want a snack they have chips and melted nacho cheese at any time. The beaches are very clean and have soft sand to step on. Yes, there is a beach erosion problem but once you get a glimse of the water who cares!! You have about a two foot drop and in front of the hotel it is roped off. You walk just a few steps to the right and you arrive at the RIU Yucatan, there is access to the beach. Reaslly it is not a big issue!! The people staying at the RIU Playacar and RIU Palace Riveria Maya have no beach. There is plenty of food and a wide variety! If you can not find something to eat between the room service, buffets and specialty restaurants there is something wrong! The only complaint I have is there is not a lot of Mexican food and men must wear long pants to every dinner , buffet or not. We only went on one tour, the Mayan Adventure that takes you to three diffrent sites to snorkel. The first was a reef out in the ocean. We saw sting rays, baracudas and beautiful tropical fish. The next was a cave, the water was so clear but cold! The third was a cenote (sinkhole) where you can jump about twenty feet off a cliff into the water, you can also use the steps. We saw an eel, turtles and more fish. Our guide was Marisol, he was so friendly and just a pleasure to spend the day with!! The resort is layed back and geared toward families and couples. If you want more action with music and games that will make you laugh walk over to the RIU Yucatan. The crowd is younger.

Let me say this.. the hotel is gorgeous! The staff is very helpful and pleasant! For those two reason we had an OK time. The food is horrible, and the beach is eroded and the beds feel like you are sleeping on a rock with sandpaper covering you. The beds are also two full size beds, pushed together to make a King. So if you plan on sleeping next to your partner.... one of you will be sleeping he crack (we asked other couples we met there and all the rooms are like this). The beach is a cliff of sand and then drops 15 feet to the water. You can go to the RIU that is next to the RIU Palace and use their beach, but so does everyone else so it is crowded. Also, there is no waitress/waiter service on the beach, so if you want to drink and relax, you will have to go get you're own drinks at the Tiki Hut or Pool Bar which isn't that close to the beach. Back to the food, if you read the RIU site and brochure they claim to have culinary chefs... I\"m not sure what chefs they are using but I can cook better than them. The buffet is the same food options every day for breakfast/lunch and dinner. To go to the resturants you must make reservations by 10am (which isn't bad), but the late seating (8:45-9pm) fills up early, so you may get stuck with the early seating with this 6-6:45pm. We didn't like the fact that we had to make reservation every night, it caused us to be on their schedule, not our own, while on OUR vacation. We'd be sitting at the pool, asking what time it was b/c if we missed our dinner reservation, when we'd be eating at the buffet - AGAIN. The other thing is... the first day you get there, you can't make reservations at any of the resturants unless you get there before 10am, so this forces you to eat at the buffet. The wine selection... well there really isn't one, it's one white and one red to pick from. We had the red one night and it taste like grape juice. Overall the drinks are lite, ask for double or triple shots in your drinks and they will taste like a normal drink here in the states. We went to Xel-Ha for snorkeling, which is awesome. The only thing is... it is all day. You leave the hotel at 8am and don't get back until 6pm. Which again means you can't make reservations to eat at a resturant. If you go to Xel-Ha, only go for a 1/2 day. We found out after we bought the excursion and were on the bus that we could of done a 1/2 day at Xel-Ha and 1/2 day at the Tulum Ruins, which is only 10 minutes from Xel-Ha. It was our tour companies fault for not giving us all the options (Olympus Tours). By 1pm or so, you are tired of Xel-Ha and snorkeling, we sat at the bar for the rest of the day. Also, I would suggest taking a cab to and from the airport to the hotel. The Tour Companies drop off at several hotels and it makes the trip over an hour when it should be 30-40 mintues to the hotel. Overall.... I wouldn't go to another RIU and this RIU wasn't worth the money we paid for our trip, which was over 3400.00 with airfare for 5 nights. I've stayed at other hotels that are all inclusive like DREAMS in Puerta Vallarta that was much better as far as food, drinks and beach. It may of not had the grand entrance way with marble floors, etc... but it was a much better experience. GO AT YOUR OWN RISK. Keep in mind also, my boyfriend and I live in a Metropolitian Area, close to NYC and frequent resturants. We met other people from the midwest and west coast that didn't complain about the food as much, but still weren't happy with it. Most of the people there were couples, some families, not a lot of kids. Mostly couples our age in there mid to late 30's and a few couples in there 40's and 50's.", "Date": "May 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cCharming Riu Palace\u201d", "Author": "SoJersey", "ReviewID": "UR7707699", "Content": "Just got back from Riu Palace - we loved it!

Service was top class as ever and the food was well served as ever. BUT: On the first day of our arrival we went to what we thought was the beach as we left it two years ago. We experienced the biggest disappointment of our holidays as we arrived at the end of the palm trees and saw only water of the sea. The only place you could spend at the beach was under the palm trees and we had to step one meter down without stairs to be directly in the sea. When we left two years ago we had a beach of about 60 to 70 meters wide giving as much privacy as we wished to spend our holidays. Now we had to place our beds side by side with other people which gave no privacy at all. After a few days the beach got somehow wider however after a week it eroded again to the palm trees and even old trees and rocks appeared from underwater so we had to put our beds in the direction of the Yucatan hotel beach which was even more crowded than we experienced during the days before. Moreover getting into the water got more and more dangerous as we regularly stepped on hooked rocks which were under water and caused injuries to myself and my wife. This was all very disappointing to us and upon reporting this to the hotel's management we only received a confirmation of the problem but no foreseen action plan to improve the situation for the customers. This has made us decide not to return to RIU Palace Mexico before all of this has been taken care of. One last bad thing was the annoying behaviour of some people during the night during 7 days of our stay passing the corridors of the hotel shouting and kicking doors with the only meaning to awaken other customers. Sad to learn no action was taken by the hotel security to prevent this.", "Date": "May 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Metro-Boston", "Title": "\u201cMove up the beach to Riu Palace Riveria Maya\u201d", "Author": "KMP410", "ReviewID": "UR7672522", "Content": "In the interest of full disclosure, I should note that this hotel was not our (my wife and I's) first choice. We had spent most of the time prior to our trip preparing to stay at the Grand Velas Resort and Spa in Nuevo Vallarta. However, because of some last minute changes to our travel schedule, we ended up here - not the end of the world, but certainly not comparable to the Grand Velas. Secondly, this was our third trip to Mexico, in previous years we had stayed at the Royal Hideaway and Secrets Excellence Riviera Cancun (while it was still SERC before it was sold and became ERC). Since we were not venturing to the west coast, as originally planned, we decided that we wanted to go back to Playacar. We decided not to go back to RH and try someplace new instead, thus, we ended up at the Riu Palace Mexico. We took a standard transfer from the airport and when we arrived at the hotel's front entrance, despite there being no one around waiting for a transfer, taxi, etc., and no one else arriving at the time, there was no one to be found to welcome us to the hotel and/or help with our luggage. Now, we are certainly capable of managing our own luggage (and in fact, normally do) however, it would have been nice to see a smiling face welcoming us to the resort and directing us to the front desk (not being totally devoid of a sense of direction, however, we managed to find it on our own ... though not before passing three bellman standing around having a conversation with each other). We checked in and got keys to our room and elected to carry our own bags to our room (mainly because no one at the front desk offered the help of bell services). When we walked into the room, we were both disappointed. The room was dingy, the floor was sticky (like it hadn't been mopped in weeks), there was a painting/wall hanging missing from the wall (the hooks and outline of the picture were still there), and there were several half empty beer bottles in the mini-bar fridge and tucked away behind the mini-bar glasses. We decided to sit down on the bed and collect ourselves for a minute before venturing out onto the grounds, and found that the beds were like cement and the pillows like rocks (now we're used to the hard beds in Mexico, but these were exceptionally hard). We decided to check out the rest of the hotel and wandered outside down towards the pool and beach to grab a little lunch. We walked around both sides of the buffet, and nothing looked remotely appetizing - we managed to find a few things that did not look like they had been sitting under heat lamps for hours, but even after a few bites, we settled on salad and bread. After lunch we took a walk down the street to the Riu Palace Riviera Maya ... it was like night and day. The building was impeccable, we got a peek at the rooms which were beautiful (and clean!) and the food at the buffet looked (and tasted) much better than what we had not more than an hour before at the Riu Palace Mexico. We returned to the Riu Palace Mexico and spoke with the manager, we explained that we wanted to switch to the Riu Palace Riveria Maya and he agreed to call their booking office the next day (as it was a Sunday and they were currently closed) and see if there was availability and we could switch. That night we ate at the dinner buffet (we couldn't get into a specialty restaurant .... see below for more on that). The best of the dinner was sitting outside on the patio of the restaurant enjoying the warm Mexican night and ocean breeze (the food was nothing spectacular). The next morning we were able to make the switch, and the rest of our week was fantastic at the Riu Palace Riveria Maya... It's still not on the same level as RH or ERC (however, you also pay considerably less here, and for the money you spend, it's an amazing value). Also, the poolside service was just as good as the poolside service at the RH and probably better than that at ERC. The rooms are nicely appointed and kept very clean. The food is very good - breakfast and lunch buffets offer moderate variety (however, still much of the same everyday, which can become a little boring by the end of the week). The specialty restaurants are very good - enjoyed the Oriental restaurant the most (went back twice). A word on the reservation system at both Riu Palaces... if you take nothing else that I said above to heart, then at least consider this when making your choice. Reservations at the Riu Palace Mexico must be made the morning of the day you want to eat. You have to go to the theater and get a number, and then at 8:30a or 9:00a they start taking reservations. You have to do this every morning. Reservations at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya can be made each day between 1p and 4p in the lobby bar, and you can make two reservations a day (so, essentially you can make all the reservations by the middle of your trip, if you make two each day). Also, you can be put on a wait list at the Riviera Maya in case there are cancellations (we had to do this to get a second night at the Oriental restaurant) and the staff actually does their best to get you into the restaurant if you're on the waitlist. It's entirely worth it to pay the extra $100/$150 per person for a week to stay at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya instead of the Riu Palace Mexico... don't find that out for yourself when it's too late, trust us on this one!!", "Date": "May 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "WV", "Title": "\u201cMy Impression of the RIU Palace - Mexico\u201d", "Author": "kimrochelles", "ReviewID": "UR7668463", "Content": "I just returned from the Riu Palace - Mexico. I have found the reviews through Trip Advisor helpful so I thought I'd post one on this resort. I have visited the Riviera Maya south of Cancun 3 different times so I do have something to compare with from the area. I have read a lot of the previous reviews and will try to comment on things I have read. The Positives first because I believe the positives outweigh any negatives experienced: The resort itself is immaculate and beautiful and all the staff I came into contact during my recent stay May 13-May 20th, 2007 were EXCELLENT. The entire RIU Staff is quite impressive, They are hardworking, friendly, helpful and in my opinion enjoy their jobs. The daily entertainment staff is BY FAR the best I have experienced in the area. They are always polite, professional, fun to be around and do not try to push guests into games and activities. They do try to encourage guests to participate in the daily activities but do not get annoying. The entire entertainment staff was great but especially Kike, Jessica, Mickey, and Edourato helped me have a lot of fun and gave me lots of memories to take home with me! The shows at night were done by different individuals who were exceptionally talented so go to the nightly shows if possible. The titles and themes of the shows don't always make sense but the dancing is very impressive. The front desk staff was awesome too. They greeted us with a smile, remembered who we were and were always as helpful as they could be. The food was great. I would however recommend the Don Julian Restaurant over the Terrace/Patio restaurant by the beach. The food selection was better. Unfortunately I can't comment on any of the restaurants requiring reservations at this resort because I never tried them. I just didn't want to have to be tied down to a certain time for dinner on vacation. A lot of the guests did rave about the different restaurants here though that required reservations. The Negatives. I was VERY concerned about possible beach erosion at this resort before I left as I had just seen reviews pop up about it a few weeks before I left. Unfortunately I found this to be true. There actually is no beach per se at the RIU Palce Mexico that one can walk into and swim in. One has to go up about 25 yards to the RIU Yucatan to really enjoy a swim in the ocean. I would also HIGHLY recommend not trying to climb the rocks and get into the ocean at the RIU palace. I even heard some people had injuries from the rocks to their feet.My understanding is the erosion started about 4 months ago with a storm and continues to get worse daily. When I mean daily I really mean it. It is amazing to see conditions deteriorate just over a period of 7 days. The view of the ocean from the RIU Palace is splendid though looking down or out over the Caribbean. I was also told that the RIU Palace is trying to figure a way to get the beach back but that will no doubt take time. I was told that as of about 6 months ago there was a VERY large beautiful beach and now it is virtually non-existent so I am positive the resolution won't occur overnight. I think in general the Playacar Playa Del Carmen area really has experienced major beach erosion. The resort next to the RIU Palace Mexico called Windham Viva Maya has even worse beach problems and it appears they are at risk of losing a dive shop from erosion. I saw a person digging sand moving it up toward the structure during the day. They also had big black items designed to keep sand from washing away all over the beach. Their guests literally had to crawl over these to go into ocean water. I am not sure what is occurring with the ocean conditions but even walking up further there's apparently beach erosion occurring although not so obvious. There's big dropoffs walking out to the ocean, and the water routinely appeared murky and muddy in places where I think dirt and sand were being forced up doing erosion. I love the Riviera Maya. Until the beach erosion issues are resolved I will probably stay further south of Playa Del Carmen where there evidently isn't as much erosion. The good news is that there is a beach available to Ru Palace Mexico guests that isn't too bad nearby about 25-50 yards. The rooms were very nice but there was one thing I did not like. There's really not room for two double beds so they put them together so it is like one big King bed. Be aware of this if sharing a room. Who you share a room with will be your sleeping partner for the duration whether you want to or not! Guests are given towel cards for only one towell for use at beach and ocean. This was irritating to me. We really need two towells one to lay on, one to dryoff with. My family and friends and I took to taking a room towell with us. I previously seen reviews talking about loud music from other resorts bothering them. I think what is being referred to here is that the next door Windham Viva Maya has an outdoor show starting around 10:30PM lasting til about 1AM. It is pretty loud I admit. When I closed the patio doors though I wasn't much bothered by the noise though. Comparing to the other resorts I stayed at there's more beach vending going on on these beaches and that was a little annoying to me. It seems like every 1/2 hour someone was trying to sell me bracelets. I don't think the RIU approves of this. In fact we actually saw several times people being run off or were even told by RIU staff not to buy what these guys were selling because they items were fake. They were not pushy though. WIth a no they wouldn't bother you again at least that day. I'd recommend that guests request a upper floor room too. The bottom floors are must more accessible tand I didn't feel safe on a bottom floor room. The RIU staff readily switched us though and that was much appreciated. In Summary: I loved the RIU Palace Mexico. The resort was beautiful ,staff was fantastic. The beach or lack of one was somewhat of an issue. I am glad I stayed at the RIU because I had a wonderful time in paradise but I will probably not stay there again until the beach problem is resolved.", "Date": "May 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cLoved the RIU!\u201d", "Author": "fer1Usa", "ReviewID": "UR7667089", "Content": "We just returned from a weeklong stay at Riu Palace Mexico. After reading tripadvisor obsessively in the months before our trip, I feel it is my duty to post a review. First, the food. It is incredible, really. Even picky eaters should have no problem finding something to eat. The reservation process for a la carte dinners was a little annoying, but my husband managed to get us our first choice in a matter of 15 minutes each time (we ate at 3 of the 4) so no big deal. My favorite was Sir Edward. My husband loved the brazilian place. They were all good. The dinner buffett is amazing as well. The rooms were clean and pretty. Housekeeping did a great job of coming in promptly to clean our rooms. We never experienced any theft; and we got a little careless with leaving things out on a few occasions (not smart, but after a few pina coladas, what can you do?) We were upgraded to a courtyard view at no charge because the music from the hotel next door (Viva Wyndham Maya) kept us up late on the 1st night. The pool was smaller than some of the other resorts I've been to, but it was never super crowded and the swim up bar was fun. We went next door another Riu and the pool was way overcrowded, so were were pleased with ours. The beach is beautiful. The water is a picturesque tourqoise and there are always plenty of chairs. There is a slight dropoff from the area with the chairs to the water, but this is to be expected in this part of Mexico. It did seem to increase over the week we were there, but it did not detract from our enjoyment of the beach. Drinks were yummy and plentiful. You can always ask for premium liquor and doubles if you mind that sort of thing. They only have a couple types of wine for dinner, none of which I was crazy about, but they were drinkable. The ONLY negative thing I have to say was about the beds. I read the reviews about the hard beds and thought maybe some were being a little whiny and particular but I soon found out for myself. First, there are 2 full beds pushed together. They even have seperate bedding! Not so romantic! They are soooo hard and they sink in the middle. Our backs were killing us by the end of the week (and no, we aren't old fogeys!) It was hard to get a good night's sleep and I really never woke up feeling rested. I hate to say it, but I probably won't stay there again unless they fix the beds. Unfortunate, because everything else is so great! Overall, though beautiful property and a good value.

I was a little surprised and confused to read previous negative reviews of this hotel however they are individual opinions and in reply I can only assume those people were unlucky. My Fiancee and I arrived at the hotel at 5 pm on 29 May, we were greeted by the ever polite and friendly doorman Manuel with a cold welcoming drink. We asked for a nice room at check in (remembering Trip Advisor reviews read pre holiday about rooms with courtyard views), we received the jovial reply \" all our rooms are nice\". This brought a laugh and we learned upon entering our room that the receptionist's confidence was correct. Our room was indeed nice and overlooked the main square and bandstand. I understand that it is not always possible to get a room that overlooks the courtyard and it is advisable to request one if possible. We found that everything was possible at the RIU Palace Mexico and you only had to request it. For example we didn't like 2 out of the 4 choices available from the liquor dispenser in our room, we asked for replacements which were changed within 10 minutes. On the day of my Fiancee's Birthday I asked at the reception if they could help in anyway. We returned to our room from spending the day by the pool to discover the maid had decorated the room with animals made from towels and had hung balloons and ribbons from the walls. A card and gift were also left from the staff at RIU. We requested extra towel cards (only one issued on arrival per person) as the bottom of the sun loungers were getting quite hot with the sun beaming down on them. The reception staff kindly obilged, no more burnt feet. I'll try and reduce this review or I could be here all day. Reception - Grand Pools (2) - Quiet pool for relaxing. Livelier pool with swim up bar and where daily activities took place. Grounds/Gardens - Immaculate Beach - Sadly eroded back to line of Palm trees due to Mother Nature but still sufficient space and beds to relax if you prefer the beach to the pool. Gym/Spa - No Comment as didn't visit. Bars: (all waiter/ess service except swim up bar) Pool bar - nice place to sit and relax Swim up bar - busier in the afternoons Lounge bar - where evening entertainment is held Piano bar - quaint and next to reception Entertainment - Daily activites. Nightly shows and music in the lounge. Restaurants: (all require reservations daily and have two sittings at 6.30 and 9 pm except buffet where you can eat at anytime) Sir Edward - Gourmet The food and service here is exceptional. Set menu with different choices of 3 course meal. Miyagi - Japanese Do try this, the Sushi is particularly good. Sushi to start followed again by set menu with a choice of 3 course meal. La Bodega - Brazillian 7 types of meat served one after the other with veg. Salad/soup to start finished by a selection of desserts. Only went once as choice of food is the same once visited. Meat is nice though. El Patio - Steakhouse Had Tuna and B-B-Q ribs which were very good. Set menu again with different choices. Salad/soup to start with selection of desserts. Lunch is also available here (reservation not required) where Burgers and Hotdogs are on offer. Next door at La Traviata Italian dishes such as Pizza and Pasta can be found. Mexican dishes are also served and the usual salad/soup/desserts are readily available. Don Julian - Buffet There is so much variety here and no reservation is required. There are theme nights so you can imagine the choices on show each evening. This is where you eat breakfast, if you like smoked Salmon then you'll be happy as it was available most mornings. This is in addition to your usual English fry up, American pancakes, waffles, smoothies, fruit galore, omelettes cooked while you wait,etc. Lunch is also available here where more than fast food is served. Do walk back from the pool rather than taking the easy option at El Patio near the pools as it was often quieter and you had more choice. The food choice was endless and I still laugh at an American comment I overheard that the food was average. It is certainly not average! The staff worked tirelessly to make your stay enjoyable and were so polite and friendly. I have to mention Lopez, Raul, Roy, Miguel who ran the pool bar by day and managed the drink situation at the main square in the evening. Believe me you never had an empty glass with these guys about. Yamir one of the head waiters in the buffet also deserves a mention, he was a star. Our stay really was amazing from entering the hotel entrance to waving a sad goodbye to Manuel on the door. Do try this hotel, we stayed at the RIU Cancun previously which is good but this is better. Tips: Request a courtyard view upon check in if possible. If you require a 6.30 sitting at a restaurant you may need to be towards the front of the queue as this time seemed more popular than the 9 pm sitting. Don't miss the Michael Jackson tribute night, it is only on once every fortnight and this guy can dance! We saw him in Cancun and were really happy that he was on again at this hotel this time. Don't act like the Americans and do say please and thank you as the staff fully deserve it and I think appreciated the manners shown. Won't continue as could go on and on.

On arriving everything looked ok. Quick check in, shown to our Rooms:- We was not over impressed on first glance. We did request 2 rooms over looking the Courtyard. Instead we got 2 rooms at the back of the hotel, over looking the noisy hotel next door. We unpacked our cases and tried to shower, but the shower head was broken, we reported it to Reception which fell on deaf ears. Next day the sink was not running away, again reported it to the maid, nothing was ever done. The beds was the most hardest disgusting beds I have ever slept in with massive rips in them, they need replacing, they have seen better days. The view from our balcony was a brick wall, not what what you expect from a 5 Star Palace. Beach:- We went to find the beach, but the beach was gone the erosion of the beach is terrible and the beach is very dangerous, with massive drops into the sea. The chairs are all in a line, with no room to even turn them around. They palm trees are falling into the sea and are all roped together, its a mess. This hotel needs to knock the coconuts off the trees at the beach, or someone is going to get seriously hurt if one falls off. Weddings:- There are 2 weddings a day at this hotel, which takes priority over everything, there needs to be a reserved area for weddings to take place. If you are on the so called beach beware, you will have a wedding set up around you in minutes while you are sitting on a sun lounger. They set the wedding arch up and then out come the speakers and music, they drape dangerous wires all over you and try to apologise for the inconvience and tell you it will be for 5 minutes only. This becomes a very awkward situation when you are trying to relax on your vacation, and also very unpleasant for the wedding party. Food:- The ala cartes are good, the evening buffet was mainly fish, if you dont like fish, salad is the other option. The lunch time buffets at the pool was horrible, no selection, other than pizza, hot dogs or hamburgers, the salad looked stale and there was no selection of food to go with a salad. Overall:- The grounds of this hotel are immaculate, the rooms need to be stripped out and refurbished, the staff are very over worked, I would not say the happiest of people, they try there best. The hotel management are constantly asking you are you enjoying the Palace and will you return, I think they know that this hotel is hitting on massive problems, and are very unsure what customers are thinking. Unfortunately this hotel is more like a 3 star hotel, with 5 star prices. We will return to Mexico but definately not the Palace, its certainly not how it is sold.", "Date": "May 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Windsor, Canada", "Title": "\u201cHoneymoon\u201d", "Author": "TamaraMc", "ReviewID": "UR7543641", "Content": "I just discovered tripadvisor.com or I would have written this review almost 2 years ago. Our experience was so horrible that I still get upset thinking about it. My husband and I had contemplated booking at the Riu Tequila; however we thought we would spend the extra money as it was our honeymoon and why not pamper ourselves. Upon check-in at the Riu Palace there was not enough space in the immediate vicinity for us to sit for the welcome briefing. I had to approach the front desk for information such as booking reservations at the restaurants and the in room safe keys as we couldn\u2019t hear a word. Our mornings started off the same everyday, being woken from our sleep at 7:00am as our room was in a back hallway that was used by hotel employees to transport items such as the towel cart. There was also construction at the property adjacent our building which also ensured we were up by seven. We requested to be moved several times and were ignored. When we were choosing hotels we noticed in the advertisement that honeymooners would receive a special gift from the hotel. After speaking with out Sunquest Rep and the Front Desk Manager several times and being promised it would be in our room by the end of the day (3 days in a row) we gave up. On more then one occasion our drink orders with meals were either lost or forgotten. The food was OK but definitely not fantastic. The only compliment I can pay this resort is that the young lady at the towel booth was delightful.

The hotel. On our very first impression the hotel was beautiful, the lobby area was very impressive and our first encounter with a member of staff (Luis at the front desk) left us feeling instantly impressed with the quality of service. The grounds, gardens and all public areas are immaculate, the staff seem to be working around the clock to keep the hotel and grounds looking truly stunning. Our room was extremely clean and tidy, if you try to find a fault no doubt you will see the odd cracked tile but overall these little things arent noticable. The hotel is 10 years old afterall. The pool area is very nice and well maintained. But no deep end of the pool left me wanting more The beach was very nice and on some days breathtaking. There were also far more loungers than ever needed. The beach has suffered from some of the erosion problems but it doesnt effect your enjoyment of it. The service. Absolutely unbelievable!! I have read a few reviews in the past that have complained of waiting around for waiter service etc and all i can say is that these people probably should get off their lazy backsides and get there own drinks. The staff work very very hard and always seem to do so with a smile on their faces delivering what i can only call a great level of service. At the poolside waiters come round every hour or so taking drinks orders and then returning shortly later with your drinks. In the lobby bar they are so efficient that when they see your drink is NEARLY finished they will ask \"same again?\" and be back before your drink is finished. One night whilst watching the entertainment I got very drunk beacause i had no idea how many drinks i had due to me not needing to leave my seat. I would also like to point out that although I do tip a bit I very rarely tip waiters so was not recieving any special level of service. The service from every single member of staff was always top notch but it is easier to find examples from the waiters. Also I was very surprised by just how much english the staff spoke, when i am on holiday i enjoy \"trying\" to speak their native tongue but found this wasn't a bit necesary most of the time The Food. The food was the only thing that to me occasionally let me down this was primarily due to some foods not being kept warm enough (in the buffet). Other than that one complaint I found the food to be well varied and prepared to a very high standard. We ate in two of the speciality resteraunts, Myagi (japenese, duh) and La Bodega (Brazilian). Both were excellent and again the service was superb. From 11am to 11pm you can order room service which will always be delivered within 10 minutes or so. This was a great service that we took advantage of from time to time. The wedding day. Well I know that i am going to be a bit biased but it was perfect, we got married at 2pm in the Gazebo, It was a boiling hot, clear day. We had hired a harpist to play at the ceremony and we found that to be one of our better decisions. The wedding coordinators were very good and helped to ensure everything went smoothly, The flowers were beautiful, the ceremony was pleasant and the reception dinner was very nice (La Bodega) All of our guests enjoyed every part of the day but most importantly so did my wife and I.

Third day there we went to the beach in the morning to chill on the beach, at about 1pm I went back to the room to take the camera back, to my surprise there were two male maids in the room.

After getting back to the room at like 4pm I went to take another and noticed that half my pain meds were missing from the bottle. I had only taken one from that bottle and there were only 3 left. The bag of about ten bottles of different meds were in a zip lock bag in the nitestand next to the bed. After talking to mgt. about the problem they said they would talk to the guys who did our room, Imagine this... they had no idea what we were talking about!

The beach and pool area are amazing. The water and grounds are incredible but the service not good. There were 6 of traveling. Check in was at 3p. 2 arrived at 1 the day before were let immediately into their room. When the rest arrived the next day at 1p they were told that there were no exceptions to early check in, even though our friends checked in with no problems. When asked for a hospitality room to change in and store our luggage we were directed to what turned out to be a bathroom to change in and had no option other than to leave our luggage in the lobby. When returning 5 hours later our luggage, thankfully, was still there, but no bellman had bothered to take it our rooms. I guess they were upset with us asking for a early check in and clean private place to change. Actual Check in - 6 ladies traveling together, placed on the ground floor which most travelers know is not advisable for women. When we requested a room change we were told by the manager that there were absolutely no rooms available until the next day. Ironically, one of the girls returned to her room later to find a picture had fallen off the wall and there was glass everywhere - the manager did find her a new room. The next day - only 1 room was available but when we walked around the adjoining rooms had no guests and it was well after 3p - the rooms were open as the maids were still cleaning up. Dinner had to be reserved day of for any of the restaurants and only between the hours of 830-10a. If you were not in line by at least 8a you always ended up with the last seating which was 9p. Very inconvenient. Maid service - one of the gals had her cigarettes stolen not once but twice - the 1st time she thought it may had been a mistake but the 2nd time clearly not and when she questioned the maids about it they denied it, however, my friend found her cigarettes on their cart! Another gal had her tweezers and faux diamond earrlngs come up missing. Many complaints to the manager fell on a deaf ear. They could care less. Kudos to the gal named Kate at the front desk, she was the only one who seemed to care and really try to get things fixed, however it was her manager who never actually came through.

I\u2019m hoping that writing this trip report will give valuable guidance for future travelers. I hope this is not too long or too boring. It was a different type of vacation for us, in the sense that it was at a resort and the main purpose of our trip was to attend a wedding. Both of us had never been to this country before. How it was booked \u2013 Usually I book our vacations ourselves to save us money. This time I decided to go through a travel agency \u2013 Liberty Travel. I shopped around for the best deal, though. If we would have gone through the bride\u2019s travel agent, the exact same package would have cost 300 dollars more. The trip that was bought included round trip airfare to Cancun from Philadelphia, 4 nights and 5 days at the Riu Palace Mexico in Playacar on an all-inclusive basis and transfers from airport to hotel. It was great to have our transport, stay and even our food taken care of. I had travel insurance added in, in the event of a storm, since it was hurricane season also. Luckily, this was a quiet year as far as hurricanes go so this was never an issue. I have only one complaint about this process and that was the travel agent\u2019s knowledge of the ever-changing passport rules. I have a passport, but it is in my maiden name. I asked her if I could use it in conjunction with a marriage certificate and have plane ticket in married and she said OK. But then when we got to the airport, the tickets were changed to reflect my maiden name. I am a proud married woman \u2013 I don\u2019t like to travel in my maiden name. Looking back I would have requested a new passport instead of dealing with the hassle. Where we stayed \u2013 The Riu Palace Mexico in Playacar was good. This was a change of pace for us since we usually stay in simple accommodations. We had room 145 and our veranda looked out on the manicured lawns. The resort has a wild feel to it \u2013 on our first day we spotted a capybara on the grass. The workers take care of this resort very well. In addition I liked not having to do research on food like I do on other trips. I had mixed feelings about the resort \u2013 while the resort was great, it didn\u2019t give us a true taste of Mexico and we were very sheltered. We decided to take a few side trips to accomplish this. The frustrating thing at the resort is that there was never a concrete list of what was included. For example, I could borrow a windsurf for free but in order to learn how to use it, we needed to pay. When we were checking out, we were charged for making calls to Dolphin Discovery for a shuttle. We thought that it would be included since it was a local call. So be careful about any phone calls you need to make \u2013 local and otherwise. How we got there \u2013 Our package included RT air from Useless Air (AKA US Air). This was my first trip with this airline. I did not care for the constant credit card shilling on board. Perhaps I am spoiled by the no-frills attitude from Southwest Air. Otherwise the flights were good. Healthy in Mexico? \u2013 I had read the stories about getting sick in Mexico due to the water. I was nervous due to the fact I suffer from IBS and I need to very careful with what I consume and drink. I think I went a little overboard \u2013 we brought jugs of Philly water with us. In the end, however, I did get sick on the last day but this was probably due to drinking soda of all things. My illness was short-lived, though. Here are the details: Day 1 \u2013 Oct 4 \u2013 Vamos a Mexico! Our trip did not get out to the best of starts. The flight was to be at 10 a.m. so I wanted us to be at the airport at 7 a.m. We usually get a lift from my mother-in-law, which we are very grateful for. Unfortunately, my husband gave her the wrong dates and we found ourselves rushing to the airport. Luckily there was no one at the US Air Intl Terminal by the time we got there and checked in time. Our flight took off and landed without incident \u2013yes! As it was not a fully booked flight, we had plenty of comfort aboard. Perhaps it\u2019s a wise idea to leave mid-week. Upon arrival we went through immigration and customs smoothly. I was so happy to see our luggage even though the one suitcase got broken somewhere along. The next step was finding our transfer, which was with Olympus Tours. I had received many warnings that we would be approached with time-share hawkers and boy, are they out there! Be careful! Despite the fact I warned my husband, we still almost got sucked in. We eventually found the transfer and we were on our way south to Playacar. Our room in the Riu Palace was not ready when we arrived so we took some time to take in our surroundings. We were instantly greeted with juice as a welcome. We were very happy with this since we were starved- apparently US Air does not give much food on their flights. This was a low-key first day since it was arrival day. We checked in with the bride and the groom, chilled out at the resort and called Dolphin Discovery to get a van transfer for the following day. We spent the night watching the baseball playoffs in Spanish. Our first time at the buffet happened to be Mexican night. I wanted to try cuisine that was close to traditional Mexican so I tried the chicken with mole sauce. Other foods were available, too. The first meal at the resort was a foreshadow of the all-inclusive plan, BTW. My husband asked for a wine and the waiter proceeded to put an entire bottle on the table. Day 2 \u2013 Oct 5 \u2013 They Call Her Izamal\u2026Izamal! This day\u2019s activities combined local sight-seeing and some family obligations. At the start of every day, we had a big breakfast at the buffet. Usually I had banana juice with a crunchy fried donut type of thing. I was never able to find out what this was but I believed that it was a native Mexican breakfast dish. Anybody know what this is? The hubby tried too many things I can\u2019t even remember. I had read that in the Mexican Riviera you could swim with dolphins. Prior to us leaving, I booked a Dolphin Encounter for us at Dolphin Discovery at nearby Puerto Adventuras. Cost of this for two was about $160. The transfer picked us up and proceeded to take us there after picking up several other passengers. The website for the place claimed it cost money to take the shuttle but we were never charged. During the transfer, it was obvious that the proprietors have taken US commercialism to an art form. They were advertising the DVD and photo sales before we even got there. Although the time was relatively short, we had great time interacting with our dolphin Izamal. This may be our only chance to engage such intelligent creatures in real life. We found the Encounter to be the best bet for those on a budget. In the other programs you seemed to pay a lot more for only an additional 15 minutes. I don\u2019t like places where you can\u2019t take pictures (they want to sell you the pictures and DVD of course) but we wound up buying two and two frames for about $40 US. There were other creatures to see, however. They had four manatees, stingrays, three toed sloths and macaws also. We took the shuttle back to the resort and proceeded to eat lunch. After lunch, we took some time to lounge at the beach. The water was extremely warm and this is coming from someone who\u2019s traveled all over. Then a small rain storm came in. It rained every day we were there but it didn\u2019t ruin the trip. That night, my husband and I attended the rehearsal dinner for my cousin-in-law\u2019s wedding the next day. This was the night that we started our experimentation with cocktails \u2013 after all, they were free! Over the course of the trip, my husband tried out a blue lagoon, a pina colada, gin and tonic, margarita and Kahlua and cream. One of our favorite memories was sitting in the hot tub with a drink in hand. I found a new favorite drink while down there \u2013 Kahlua and cream! Day 3 \u2013 Oct 6 Here Comes the Bride (and Here Comes the Rain) Today was wedding day so we decided to stay at the resort. After our usual breakfast, we headed out for some shopping at the mall that was a short walk away. I am careful about spending money for souvenirs but once I saw the carved elephants, I surrendered. Since we are big tea drinkers, my husband picked up a couple mugs. We had no problems using our Visa card from home and used American $ as currency. After shopping, we discovered the maid had left a towel elephant for us in our room. As I love elephants (see above), I was very excited. I was disappointed I couldn\u2019t take the towel animal with me. A total of 3 towel animals were left: a swan, the elephant and a peacock. We then spent time at the beach, the pool and the hot tub while having lunch in between. I had wanted to try windsurfing, but we found out that lessons for beginners would cost 85 American $. We decided to spend this money instead on visiting ruins the next day instead We got changed for the outdoor afternoon wedding in the gazebo. I feel we dressed appropriately thanks to the guidance on this site. I wore a skirt and sandals and he wore a golf shirt and long khaki pants. The wedding was lovely although rain caused a brief delay. The workers organizing the wedding seemed to have a lot of patience regarding the rain. A few select family and friends made it down for the bride and groom. In reality, there were more attendees at the wedding because resort guests got to watch the wedding, too. My cousin-in-law, the bride, wore the traditional white dress and cried throughout. The bridesmaids wore short dresses from Ann Taylor and the groomsmen wore slacks and casual white shirts with no ties. After the wedding, dinner was held at the restaurant Sir Edward. The choice was between steak and red snapper. I remembered the desserts the most \u2013 traditional cake was served along with various fruits in a glaze. Good fun was had by all. It was great spending time with this side of the family we usually don\u2019t see. Day 4 \u2013 Oct 7 \u2013 Hi Ho It\u2019s Off to Tulum We Go! First things first: We had breakfast and made dinner reservations at the Japanese restaurant. This was, alas, our last full day. We chose this day to be another exploration of the outside area. This was a fun because we felt we saw more of the \u201creal\u201d Mexico. We chose to visit the Mayan ruins at Tulum. There were many ways to get there. Colectivo, taxi, tour or renting a car were options. Ultimately, we decided to take a taxi. We liked this because we got to interact with a local and he knew where he was going. We were excited because the driver knew of my favorite baseball team \u2013the Phillies- back home and its home run hitter Ryan Howard. The taxi cost us 80 American $ round-trip though we paid him in pesos. The taxi option was good because we could come and go as we pleased. When we got there, they had shuttles to the ruins site for a few pesos each. We took this shuttle only to discover that we could have walked the distance for free and with little effort. Admission to the ruins was about 8 American $ for the two of us. It was extremely hot at the ruins. I would strongly recommend that you bring plenty of water and sunscreen/hat. In retrospect I would have brought our swimsuits since the ruins face the sea and we could have gone swimming right there! The ruins themselves, though, were spectacular and were one of the highlights of our trip. Although I had seen pictures of these ruins before I left, my husband had not and was blown away the first time he saw them. My husband and I are fascinated by history and took great time reading every card. The ruins were also full of wildlife \u2013 the local residents here are iguanas! The taxi brought us back to the resort. Unfortunately, this was around the time that I got sick. It didn\u2019t damper our trip as much because all of our major activities were out of the way. So all we did the rest of this day was lounge around. Problems arose when I was looking forward to having Japanese cuisine for the first time and I was too sick to really enjoy it! Later, I missed out on going to the disco with my husband. I spent the night packing and watching the Formula One Japanese Grand Prix auto race in Spanish. Day 5 \u2013 Oct 8 \u2013 It\u2019s Time to Go Home and Watch Some Football Our flight home was scheduled at 9:30 in the morning. I scheduled it this way so we could be back in time for a football game. With the flight leaving this early, we needed to leave the resort by 6 a.m. It was hard to get up but we did it. Thank goodness I had packed the night before. My husband had smuggled in some pizza from the buffet the night before and we had this as our breakfast. The bartender gave us some orange juice also. Our transfer company -Olympus Tours brought us to Cancun airport in time \u2013 in pouring rain. There was some effort trying to find the Useless Air check-in but once we found it we were good to go. We bought two big bottles of Kahlua at duty-free along with a few last minute souvenirs. Our flight took and off and landed without incident \u2013 thank God. The baggage made it to us in Philly as well \u2013 hoorah! Getting through immigration and customs was smooth.

Months of tripadvisor reviews filled my head prior to arrival, and this is what we experienced first hand: PROPERTY- beautiful, one of the cleanest I've stayed at, nicely laid out & very elegant. BEACH- gorgeous sand & palm tree area, but they most definitely have some serious beach erosion issues going on. We came out one morning and approx 12 ft of beachfront was gone. You had to use a rope to climb down the 6ft embankment. Entering the ocean was rocky and risky. By the next morning, the rocks were covered with sand again & the workers had sloped the embankment so you could safely climb down to the water. The water is gorgeous, but they are losing beachfront rather quickly from what we observed. FOOD- our 1st time at an AI, and I was much more impressed than I expected. The buffet offers huge selections, with different themes nightly. We also tried Miyagi (great) and Bodega(okay). Sir Edwards got great reviews but we were never able to get a reservation despite standing in line for 20-30min on 2 different mornings. Don't forget that men must wear pants in the evening. -no exceptions, from what we experienced. POOL- yes, a little dated and not as big as the Riu Maya Riviera pool. The beach area of hammocks, sand & palm trees was so gorgeuos that it was not a big deal to us. Hopping with activity our week, but never rowdy. SERVICE- could not have been better. Very quick responses to our requests for egg crates (which do help the hard bed tremendously), water/beverage refills, room service, etc. They also made every effort to get us courtyard rooms, but we got so settled in our 2nd floor rooms in the south buildings we decided to stay put.

We were there for seven days and had a great time although we did experience some issues. My mom had a small Christmas pin stolen. She didn't think to put it in the safe because it was no more than $5. I had one diamond (it was a CZ so not a huge deal) stolen. I understand that the safe is there for a reason, however you just don't expect to have to put EVERYTHING in it. Be aware. We had a hard time getting towels. Many times we would call and call and never receive the towels. We figured out that taking a stack of towels off the maid carts in the hall was the best bet. We did have to hide them in the drawers or they would take them back. Many times our rooms weren't cleaned until after 4 pm. Flip a coin on the turn down service. My parents room was turned down each night, ours wasn't. The pools are small, but the bonus was that we didn't have any issues finding a spot at the pool. This was a major problem at the other properties primarly b/c the Riu Tequila is not on the beach so many people would come to the Playacar. Although you can visit the other resorts..those staying at those same resorts are not allowed in the Palace. We did walk up to the other Palace resort, it took us about 15 minutes. It had a much bigger,nicer pool area but it was totally packed with kids. It was a bit more quiet at the RPM. The food was typical all inclusive food. Some things were just plain bad and I am not picky. I have been to many,many all inclusives and I was just disappointed. Another issue was the fact that MEN MUST WEAR PANTS TO ALL DINNER MEALS. This was fine with us but it was not consistent at all. On the first night, my husband was told that he could not come in with shorts on. I just assumed that we could slip by due to experiences at nicer resorts. It wasn't a huge deal but later that night and throughout the week we noticed that other men were allowed in with shorts. We also experienced rude waiters. One let us know what time the buffet would be closing and stated that we only had 10 minutes to eat when the buffet didn't close for another 30 minutes. We had a very nice, relaxing time. However, this was a fairly expensive trip due to the time of the year (December 06), so we did have certain expectations that just weren't met. I did let the front desk know about the problems we experienced.

My husband and I took our 18 year old daughter and found everything absolutely wonderful! Some of the reviews that I read made me a little apprehensive, but we really could not find fault with anything. Our room was immaculate- I had asked the travel agent for a quiet room and it was. The breakfasts were unbelievable-something for everyone- yogurt, fruit, smoothees, omelets, french toast, donuts, etc... My daughter and I enjoyed their tortilla chips and guacamole for lunch each day. We ate at Sir Edward one night- it was nice, but preferred the buffet as it really had something for everyone plus we enjoyed eating outside. I was wary of the beds, but we all found them to be firm and we slept very well on them. The service of the staff was impeccable. We did tip, but I found the service to be good whether you tipped or not. I checked out the other Rius while we were there and liked ours the best. We took an excursion to Tulum to see the ruins and then to Xel-Ha- a natural park where we snorkeled. Tulum was interesting and added some history- not for little ones though- too hot and lots of walking. The park was more for little ones- we liked it enough but it was crowded and it was nice to get back to the Riu. My daughter and I went shopping in Playa del Carmen early one evening and it was just okay. ( ten minute cab ride $5) - did have Starbucks there. We really liked the shopping plaza right down from the hotel better and we could walk there in five minutes and use the internet cheaper than at the hotel as well as a pay phone with no fees for the $20 calling card we bought at the hotel. I think this is a nice hotel for families as well as couples or teens. The beach was crowded so we sat around the pool and walked to the beach for a dip. Put your towel on chairs early in the day or you won't get one. It seems rude, but it is the way it is done there. I did water aerobics one day and it was not for old ladies- there were situps on the edge and it was a good workout.

Our room was on the first level with a view of the left yard of the resort, we aksed for a better room but were told none was availble, with 5 rooms needed that would have been difficult. We were not planning on being in room that much anyway. Over all we thought all the food was great our only complaint was the reservation method. We ate at the steack house and Rodizio both with a 9ish reservation we were like the only ones there. Enjoyed them both very much. We went to beach and pool bar everyday. The beach was having problems due to mother nature palm tress fell as we were there. Everyday the beach became smaller. We would have loved for the pool bar and area to stay open longer. 5 for swim up bar and 6 for pool we thought that was very early. We did walk one night across the street to disco all there wee very young 16 if that. We are a fun group who would of like alittle more excitement in the evening. We toook taxi to Play adn ferry to Cozumel that was very nice. We did do one excursion which I believe we could have gotten alot cheaper out of resort. The excursion was ro Xe-Ha (spelling).

I had spent weeks watching these reviews and was worried that I would be disappointed as my expectations were quite high. After a very long 11 hour flight from Gatwick, we were exhausted when we reached the hotel. But check-in was so easy, we were given drink whilst they allocated out rooms. I had emailed to request courtyard view rooms and to let them know we were celebrating my friends 50th Birthday. But unfortunately although I had had several replies from them they did not know anything when we got there. Nevertheless we were given excellent rooms (2045 facing the fountains near the pool end and 2049 top floor sea view!). Being at the far end of the hotel meant we had very little noise from other guests. The hotel is exactly as sold and I don\u2019t need to repeat all the previous wonderful reviews. Our rooms were big and pleasantly cool at all times. The bed was 2 doubles pushed together and very comfortable (even without pads), the bathroom was clean and shower hot (but dark!). I would take my own hairdryer next time as having one in the bathroom meant it got really hot and damp (and played havoc with the hairstyle girls!). We spent most days on the beach, grabbing beds early (7.30am some days) and staying there until we became surrounded by the spring breakers who seemed to be able to squeeze a bed in every single spot until you were surrounded. We then up-rooted and went further back into the quieter area amongst the palm trees and stayed until the sun went down (6pm). We would get cocktails and Corona from the Beach bar (or occasionally a waiter came along with a large tray of drinks). 2nd week, when the teenagers left, we went around the pool more and it was great cooling off standing in the pool bar. The pool has two side\u2019s one is quieter and deeper for swimming and relaxing; the other has the water polo net and the swim-up Bar and is more for socialising. Food was excellent, we had no problems booking all the different speciality Restaurants (if you went down late you just asked where they had spaces). We easily booked Sir Edwards (gourmet) for the Birthday Celebrations and they made a real fuss, decorating the table and doing a cake etc. (Thank you Brittany!). They also delivered flowers and champagne to my friend\u2019s room on the morning of her birthday and filled it with ballons! Entertainment was ok! (Not great!), but it was lovely to sit in the courtyard and listen to the band later on after the \u2018show\u2019. The Piano Bar was very \u2018civilised\u2019 and we enjoyed sitting there, except when the Spring breakers took over just before they went out clubbing\u2026..and even worse when they got back! We went into Playa Del Carmen a few times and had drinks at Blue Parrot (worth a visit!). Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone from England, as the standard is way higher than we are used to in the majority of European resorts.

My husband did a lot of research on what resort to stay at and this one was chosen partly due to what he read on Trip Advisor. I will start with the positive. Let me say first that the hotel is very nice; grounds are beautiful and well kept. The rooms are 2 double beds pushed together but we knew that when making our reservations. The beds are hard but didn\u2019t keep us from sleeping. We did ask for mattress pads but the resort was fully booked that week so there were no mattresses available. The rooms had a musty smell after a few days but that is expected being on the water. We had a scented candle which helped. The staff was very nice and accommodating. Whether at the pool, on the patio, or in the lobby bar, there was always a waiter/waitress there to fill your glass. We never had any trouble with weak drinks. We had thermal mugs and used those for water or drinks. They don\u2019t mind at all making drinks in your mugs. The beach was great and really never had any trouble getting chairs. The pool was a little harder getting chairs but it always seemed to work out for us. The pools are on the small side but the pool opposite the bar was almost always empty and quiet. Food on the most part was good. There is a lot to choose from on the buffet. Entertainment was fine. There was a band every night in the courtyard and it was enjoyable sitting outside having a drink listening to music. Down side were definitely the spring breakers. I would never go again in March. These kids were out of control. They were with their parents but they might as well not have been as the parents didn\u2019t really care what they did. They took over the pool bar every day and the lobby bar in the evening. If you went to the lobby bar before dinner you were ok but after nine it was hard to get a table. For a hotel that advertises no spring breakers we were very surprised. We were always woken up between 3-4AM with the kids coming down the hall screaming, yelling, throwing things on the walls and doors. Very annoying. The specialty restaurants were good except the steak house if you are eating steak, which was very chewy. The tuna I understand was great. The process of making reservations is a hassle and after 2 days we just slept in and took our chances. We were able to try all 4 of them so it worked out.

These kids were out of control and seemed to overtake the entire facility from the beach, to the pool bar, to the main bar there was no where the 4 of us could go to escape them.

We have been to several all-inclusives, including Sandals in Jamaica and Occidental Grand in Aruba. We have also been to luxury non-all inclusive resorts, such as the Westin in Maui and the Grand Hyatt in Kaua'i. Based on our travel experience, I believe that we're in a good position to give an unbiased review of this all-inclusive resort. We stayed at the Riu Palace Mexico from March 17 - 24. As many people have previously noted on tripadvisor, the grounds are immaculate. (see pictures) The courtyard is filled with fountains, flowers and manicured shrubs. The hotel itself is beautiful - yellow with black wrought iron balconies and terracotta roof tops. It truly feels like you're staying in a palace. Our room, 1125, was very nice. We didn't have any issues with mold. Our bathtub was perfectly clean as well. The daily cleaning service was adequate, with only one exception - the floors always felt sitcky. We had to walk around the room in flip-flops. The only other problem was that the Wyndham Viva Maya had a disco playing loud music very close to our window until 2 am. We didn't have a problem because we were out pretty late ourselves on most night. By the time we returned to the room, we were so tired that the music didn't keep us up. But for those that prefer quiet, stay away from this side of the hotel. Stay on the side that borders Riu Yucutan. Also, as others have mentioned, the hotel door lets in a lot of noise. So if you want to sleep in, I would definitely consider some ear plugs. The service at the Riu Palace was great. The waitstaff was super-friendly. Roy, Oniver, Raul and Abel are very fun and friendly waiters. We threw a few bucks their way, and they greatly appreciated it. They make $25/day, so even a buck or two is significant for them. The food was very good. To address the complaint that other people have posted on tripadvisor regarding lack of food choices, I completely disagree. I really don't know what else they could have incorporated into their buffets and restaurants in order to ensure that people would not bored with the food choices. I think the people that have said this simply chose not to try different things. It is difficult to describe the amount of food they offered, but I will try. Every breakfast lunch and dinner they had one whole buffet table of deli cuts and cheeses as well as a salad bar with several dressings. For breakfast, they offered an omlette station, a waffle and pancake station, a smoothie station, and a doughnut station. They also had hard-boiled eggs, hash browns, flambe, bacon, sausage, 10 - 15 different cereals, a fruit bar, a table with 10+ different freshly baked breads and a table dedicated to pastries. For lunch, they had three different restaurants open offering everything you could possibly want, including fajitas, hamburgers, pizza, french fries, rice, chicken, fried calmari, soup, freshly baked tortilla chips with gucamole and pico di galo. At dinner, if you didn't chose one of 4 a la carte restaurants, they had even more food at the buffet than was offered for the breakfast and lunch. Honestly, I don't know how anyone could even begin to complain about the food! The a la carte restaurants were all really good. If you can manage to get up early enough to make a reservation, I suggest that you try them. La Bodega had really good food, but there was way too much of it. Miyagi, the Japanese restaurant was decent. The dessert was fabulous at Miyagi. Try the ice cream tempura and the deep fried banana egg roll. The steak house was no Ruths Chris, but it was decent. We asked for a medium-rare steak and this is exactly what we got. Unfortunately, we didn't get a chance to eat at Sir Edward's, the gourmet restaurant. We ended up eating at the Glass Bar in Playa Del Carmen instead, which was fantastic! If you feel like leaving the resort for dinner one night, I highly recommend this place. Ask to sit outside and you can people watch as you're served your phenomenal yet resonably priced meal. The bar was premium, for the most part. They had several choices for vodka, gin, rum and tequila. We found that it's best to specify which one you want. If you don't specify, they may use a generic brand. Also, having a bar in your room is a definite plus. You can pour yourself a cocktail and enjoy the view on your balcony. The nightly entertainment was very decent also. Nevertheless, we got a little bored staying at the resort. After the 9:45 show, many people headed for their rooms. The band would play for another 15 minutes or so before calling it a night. The only place that's open after 10:00 pm is the bar in the lobby. (see picture) There is also a disco across the street at the Riu Tequila, but it was filled with high school kids, so we felt really out of place. We went out to Playa Del Carmen on a few of the nights. It's only a $5 cab ride away, and is very beautiful. We were blown away by the restaurants, bars and shops. The cobble stone streets, that have only pedestrian traffic offer a great atmosphere. The pool was decent and we found ourselves there in the afternoon, after the wind would pick up on the beach. The water was cold for the first couple of days, but became warmer towards the latter part of the week. It wasn't too loud by the pool. Music was only played by the pool during water aerobics. The beach was by far our biggest disappointment. On the first day, there was about a 1 foot drop down to the water. (see picture) But by the third day, the beach had eroded and had a drop of around 4 - 5 feet. (see picture). The beaches to the left of the hotel were in even worse shape. So places like the Royal Hideaway, Riu Playacar, Wyndham Viva Maya, Riu Riviera Maya, and Occidental had virtually no beach. They're currently trying to fix those beaches, so there are a bunch of sand bags and hoses on the beach, which look horrible. Not to mention it's very difficult to enter the water with those obstacles in the way. We spoke to some people who mentioned that this beach has eroded 60 meters in the past two years! Since we love the beach, we wouldn't come back unless this problem was corrected. As one of the more recent posters mentioned, we also found that there were too many spring breakers at the resort during our stay. Many people were disappointed with this. Some of the kids were okay, while others were rude and discrespectful. Some of the guests we spoke to heard them running down corridors in the middle of the night and banging on doors. We felt that they had no business staying at this resort. They should have stayed across the street at the Riu Tequila, where the hotel promotes a party atmosphere.

The grounds were beautiful, and impeccably cared for. The hotel was incredibly clean. It was especially breath-taking at night when the fountains were all lit up. Our room did not face the courtyard and I would request a room that does because the resort is so pretty and those rooms offer a much better view. The staff was very helpful and the few times we ordered anything to the room someone was there in minutes. The day we got there we had some mosquitoes in our room and they quickly brought bug spray and we didn't have a problem for the rest of the week. Our room was spacious and clean, the shower was awesome, but the beds were definitely hard and they had run out of mattress pads so we had to deal without them. We never had a problem getting chairs at the pool or beach, though we preferred the pool because there are drink waiters there that come around frequently and at the beach you have to go to the bar. The food was fine. Being from NYC and somewhat of a food snob it was nothing to write home about but it was never bad and there was TONS of variety. Breakfast was especially good and they always had fresh salad ingredients and a wide assortment of cheese, to my delight. The entertainment at night was light and amusing, and every night there was a band in the piazza that provided a great background for cocktails. We had drinks out there every night of our trip, and a waiter was ALWAYS right there asking if we needed another. The only time we did not have perfect service was at El Patio and in the main buffet area where we sometimes had to get our own silver-ware and repeatedly ask for drinks, but it was quite crowded when we were there due to school spring break and I think the waiters were overwhelmed. There were tons of high schoolers the week we were there but they never caused any problems for us or kept us up at night. As a couple in our mid-twenties, we were basically the only two in our age group at the resort; lots of families, chaperoned high school trips, and elderly couples, but we didn't care. The hotel had the best atmosphere, it was so relaxed, and the staff was so pleasant that we just hung out and opted not to party late at night, though plenty of people did. The Riu Tequila right across the street had a night club and sportsbar that were open late if you like to go out. The Riu Palace had the biggest beach of any of the other hotels we saw. We also really liked that there were 5 other resorts we could go to for drinks and walk around, it was nice to be able to explore and not feel stuck in one place. I would highly recommend both our hotel and the area in general. Playa del Carmen was a charming town and fun to walk around, and a nice 20 minute walk from our hotel. We ate at a delicious restaurant called Casa del Agua for my boyfriend's birthday, at the hotel's recommendation, and it was perfect. We did two excursions, one to Xel-Ha and then an ATV jungle tour, and both were SO fun and easily booked through the hotel.

We had an amazing time!!! The good: Upon arriving at the palace you were immediately impressed by the beauty and elegance of the place. The staff that greeted us at the hotel were very friendly. Our room was more than comfortable and we ended up with a garden view room instead of a courtyard and this worked out to our advantage because it was quieter. The bar was fully stocked, so you had access to bottled water, beer and pop whenever you needed some. The food was GREAT. We've been to other resorts in Cuba and the Dominican and to be honest of course there are some repeats but the RIU palace mexico staff made an effort to keep things as creative as they could. Each night at the buffet was themed and so you could get a variety of foods that way. We didn't bother with the specialty restaurants because we preferred to have more variety of choice for our meals. Finally, the beach.... it was beautiful and because it's so long and wide you could always find shade and a lounger. The only concern is that in the 7 days we were there the shoreline went from flat to a drop off mini-cliff (a meter or two), poor palm trees were falling down :( That doesn't mean there isn't a good beach - you can walk to the right of the hotel and there is tons of beach but it's something to note. THE BAD: There are only 2 complaints that my husband and I had regarding this hotel. 1) NOISE, the way the hotel is built there is a lot of echo from the halls. The cleaning staff start early and they are talking rather loudly which is magnified by the structural design of the hallways. It's not the end of the world, but my hubby and I used earplugs and they helped. We were there when the spring breakers were as well and they were obnoxious and drunk most of the time, luckily they are not a staple of the hotel. 2) ON the day of arrival we had an early start from Toronto and by the time we got to the hotel with our delayed flight and waiting at the airport for an hour (another passenger got lost), we were tired. We had to wait a while for our room, we got there at around 11:30am and waited until ~2:30pm. If possible it would have been nice to get a room earlier, rest and settle in. Overall, we had a BLAST.

If you like high school & college kids getting drunk and making so much noise that you can't sleep, you'll like this hotel. The beds are hard, but not bad. What is bad is that they are 2 doubles pushed together, so good luck sleeping in the same bed with your significant other. Drinks are served very weak and in small servings. Bring your own container if you plan to relax on the beach with a cool drink. The bartenders will rinse and fill your thermal cup with whatever you'd like so you don't have to run to the bar every 10 minutes. Also there are no food or drink servers on the beach. If you want bottled water or soda, take it with you from your mini fridge. If you'd like room service, make sure you find your order form that is hidden in the drawer and decide what you want before you go to bed. If you decide when you wake up, that you want breakfast brought to you, good luck. At 9am we were that we could order lunch...too late for breakfast. The room service menu is limited and you'll need to brush up on your Spanish if you call in your order. The towels are in poor shape, and the couch in the room had mildew stains on it. The specialty restaurants were ok, the servers were wonderful and very nice, but not worth the hassle of waiting in line at 8:30 in the morning to make a 9pm dinner reservation. I was ok wearing long pants to dinner, and my wife looked very stunning dressed up as well, but beware, the table next to you may have girls wearing short shorts that say \"Pink\" or \"Juicy\" on them with a tank top. Very trashy, and couldn't understand why they didn't enforce the way girls dressed at dinner. Again, beach, food, service, hotel, courtyard, very nice...drunk kids all over the place, not so nice. If you\u2019re going to advertise \"NO SPRING BREAKERS\", then stand behind it. When you're spending thousands of dollars on vacation, you should be able to enjoy it. P.S. When my wife tried to let mgmt. know about the complaint we had about the spring breakers, they told us to write it on trip advisor, so here we are. We hope this helps you in choosing your next vacation. ***A suggestion for the hotel that allows the young spring breakers: since these kids want everyone to know how much fun they are having, put them in a designated section of the hotel so the other people can enjoy their vacation too.", "Date": "March 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "boston, ma", "Title": "\u201cOur Report Card On the Riu Palace Mexico\u201d", "Author": "campinptown", "ReviewID": "UR7217990", "Content": "My wife and I planned our vacation over the past few months and decided on Mexico. We used TripAdvisor to make our decision like we had in the past. After much debate we decided on the Riu Palace Mexico for the week of 3.10.07-3.17.07 and here is our report card. Location: \"A\" The hotel was located in the gated area known as Playacar which was within walking distance to downtown Playa Del Carmen haivng a small shopping area and we felt very safe. Hotel: \"C\" Upon arrival we were graciously welcomed by Manuel the doorman who was so nice to us during our stay making us feel at home. He makes the hotel and we would give him an A for effort! Front desk \"C\" during check in very helpful but during our stay we called a few times for minor things such as a mattress pad taking almost 2 days after 3 calls. Room: \"B-\" since it was just average small complaints the bathroom light took over a minute to turn on, slight musty smell (which is common for the beach), and mold on the couch. We had one of the \"best rooms\" in the hotel yet there was no view of the ocean just of the fountains/pool area. Housekeeping: \"A-\" the room was cleaned everyday time did vary and the turndown service was a nice touch but not consistant. Grounds: \"A+\" the hotel grounds were some of the best we had seen in all of Playacar after visiting the nearby sister hotels. Food: \"B\" we realized what kind of food we would be getting after staying at other all inclusive hotels. There was always something to eat but we became bored with choices by the end of the week. Reservations to the specialty restaurants ;F since it took so much effort to make plans for dinner. We chose to eat there one night at the steakhouse and were sat beside the salad bar. We did request another table but we were told no with many empty tables out under the veranda. Service :A the hotel staff were all so kind and helpful each trying their best to accomodate our needs. The pool waiters were constantly walking around offering cocktails etc. GYM/SPA: D we were very dissapointed in the facilities and lack of treatments available. Beach; B unfortunately mother nature has destroyed most of the beach it was cleaned everyday but we felt that all of the chairs were right on top of eachother. There was no glass that we saw in the sand. It did become annoying later in the day to hear the constant sound of jet skis and the parasailing boats racing up and down the beach. If you turned right you could walk a long distance down the beach which was nice however very dirty with trash and debris all over the place. Pool : C the pool was very weird and small. The side with the pool bar was kind of dirty and the water was very shallow...it came up to my knees in some parts with paper cups and straws floating in the water. The other side of the pool was less crowded but we found entrance/exit tricky since there was only 1 ladder available. Maintenance: D although the hotel was clean there were some issues with broken tiles, worn paint on the exterior of the buildings, missing artwork, broken lights in the hallways, room service trays left in the hallway for days. After a week of staying at the Riu Palace we did enjoy our time but were dissapointed after spending over $5000 for a week away. There was an issue with our flight on the way home and we were forced to sit infront of the hotel from 11am to 7pm. Again, Manuel could not have been nicer check in on us but the front desk staff would not make a local call for us since we did not have a cell phone or access to our room. Again we had spent quit a bit of money during the week and tipped the same people upon check in. We felt that the lack of concern/help would keep us from going back.", "Date": "March 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "colorado", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful resort....wonderful time, with a twist!\u201d", "Author": "deezerd22", "ReviewID": "UR7202654", "Content": "We stayed at the Riu Palace Mexico March 17-21. It is a beautiful resort-the grounds are immaculate, and there is daily evidence of the hard work the grounds crew and housekeeping do. The whole resort is gorgeous, and while it's not big it's certainly impressive. Our room was comfortable, though the beds are hard, and very clean. The place, as mentioned in previous reviews, is noisy. Bring your earplugs. There is a secondary door past the bathroom into the room-use it. Things start up early around there, and some people are noisy at night, and you will hear them. Could be disruptive to a light sleeper! There have been many questions about the beach. Well, it does have some issues. Just in the four days we were there the beach changed drastically, to the point that yesterday morning the grounds crew was transplanting palm trees further away from the breaking waves. When we first went to the beach there was not a drop-off. When we left, there was a huge one, and it happened literally overnight. The beach is still very viable, but you can tell it's a struggle to keep it up. While we were there we ate at the buffet as well as two of the specialty restaurants, the Rodizio and the Gourmet. Of the two, I would recommend the Gourmet. The buffet was good, especially on seafood night, and there was a huge assortment of food. One thing that this resort excels in over others is the salad fixins'. They do a great job at both lunch and dinner providing a wide variety of greens and other items with which to make a salad. That hasn't been the case everywhere we've stayed. Overall the food was very good, and no one in our party got sick or had issues from anything other than overeating! One warning. Though it says explicitly on many websites \"No Spring Breakers,\" we were inundated with them. And many were not great neighbors. There were several groups of kids, seemingly without parents, though we were told that they were lurking in the background somewhere (we saw a few who were more hungover than the kids!). Many of these kids were drinking huge amounts of alcohol, and paying the price. The behavior of many reflected very poorly on the group, and we were really waiting for something serious to happen to one of them (which we heard did happen the night we left). This put a damper on an otherwise wonderful long weekend at a beautiful resort that we would be happy to visit again someday.", "Date": "March 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lancashire", "Title": "\u201cAn Excellent All Inclusive Option\u201d", "Author": "DG330", "ReviewID": "UR7199421", "Content": "I have recently returned from this excellent all inclusive resort hotel. I chose the hotel as I had stayed in several RIU Palace hotels in Europe and have always been very pleased with the standards. The RIU Palace Mexico did not disappoint. All areas were spotlessly clean and the bedroom was cleaned throughly everyday with a turndown service in the evening with fresh towels if required. The food was excellent with a wide variety and themed evenings in the buffet restaurant. The option to eat in the 4 A La Carte restaurants without limit was a huge bonus, especially as we stayed for 2 weeks. The only drawback was having to queue up on the morning that you wished to dine in the A La Carte to get a number as they tables were reserved on a first come first served basis. They tell you can book from 8.30am, however in reality numbers are given out from approx 8.00am. These restaurants were all wonderful,especially the Japanese and the Gourmet. There was never any problem having as many drinks as you wanted-including wine with lunch and dinner, a choice was given here and the bottle left on the table. The only area that was disappointing was the beach, unforntunately it has become very narrow and therefore became very crowded. That said just behind the beach front the hotel has sunbeds set in a beach like area amoung palm trees which extends back towards the pool area. There are even hammocks here.! This area was always quite with plenty of beds available for late risers plus the benefit of the sea breeze.

We stayed there from March 10-March 17th and we had 4 children with us between the ages of 13-18. The place is beautiful as all the reviews stated and the beach was the best part of this resort along with the food. The beach is probably one of the nicest around. Some of the neighboring beaches have not fully recovered from the hurricanes and some of them have poor beach areas. I would highly recommend this resort to anyone who wants to have a top beach as one of their priorities. We were always able to get beach chairs close to the beach. We were not impressed with the pools at this resort, but we knew that ahead of time by the reviews and that was not a big concern to us. If you are wanting large pools, you may want to reconsider this property. The other Riu resorts had larger pools and the Riu Palace Playacar had a great pool, but not that nice of a beach. I think many of these resorts with nice pools may not have the best beaches, at least that is what we have experienced. We stayed at the Iberostar Pariso Maya 1 1/2 years ago and they had amazing pools, the best we have ever seen, but the beaches weren't as nice as the Riu Palace Mexico beach. The food was also another huge plus, the best we have ever had. We only ate at the buffet, since we have been to other all-inclusive resorts and have never found the speciality restaurants to be any good, so we stayed away from them and were very pleased with the food and their incredible staff! The buffet changed every night to a different theme dinner which was great, plus they also had the other basic food, like mexican, salad bar etc. They also had a chocolate fondou bar every night with fresh fruit which our kids loved. The mini bars in the room were always stocked with water bottles, pop and corona beer and you could get more of any of these items at any time. Our children had the room service many times, but as many of the reviews stated there isn't a huge selection, but at least it was offered and the food was good enough. Our kids loved the disco across the street at the Riu Tequila and went there every night. The only complaint we had was the noise on one side of the building(the north facing building, next to the Wyndam resort). The band at the Wyndam played very very loud music everynight from 11:00-3:00 a.m. and our first rooms were on that side and miserable to sleep there, even with ear plugs. We asked to be moved the next day, but they couldn't move us for 2 days to the other side of the resort, so we waited until then. (We were told by the front desk that many people want to move from this area, so there is a large demand of moving rooms). They did move us to an inside garden room on the south side which was very nice, but on the ground level. They usually want $30.00 per person per night for these rooms, which we wouldn't pay for since we had such a large group with us and it would have been so expensive, but they finally agreed not to charge us. We had rooms 0056 and 0057 inside garden view and my sister in law had room 0032 which faced the other building not the garden view, but was away from the band. This place is still very loud overall, so just beaware of that ahead of time and maybe bring some ear plugs if you are a light sleeper. I would recommend the 2nd or 3rd floors since you have less people traveling the hallways in the morning and night hours, but I still think it could be loud due to the tile floors etc. If you are looking for a king bed you will not find it at this resort. They are 2 double beds(large double beds) pushed together, but there is the space between the 2 beds that make it hard to sleep like a true king bed. The beds are very hard, which all beds are in Mexico, but we requested the egg carton mattress pads which we finally got after 4 days( We were not very happy with the front desk servie on getting this done, since we asked for these the first night we checked in (since we had read the reviews and knew we would need them). We were very surprised that this resort had so much to offer, but couldn't even have a standard king bed. Every other resort we have stayed in had king beds, so this was one thing I wish they could change. Overall, I would recommend this property and I would stay there again, but I know more now that I could request which room I would prefer to stay in.

I originally asked a couple of travel agents about adults only resorts but they were priced out of our range. We saw maybe 4 kids at this resort the entire time we were there and they weren't bothersome. And we spent much less!! We have never done an all-inclusive resort before and I wanted us to have a great time so I researched all the hotels on the Riviera Maya. It is much less commercialized than Cancun. The comments from others on tripadvisor.com's website swayed me from my original destination - Riu Palace Riviera Maya. I'm grateful to the other members for their honesty and candid pictures as we have yet to have a better vacation other than our honeymoon. We were there from March 2-6. Upon deplaning at the airport, we were pulled aside by a man who looked like he was from customs and started asking us questions about our transportation, etc. First, we thought he was customs, then just a helpful airport employee, then discovered he worked for Royal Haciendas (time-share). We were suckered into his spiel but ended up with $110 American dollars, free breakfast, our $20 deposit back and a deep sea fishing excursion for the two of us. The breakfast was fabulous and the 90 minute presentation was nice, but out of our price range and they took no for an answer without much fuss. If you have the time, I would advise trying one of these. We only lost 2 hours of our vacation and got cash to spend and a free fishing excursion which was lots of fun! We rented a car and I was very happy about that since we like to do things on our own time without much planning. The maps from Avis were not very descriptive so beware. That was the single discouraging thing about our trip, although easily overcome. The staff at the Riu were very gracious and gave us a wonderful cocktail upon check-in. I requested a courtyard room and a mattress pad as recommended by other tripadvisor.com members. The beds were very comfortable with the pad and had no problems sleeping. The refrigerator in our room could have been colder but there was no knob to change the setting, so our beverages were cool but not ice cold like we like them to be. We requested it to be fixed but I think that is just the way the refrigerators are there. We solved it very easily - Go down to the endless bars there and get a cold Corona on tap!!! Besides, it gets you out of your room and in the sun! The courtyard view was wonderful and we could hear the band playing in the evening from our balcony. We didn't go to sleep until 12:30 am every night so the band playing too late was not a problem. They usually finished up at 11 pm and we would go down to the beach and sit in the hammocks and watch the full moon while hearing the waves crashing in. Spectacular! The beach was definitely better than the Riu Riviera Maya and I was very glad we chose this resort over that one. We had their buffet lunch once and I liked our lunch at Don Julian (the buffet lunch by the courtyard at our hotel) much better. The food was wonderful and there was something for every palate. The two restaurants down by the beach were not as good as the Don Julian buffet but for a quick bite, they were satisfactory. One note of advisory - if you're bringing children, there are Europeans that go topless on the beach. We had two different women that were topless everyday out there. One was more discreet and away from the main walking area, the other was right by the pool. We went to one dinner at the Brazilian restaurant at the Riu. The reservation process was easy. I went down at 7:55 am to the reservation ticket area, got a number and ate breakfast at the buffet. Then at 8:30, I went back and got seating for 6:30pm that night. There are only two seatings, 6:30 and 8:30 at the restaurants. After we were seated, they invited us to the soup/salad buffet and then brought out the different kinds of meat on skewers. They gave a moderate portion but would give more if you requested. I believe we had 5 different kinds of meat, all good except for the turkey breast (a little dry). Then they have a dessert buffet if you're still hungry. It was a fun experience but we chose to eat at the Don Julian the rest of the time and were able to eat as much as we wanted and had many different choices to choose from each day. The only criticism was all the restaurants need to work on the chocolate desserts. The desserts were dry and lacked flavor. But don't let that deter you. By the time you get to dessert, you're so full that it really doesn't matter. We ended up eating the yummy ice cream they had. It was about all we could fit in after eating the buffet! We are very active people when we go on vacation, so the water sports were essential for us to have access to and to make it better, they were included!!! We went sailing twice which was phenomenal if you know how to, boogie boarding once with the wonderful waves that were crashing in one day, and signed up for a Discover scuba diving trip with the hotel after an exciting introduction to scuba in the pool. When we read the fine print, it said not to do it if you had any problems with the ear. My husband was still on an antibiotic from an ear infection and we decided to cancel the trip which they graciously refunded the money. The next time we go, we plan to get certified. It was exciting. A little about Tulum - we went one morning before the heat of the day and drove our car. It was neat to see, but we were very glad to have our own transportation, I can't imagine being stuck there all day with a bus group. On our way back, we stopped at Hidden Worlds cenote and went snorkeling in a cave. It was one of the most incredible experiences we have ever had. I am claustrophobic and get freaked out by dark places, but our guide was so cool and so informative that I didn't even worry. His name is very long and he said for us to call him \"the skinny guy\". If you are able to do this, ask for him, he is very nice and we tipped him afterward. Don't miss an experience like this! Shopping in Playa del Carmen was lots of fun and I wish we had more time to do it. The shopping the furthest south on 5th street was high end, then got cheaper (less costly) the further north you went. Also, the shopping on 10th street (one street west), although less populated, was even cheaper because they don't get as much foot traffic. Two tips - never pay the price they ask, always haggle and do not pay with Mexican money. The American dollar rules and they are much more willing to drop the price since they can hang on to the money until the exchange rate is high and get more Mexican money for it. I got a bunch of American Express travelers cheques and when I went to cash them, they give you mexican pesos, even at the hotel (watch the exchange rate, it's different everywhere). The next time I go, I'm taking U.S. dollars! We went to the Riu Tequila one night and stopped in the disco that they kept announcing at our hotel every night. Our hotel was much more subdued and laid back and the night ended at 11:00pm but the Riu Tequila was a very young crowd, very rowdy and a lot of pretty drunk people everywhere. A constant party. My husband and I are 39 and we have three children, ages 3,7 and 9. We were commenting on how we didn't quite fit with the majority of older elite crowd of our hotel, but definitely didn't fit with the the Riu Tequila crowd. We liked the higher-end architecture and feel of our hotel and were very comfortable with all of the people we met there. Not one of the people we spoke with was uppity or unfriendly. Just not rowdy and obnoxious. Overall, we had an absolutely amazing vacation and I would highly advise it.

This was our first time in Mexico and at this resort. We truly loved the resort. The Great Points: The resort staff are very attentive and friendly. The grounds to the resort are absolutely beautiful. We also found all the guests very friendly, and made friends with many people we encountered. The doorman's name is Manuel and gives high-fives to everyone. The lobby bar makes the best drinks. Elsewhere (pool bar, beach bar, etc.) you will find the drinks a bit on the week side, but it only takes one request of an additional shot of liquor to make the drinks better. The food quality at the restaurants is good - not exceptional, but good. The Don Julian restaurant serves buffet style for all meals and there you will find a large variety of food to choose from. While buffets can get old, you have the option to make reservations at four different \"sit-down\" restaurants (for dinner only). We only dined at two; Sir Edward's Gourmet restaurant and La Bodega the brazilian restaurant. While the wait staff was very attentive, and the food good, the service was EXTREMELY slow by American standards. Be prepared for a minimum of 2 or 2 1/2 hour dinners at these restaurants. All of the rooms are a short distance to the pool, beach and restaurants. We stayed in a suite, and it was beautiful room. Strange, though, that we had a desk in the suite, but no chair in the room. When we reported a missing chair, we were told that the desks do not have chairs, but we were given one in response to our requests. And yes, the beds mattresses are hard, but after long days, we hardly noticed. (Request a mattress pad - it does help a bit.) Pillows are hard too. The pool area is very nice and was never very crowded, although we checked out the pools at the Riu sister resorts (Tequila and Yucatan) and found the pools there to be much larger than Riu Palace. Riu Tequila and Riu Yucatan were also MUCH more crowded that Riu Palace, so we opted to stay put at our pool at Riu Palace. (Yes, you can drift from Riu Tequila and Riu Yucatan at your leisure -- for meals, or pools, or other activities.) There are a variety of pool activities the Riu Palace staff entice the guests to participate in (e.g. water aerobics, water volleyball, bingo, rifle shooting, etc.) The beach was also great - more shade than I expected, as there are A LOT of palm trees throughout the beach. The shoreline is slightly difficult to walk due to the strong waves and the steep incline. The Turn-Offs: The Riu Palace website advertises that no Spring Breakers are allowed. We took the chance to take this trip in March (Spring Breakers month) and found there to be a good number of late high school/early college age students. Most were well behaved, however, the college kids who decided to do their beer bongs in the pool and we found this definitely NOT appropriate behavior for a resort of this caliber. One of the adult guests approached the kids about their inappropriate behavior, and utlimately, I do think the hotel staff became involved to clear up the group and the beer bong party.

BUT I will say - the buffet place, Don Julian had a different theme (style of food) every night and we found this quite good, with a multitude of choices, not to mention excellent service (again those early tips help $10) For those travelling with small children - the kiddie pool wasn't designed all that well - instead of small steps they have a gradual walk-in which is incredibly slippery and dangerous - you need to be careful here. Also - they have a regimented eating time, so you really couldn't eat dinner until 6:30pm - this definitely can affect small children's schedules, but overall it wasn't a big deal. The Beach itself was fantastic, about 150 yards of walking through sand and palm trees, so you had your choice of shade or sun. There were many hammocks, and the volleyball and other activities were very fun. The water was great for boogie boarding, body surfing or just plain relaxing. All in all, I would recommend this hotel for its amazing service, beautifully maintained grounds, fantastic beach and close proximity to shopping and other water/adventure parks. I liked Xcaret about 10 min away by cab.", "Date": "March 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel with Some kinks\u201d", "Author": "JawsBoston", "ReviewID": "UR7013571", "Content": "Stayed the week of 3/5 - 3/12/07.

Prior to this trip, we have stayed at the Iberostar Tucan 4 times which is located two hotels away from the RIU Palace and have had nothing but praise for the Tucan. The Tucan was booked this year, so we wanted to try the RIU Palace, the location is great and we knew the beach was good. The Good: Upon arrival the hotel is absolutely beautiful, the room is large with lots of drawers and closet space. The sunken living room is great, the rooms are very nice and comfortable. The food at the hotel is very good, I would say excellent. We had room service every morning and occasionally lunch in the afternoons that were good, try the club sandwich. A band plays on the stage on the patio at night, which is pretty good some nights and worth sitting down and enjoying a few drinks and/or dancing. The Not So Good: They have two double beds that make the king size bed, they even make them separately and push them together, which just doesn't work, it's two beds made separately and yes, we agree they are hard. Why not have a king-size bed, the Tucan has them? At check-in we were given the wrong room and walked in on another couple that were as surprised as we were, only we were wearing clothes. That's something that could happen I suppose, but it's never happened to us before. Be sure to close the metal safety lock inside your door so this doesn't happen to you. Our first night we walked down to the beach to find tons of chaise lounges at the beach, thought we would have no problem finding a chair. What we didn't know, was that the hotel next door (RIU Yucatan) and across the street (RIU Tequila) also uses the same chairs, so when we arrived at 10:00 a.m. on the beach our first morning the chairs were full. We did manage to get chairs, but it's an extremely crowded section of the beach. At the Palace they never took drink order and delivered drinks at the beach, why? We couldn't imagine why everyone had to make trips to and from the bars, the Tucan takes your order and delivers. As I've read from other reviews, our towels were also in very poor condition with tons of strings hanging from them and we occasionally encountered bugs in the bathroom. For us, we're in our 50s and it just wasn't a relaxing, fun vacation place we had hoped - it was pretty and nice. We didn't like the rules for dinner reservations, as everyone has complained about them, don't bother. As you've probably read, they only let you make them for that day and you have to be there at 8:00 a.m., they give you a number like at a deli and then at 8:30 they begin calling the numbers. The one reservation we got was for Sir Edwards and it was only half full, I thought it was a little stuffy and we left. Don't bother, just go to the buffet, it was always good and lots of variety, why put yourself through it. At the Tucan you can make your reservations for the entire week any time you want, when you arrive, any time for any night. One other thing I have to comment on, as it just amazed me. The men have to wear pants and sleeves at every restaurant for dinner, although the women were in shorts and tank tops at the buffet. The male servers wore a full tux, while the women servers wore short skirts with short sleeve blouse and black vest, they were cool and comfortable. Not sure why the male servers have to wear the full tux, with those jackets they looked very hot and this was February. We had a great time, but in the future we'll have to pass on the Palace.", "Date": "March 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas", "Title": "\u201c7 Days at the Riu Palace Mexico\u201d", "Author": "jwks", "ReviewID": "UR6915623", "Content": "We stayed 7 days at the Riu and had a great time overall but just a few things I wanted to point out to try to help anyone considering a Riu vacation. Hotel and the grounds are excellent. Hotel is very loud due to the tile floors throughout, it might help to bring some earplugs. Beds are hard but just ask for a pad at check in. We did see some mold on our room couch but once again asked for a couch cover and it was put on in a few hours. Mini bar and fridge was always stocked. Towel animals on bed every night! Best drinks are in the lobby bar and order by brand. Cigar shop on lower level has some great cigars and the guy will make you a deal. Shows in Hotel are nothing to brag about. I would make sure you visit the Blue Parrott for the fire show. They do one at 11pm every night ladies drink free down there on Mondays and Thursday nights. Beach is pretty nice I found nothing to gripe about on the beach. (some women do go topless) Make sure to visit all the other Riu's around the area. The Tequila across the street has a Disco although small it can be a lot of fun. Food on the resort was pretty good but I could not give it more than 4 stars and that might be a stretch. I got sick on the last day from something I ate or drank but as they say it's bound to happend. We had a great time and this was our second Riu visit. We stayed at the Palace Las Americas in Cancun the last time and I would have to say they are pretty close in quaility. We went down to shop on 5th Ave. and just be carefull as we did hear some people got robbed in a small off the main area shop. About the hotel, the staff goes out of their way to make you feel good. The door guy always made us feel great by calling us by our names. Room service is quick but kinda plain. The reservation system as you have read is a pain but not a deal breaker. They have 2 types of rooms I would reccomend the garden view and they have 2 types of balconies. Ones you can walk out of and set down and see out of and some that are semi private wall that if you sit down, you see a wall. Make sure you ask what type it is. I got a nice massage on the beach and it was well worth it. Hot tubs are located at the spa (wich is operated by another company) and is not so hot. Pools are clean but I would not reccomend this resort to families with small kids. If it sounds like I disliked the trip, that is not true I just want to make you aware of some things you might encounter. If you don't sweat the small stuff and if you do find something you don't like just call the desk and ask them to take care of it. Also buying a phone card from the front desk for 20$ it will still cost you 3$ per call from you room or from the lobby phone.

However, for a truly five star rating it should address the following items: 1) Linen and towels are consistently stained. There were a number of occasions during our nine day stay when we had to request (and promptly received) replacement towels and linen. 2) The buffet restaurant was good.

This seemed odd to us based on the exceptional level of service. The staff was expedient, courteous and excellent overall. I would also recommend dropping a few extra dollars their way. They certainly deserve it. The reservation only restaraunts were good with the best being Miyagi's (Japanese) we ate their twice. Both the lunch and dinner buffet's were exceptional. I had fried grouper fajita's every day for lunch. The resort was large enough that one could actually get a beach chair at the pool or at least near the beach at any time of day. Our only slight complaint was the hardness of the bed. Who needs sleep anyway? I would recommend the palace for the 30 year old and up couples who are looking for more relaxation and quality than partying. Everyone there had a blast but this is not the spring break atmosphere that some younger singles seem to go after. One last negative which had nothing to do with the palace. We will not travel with Apple any longer. We've gone with Funjet in the past and they blow Apple away. The Apple reps at both the Airport and Resort were unavailable and basically incompetent and unorganized.

We we arrived the staff had also made up the pull out couch for us and although we didn't use it, it was a nice touch. The beds are a bit hard but we didn't feel the need to ask for a mattress pad. Rooms themselves are clean and ours had no \"musty\" smell. FOOD: I thought the food at the resort was great. We ate at the buffett everyday and didn't have one complaint and no one got sick. There is always a different theme everyday (Itallian, Mexican, Mediterranian, Oriental, etc). The service at the buffet was outstanding. Breakfast had everything you could think of eggs, pancakes, french toast, bacon, the list just goes on. For lunch we ate everyday at the El Patio near the beach, they have hot dogs, hamburgers, salads also had no complaints. BEACH: We spent every day at the beach. We were always able to find three chairs side by side. There is some beach erosion to the north of the resort but at the Riu itself the beach is fine. Lots of palm trees, no rocks in the water, beach was clean. We had a great time. SERVICE: I can't even start to tell you how much I appreciate everything they do. Always friendly and willing to help. My sister got sick on the third day, they sent up the doctor right away and made sure we had the proper medication delivered to our room. Our room was always made up fast during the day and turned down at night. Top notch service all the way. AREA: The resort is located in the Playacar area. Very clean, safe and nice to walk around.

It was always spotless. The beds were hard but not enough that I woke up stiff or anything. We tipped housekeeping $5 a day and had towel animals every day and flowers at night. The ONLY bad thing is that we had a second floor room, 1113, facing the \u201cgardens\u201d and the band next door played every night from 11-2! We like to stay out late and party, but when we did go to bed at 1 or so, it felt like there was a band on our balcony! Food/Drink \u2013 The buffet was ok. After three days, I couldn\u2019t handle it anymore so we went to Playa. There was a wide selection but it just seemed to taste all the same. We did eat at Sir Edward one night and found it to be the best dinner at the resort. Room service was also very good and I preferred to eat that for lunch instead of the buffet. I loved the margaritas though, and also had some great mixed drinks. We tipped the bartenders and never were without a drink! We could drink the wine, it just did not taste good to us. We also took our 32 oz. Bubba Kegs for the beach and never had a problem getting them filled. Beach/Pool \u2013 The beach and pool are the best part of this hotel. It was mild and cloudy (72 degrees) while we were there, so we never got in the pool. However, we could always find a lounger at the beach, and found it to be very quiet. We rented a jet ski ($55 a half hour) and loved looking at all the different hotels. Never had a problem with the towel cards, it was a very easy process. Staff/Overall Hotel \u2013 I found the staff to go out of there way to be VERY accommodating. The hotel was always clean and beautiful. This hotel was not meant for kids, there is nothing for them to do. In fact the median age was probably early 40\u2019s. It was a beautiful hotel but now that I have stayed there, I could have just as much fun at the Yucatan next door, as it seemed more like the crowd that we like to be with. Playa \u2013 We went into Playa for the day. Had lunch at Senor Frogs, and dinner at the Big Lobster, both which were very good. The shopping was good and we had fun bartering with the shop people.

In short, the resort is one of the nicest resorts in the Playacar area and a great value for your money. We obsessively read these Tripadvisor reviews in the months/weeks leading up to our vacation and became a little bit concerned by some of the negative reviews. Now, let me preface this by saying that we are both well-traveled and have stayed in some of the nicest hotels in the world (e.g. we know the difference between a good place and a bad one), rest assured that, for the money, this is a very good one. Therefore, I can only conclude that the people who spent their vacation in a tropical paradise perturbed about the brain cell burning complexity of making dinner reservations (extremely user friendly) or the \u201cunder ripened fruit\u201d at the buffet, were just the type of people that complain for sport and would probably have found fault in any resort. Now that that is off my chest, here is my summary of the place: Beach: Lots of sand, palm trees and beautiful crystal clear water. The location gives a nice view of Cozumel which shields the beach from the rough currents typically associated with the area. Because there is plenty of real estate, we never had a problem finding a few beach chairs, though the beaches do get crowded. What else can you ask for? Oh yeah, drinks. There is a beach bar just a short walk from the water and staff walking about with trays of beer and tropical drinks. If you are a Riu guest, you have the option at using the beach at the adjoining resort if you can\u2019t find a space. We never did, but the option gives you a very large beach area to enjoy. Also, there are plenty of palm trees and shaded areas. IMPORTANT NOTE: The hurricanes that came through the area a few years ago caused significant erosion and really ravaged much of the coastline north of the Riu Palace Mexico. In fact, the resort just next door (the dreadful Wyndham Maya) had virtually no beach. Be very careful when choosing your resort if you are looking for nice beaches. We took the short walk to the Riu Palace Riviera Maya and found that the beach area was significantly lacking by comparison to the Riu Palace Mexico, though the resort was nearly identical otherwise. Food: Keep in mind that you are at an all-inclusive resort and a moderately priced one at that. That being said, the food was pretty good. The breakfast and dinner buffets were good with a great variety, though lunch was sub par. We went to two of the specialty restaurants, Sir Edwards (\u201cFrench\u201d) and La Bodega (Brazilian). Sir Edwards was mediocre to bad. I had a beef filet which I\u2019m pretty sure was actually a hockey puck with gravy. In short, I wouldn\u2019t bother. The Brazilian place was very good by any standard. And, as a general rule of self-preservation, I don\u2019t eat Japanese food in Mexico, so I couldn\u2019t tell you about that place. Now, I\u2019ve heard a lot of complaining on this site about the reservation system. Basically, all you need to do is show up downstairs between 8:30AM and 10:00AM and tell the staff members where you would like to eat and at what time. It is very, very simple. You need to make reservations because the restaurants are a little smallish so if you have a strong preference for seating time or venue, get there on the early side. Bottom line, it\u2019s not complex or confusing in any way imaginable. But you can decide for yourself if you think it is. Ask yourself these questions: 1. When ordering meats at the deli counter, do you often get confused, frustrated, angry, or simply forget why you are there? 2. Do you find bright lights or shiny objects irresistibly distracting? 3. Do you speak English, Spanish or any other language for that matter? If you answered NO to questions 1 and 2 and YES to question 3 then congratulations, you should have no problem making reservations for dinner at the Riu Palace Mexico! Staff: Outstanding. When you get there, Manuel, the doorman who seems to work 24 hours a day (I suspected he was a cyborg of some kind), will greet you warmly with a \u201cwelcome home\u201d and probably a high five. This pretty much sums up the whole staff. They are very hard working, friendly, and good-natured. As you walk through the resort or down the halls you will always be greeted with an enthusiastic \u201cHola\u201d from employees. If you are in your room for any period of time, you will undoubtedly receive a call or a friendly knock on the door from staff asking you if you need anything and if your stay is enjoyable. I know it\u2019s all-inclusive, but if you can drop a couple bucks here or there for these people you should consider doing it when possible. They work too hard for the money they make ($200 per month on average). Area: The Riu Palace Mexico is located in a very nice and clean community called Playacar. It has a variety of other hotels, an outdoor shopping area, cabs etc. The area is much nicer and safer looking than a lot of the other surrounding areas. Just a 5-minute cab ride from the resort is 5th Avenue, the commercial center of Playa (a.k.a. tourist trap). Lots of shops and even more shop-employed people standing around out front shouting for you to come into their store. It was sort of disappointing but if you can get off the main street, you might find some local restaurants/bars on the water that are more subdued with a great view of the ocean. Pool: We're not pool people (hung out at the beach mostly) so we didn\u2019t spend any time there. But it looked pretty nice with a swim up bar and plenty of space to lie around. Drinks: There are bars everywhere serving mixed drinks, beer wine etc. The only beer at the resort is Corona. Unless you ask, the drinks will be a little weak but they have no problem adding whatever you want upon request. Drop a buck here or there and they\u2019d probably give you the bottle with a straw. Rooms: We had a junior suite and were very surprised at the size of the room. It was quite big with a sitting area, outside deck, stocked min-bar full of water, soda, beer, and bottles of liquor. It\u2019s true though, the beds are stiff and a king sized bed is actually two fulls side-by-side. Not a big deal unless you want it to be. Clientele: The people at the resort were typically middle-aged and American. If you are looking for a party place or an opportunity to dust off your dormant keg standing skills, look elsewhere. But, if you want a relaxing time with a reserved and polite clientele, this is your place. I guess the demographics were about 50%-60% American. I found the guests to be surprisingly friendly, well mannered, and generally nice people. I hate nothing more than to see tourists hassle or be rude to resort employees that are making $7 per day. I saw none of that. In fact, there was actually a lot of conversation and friendly exchanges between guests and staff. Grounds: A lot nicer than I expected. The resort is meticulously landscaped and impeccably clean with large water fountains and a \u201cpiazza\u201d where bands would play at night and cocktails were served outdoors. Both Riu Palaces have really beautiful and large grounds. Airport: We flew into the Cancun airport. It pretty much the worst airport I\u2019ve been to. It took our bags over an hour to come through the carousel and when departing it took us an hour to get through the massive lines to check our bags. Figured I\u2019d give a heads up, when you leave, get there at least 2 hours before your flight. Bottom Line: Beautiful resort, nice beach, pretty good food, nice location, great staff and an exceptional value. If you are looking for a relaxing vacation and don\u2019t want to break the bank this is a great spot for you. If you want something very exclusive/high-end or a party oriented resort, this isn\u2019t your place.", "Date": "February 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cLove it!!\u201d", "Author": "JoeNewYork", "ReviewID": "UR6817823", "Content": "This was our second time staying at this hotel.

You won't get this at the other Riu's near by. We did visit them and we wern't impressed. Don't go there!!!!! It's the Palace Mexico or nothing!!!

If you're the kind of person who can accept a few flaws in an overall wonderful resort, you will not be disappointed with the Palace. Yes, the beds are a bit hard. Yes, the buffet can get a little old after a few days. Then again, you could eat at the finest restaurant in Mexico for a few days and it would get old. The dinner menus at the buffet are different every day, so there is variety. We ate at 2 of the 'Restaurants,' the steakhouse and the Japanese one. Both were very good. The beach is nice. However, if you like to snorkel off your beach, you'll have to go elsewhere. You can get kayaks and sail boats there, so there are activities for those who don't want to sit on the beach for 8 hours. The pool was also nice. It's not chlorinated! And there's a swim-up bar. Plenty of umbrellas, plenty of waiters to bring you drinks, and plenty of quiet. I spent a lot of time there. Overall, the atmosphere of this place is a excellent. The staff is very nice. Some of them don't speak much english, but it wasn't much of a problem. I tried a little spanish on them and they were amused. Tip the guy who stocks your mini-bar and he'll be right up the next time you call. Note: The guests at this place tend to be on the older side. So if you're looking for hard bodies on the beach, you might want to try another place. It's a little on the expensive side, which is most likely the reason for this.

To sum it up, my boyfriend and I had an absolutely amazing time at the Palace!!! The grounds are spectacular. There is a beautiful fountain in the middle of the complex, and the gardens are always well maintained. The cleaning staff works around the clock to keep things clean, including areas that aren't heavily used. The tiles are starting to get worn out a bit, but that does add to the character of the resort. The pool is smaller than the ones at the surrounding RIUs. The RIU Palace Maya has the biggest and most spectacular pool, made of a larger borderless pool spilling out into a main pool. However, the pool was still nice; it had a swim up bar and always had room for swimming. On entering our room, we found a cute elephant towel animal. The room was bright and cheery, when compared with the one at RIU Tequila. The bed was slightly hard, but had a nice padding on top, and was much softer than the one at the Tequila. The bathroom was large and clean. I did find that the towels brought to the room were sometimes stained. Beside our closet was a mini bar that was well stocked on a daily basis and a liquor cabinet. The beach was fantastic. There is a lot more beach left compared with the other RIU Palace and the Playacar. Also, there was always a lounger available when we got to the beach in the late morning, compared to fighting for one at the Yucatan. There was an area where hammocks were hung, perfect for a lazy breezy afternoon. Near the beach was a bar and restaurant perfect for a convenient drink and snack. The food was very good for an all-inclusive. The french restaurant was quite tasty; the lamb was very juicy and tender. I liked the Brazilian restaurant best, where they served 7 different types of meat cut from a skewer. We also went to the japanese restaurant, but that could have been skipped. The buffet was changed every night for variety and was always presented in a grand fashion. On our last night, they grilled whole lobsters right in front of the guests. I almost liked the buffet better than the a-la-cart restaurants. There was more variety and the food was always good. As for activities, the Palace was never as rowdy as the other RIUs. The crowd at the other RIUs was younger, and more people participated in the activities. But this left for a very tranquil time at the Palace, which I liked anyways. We spent some time with our activities guy, Mickey, in salsa dancing, rifle shooting, and boccia ball. He did a great job. The service was always 5 stars. I felt so well taken care of. By the end of the week, I didn't want to leave. I recommend the RIU Palace Mexico.

The weather was just about perfect. It rained twice for a short period of time during our stay, but no day was a complete washout. We have been to Sandals, Couples, El Dorado and several other all inclusives, and without a doubt, this place had the best kept grounds and service of any place we have been (all-inclusive). The good: The resort was beautiful, and extremely well-maintained. The staff were wonderful as they literally ran to get you a drink when you were running low. Staff at the front desk and the doorman were very friendly and helpful. The live music in the courtyard every night was very relaxing and a pefect way to top off a long day in the sun. The location of the resort was also great. It is very close to shopping in Playa del Carmen, and the Playacar area feels very safe (I felt comfortable going out for a run on my own). The pool area was very quite and relaxing (with the exception of the last couple days when a John Deer sales convention arrived). The food was ok and probably better than most other all-inclusives (my husband who eats meat thought it was very good and was surprised that even the steak was great). The beer was good (corona and negro modelo) and always cold. Neither of us drink the hard stuff, so I can't comment on the mixed drinks. I drink wine and thought it was ok. Usually the wine at all inclusives is terrible. The rooms were very spacious, and kept clean with service twice each day (no bad smells and always had warm water). Room service was very prompt. The not so good: There is little to no insulation between rooms, and if you are a light sleeper you should bring ear plugs. We had a group of five European women on holiday in the room next to us and they woke us up several mornings at 3:00, 4:00, 5:00, etc talking and laughing loudly. Everything is tile so there is little to absorb sounds. Of course, a little consideration for others would go a long way toward alleviating the sound issues. Other reviews have mentioned the beds--we too experienced extremely hard beds. As with any all-inclusive, the food does get a little dull and repetitive after several days. We went into town a couple times for a little variety. Misc.: We spent a couple days over at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya (within 3-4 block walk of Riu Palace Mexico). It is very similar to the Mexico resort, and guests staying at either resort can go between them and use all of the facilities and eat any meal except dinner. The pool at the RM resort is very large and has a beautiful infinity pool to relax in. Because the RM has one large pool, it is much more busy than the pool at the Mexico. If you are looking for peace and quiet, I think the pool at the Mexico is more your style. The beach is much larger at the Mexico, but we found the beach at the RM more relaxing because part of it has been washed out, and consequenty there is not much foot traffic. At the Mexico there are several resorts along that stretch of beach and it was very, very busy. Don't get me wrong, you will never be without a lounge chair or a space to relax at the Mexico, but you will certainly not find a secluded place to lie by the ocean. There were probably fewer than 50 people at the RM beach. No, you cannot walk too far at that beach, but if all you want to do is watch the waves crash on the beach then it is great. Overall, we thought this was an absolutely wonderful vacation. We try not to go back to the same place twice but we may have to make an exception.

I feel I was well satisfied with the food, service, and our room. Grounds: So well kept it was often difficult to get in a siesta with the patio open. There was always someone trimming, sweeping, etc. The fountains were outstandingly well kept and soothing with the doors open in the evening. Room: I loved the size of the room with the sunken seating area. It was actually larger than the more expensive Riu Palace Rivera Maya which was in walking distance. Since I have an extra firm mattress the beds were fine with me. I have slept in heavenly beds in other resorts and actually woke up sore due to the softness. Again, this may not be for everyone as they are very firm unlike the average. I have heard from others on tripadvisor you can order pads which have helped other guests. I felt the room temperature was very comfortable as we had the doors open to our third floor room all evening with a cool tropical breeze and great ceiling fan. The air kept the room cool during the hot afternoons. I only experienced the animal towels everyone spoke of one day, but we did get roses on our bed one morning. I actually witnessed our room service on his hands and knees scrubbing the tile with a brush and bucket. I guess he didn't have time to make a towel swan. The only odor I experienced was the cleaning solutions after the maid service. Pool: Average and very cold. It did feel good in the hot afternoon, but not child friendly or nice for an evening swim. I did witness several screaming youngsters when their parents attempted to take them in for a quick dip. People kept towels on the loungers all afternoon and rarely used them or the pool. This was very inconvienent as we often had to carry loungers or wait until closer to evening. Beach: There was an extensive change in the beach from our arrival to departure. We lost half of it towards the ends with some very massive waves. My husband actually helped the staff drag in palms from the ocean which staff madly worked at replanting. I was very grateful for the palms. There is PLENTY of sun even in the shade. Due to this loss seating did become a problem near our departure. There was also a much larger increase in guests toward week's end. Food: Above average. The selection at the buffet changed each evening so it was not repetative. I did go to Sir Edward one evening, but it was actually more enjoyable at the Buffet with a larger menu. They always had a Mexican section if you did not care for the main entrees. Of course as it was Mexico these items were always great. The chicken tamales were excellanto. I have had much tastier tropical drinks at other resorts, so that was my only disappointment. Activities: This was OK. You better pack dress clothes as jeans appear very rarely and very few women wore slacks at dinner. I did like the relaxing music and the fact the entertainment ended early as we enjoyed the quiet a few evenings. Some of the guests in the outer rooms complained of loud noise from the discos at the surrounding resorts. We did go to the RIU Tequila across the street for dancing and more late night life. This resort was more of a laid back night crowd.

In the end, it was beautiful, but it did come with some stressful situations. First off, I will start by saying that the Riu Palace has a lovely atmosphere -- the grounds are perfectly manicured. The interior of the palace is very grand, with large chandeliers, marble and winding staircases. The staff is very pleasant and accommodating, with the exception of the front desk, who is extremely disorganized. For anyone wanting to hold a wedding at Riu Palace Mexico, a few warnings. I wanted to have a beach wedding until I saw one performed a few days before mine was scheduled. There is very little space cleared out for this: the wedding I watched had beach goers literally surrounding the ceremony, with many wandering or standing in the \"aisle.\" The outdoor massage hut was about 2 feet away from the ceremony, with someone being massaged in it. The Riu Palace staff started stacking chairs during the ceremony, making quite a lot of noise, which their wedding coordinator tried not-so-subtly to get them to stop. With that said, we had our wedding at the gazebo. It was still outdoors, but definitely more private and more organized. Except that a weed whacker began buzzing as our ceremony began and a family member had to go ask the coordinator if they could stop momentarily. An additional problem with the front desk was the purchasing of guest passes. For every person not staying at Riu Palace, I purchased a day pass so they could attend the wedding. The cost was $70 per person. I wrote a list of names out (3 times) for the front desk, who assured me that these guests would not be asked to pay for their passes by accident. Sure enough, they were and my guests paid -- despite telling the front desk that they were part of my wedding and the passes were already paid for. Another quick bit of advice: I sent one box of wedding decor to the Riu Palace that never arrived and still hasn't been returned or found to this day. Never ship anything there. Take it with you or use what they have (which is slim). Overall, I would go back to the Riu Palace for a vacation, but wouldn't advise anyone to hold their wedding there. The food was just fine for us (however several of my guests did have 24-hour stomach bugs during their stay). And I didn't have a problem with hard beds as mentioned in many TripAdvisor reviews.

We used Tripavisor to help us book an AMAZING vacay a year and a half ago at Dreams in Puerto Vallarta. We trust the reviews on this site, it is a very helpful tool. You may spend thousands on your vacay...you should know excatly what you're getting. We are both in our early thirties, no kids. We're from upstate New York...regular married couple just looking to relax in Paradise. We're picky, but FAIR. Enjoy... THE HOTEL: The hotel itself is beautiful. Perfectly manicured and clean. Awesome location---walking distance to downtown...in the middle of it all! The staff was above average. From the folks at the front desk to the people who greet you inside the restaurants to the wait staff around the pool, everyone was very friendly. *Tipping is not necessary, but we brought a bunch of 1 dollar bills and tipped all week when we thought it was warranted. The staff works hard. They deserve a couple of bucks here and there. We were amazed at the people who didn't tip. Rude in our estimation...oh well. Our room was decent...the beds were hard but we like that. The one problem we had with our room was a horrible smell that eminated from the bathroom. It was sour. We had to burn incense daily to rid us of that horrible odor. We laugh about it now, but the \"lighting of the incense\" was like a daily ritual for us! It works...but we shouldn't have to do that on our \"paradise vacation\" DINING: The food was also above average. The buffet was GREAT for breakfast, luch, or dinner...you cannot go wrong. Fresh---good variety. Dinner at night was spotty. All inclusive restaurants are not really that great. The food is generally the same stuff you can get at the buffet, packaged a little differently. There are some exceptions... The restaurant that felt most like a \"real\" restaurant was \"The Bodega\" Brazillian steakhouse. Varied choices of skewered meats! Good stuff! The Japanese rest. was very good. Some \"real\" sushi was offered! Definitely a treat! On the other hand, we ate at El Patio and it was horrible. I understand that it's tough to keep bugs away when you have outside dining, but this was disgusting. Dead mosquitos EVERYWHERE. In the salad buffet, in our drinks, on our entrees. We were grossed out---we left. Stay away from this place for dinner. Unless you want to dine like the people do on Survivor! ;-) THE BEACH: This is our biggest complaint, and for the life of me, my wife and I can't understand why the hotel is laid out like it is. The pool area is great. But if you want to spend a week at a pool, you can go anywhere and save thousands of dollars. There are NO ocean front rooms in the hotel. We knew this going in, but we thought we'd at least be able to see the ocean from our room. No chance. The hotel is set way too far back and it's shaped like a horseshoe, so the only views are of other walls of the hotel or the fountains in the middle of the grounds! WHY???? I want to see the carribean....not fountains However, when we did venture down to the beach to enjoy the crystal blue waters...we found that endless palm trees by the beach made it feel more like a jungle, and less like a sandy piece of paradise. The beachfront was small and very crowded with people seemingly laying on top of one another. If you're looking for peaceful tranquility...you are not gonna get it here. Very disheartening. ...no views of the beach and misuse of their property were our two biggest complaints. IN SUMMATION: You're probably rolling your eyes thinking that we're waaay to picky...how could all of these previous reviews be so \"amazing\" and ours so \"average\". It's just our honest opinion...and we are picky travelers. But for 3 plus grand...you should be!!! Our Playa del Carmen experience was very average. We expected much more. ONE MORE THING: We did a day long excursion to Chichen Itza to view the ruins. Great trip albiet very looong! The best part was the bus ride through these tiny little Myan villages to get to Chichen Itza. We were amazed at how people lived....dirt poor in these little huts. Chickens and pigs room freely. Their 5 person huts the size of your bedroom......amazing. The children were so cute as they walked home from school.

I'll go through what I feel are their strong and weak points, and let the readers decide if they feel this resort is worth their hard-earned money. I paid $371/night (apparently a discount from $464) for a non-courtyard room, and am basing my overall satisfaction on the basis of this price. We stayed for 8 nights in the 2nd week of January. Strengths: (1) Beautiful lobby and grounds. The two Palace resorts are the only Riu resorts with indoor lobbies. The lobby is immaculate and stunning with a beautiful chandeleir, art work, woodwork, etc. The inner courtyard is likewise quite beautiful. (2) Gorgeous beach with ample seating available. The beach is 10X better than that of the substantially more expensive Royal Hideaway Playacar where my in-laws stayed. (3) Strict attention to room and common area cleanliness. (4) Tasty and quite varied buffets, often with rather expensive offerings such as lobster one night a week, carpaccio, and even prosciutto on a couple of mornings. (5) Always good water pressure and hot water for the showers, and large bathtubs (unlike the Royal Hideaway Playacar, though, the water isn't purified/safe to drink). (6) Consistently good service from wait and maid staff. There was absolutely no pressure to tip (service included). If you wanted Havana Club Anejo rum in your Mai-Tai, you only had to ask. Any tips given were discreetly taken. On our last night, we had a simple note with \"Gracias\" written on the envelope where we tipped the maids. The hard liquor selection was decent but limited (only one flavor of vodka, for instance). (7) I actually enjoyed most of the entertainment, especially the Mayan night. Sets/props were minimal to non-existent, and the choreography wasn't terribly innovative, but the dancers were talented and enthusiastic. (8) Based on advice from this site, I asked for and received a room on the Riu Yucatan side of the hotel, which are quiet as long as there aren't any noisy kids in the hallway. (9) I didn't have any difficulty making specialty restaurant reservations. Even if you came in at 8:30, you would get a number near 40, meaning you could pick almost any time or restaurant. The only tough reservation was Sir Edwards for the 6:30 seating. Negatives: (1) Maintenance and front desk staff were problematic. Our first room had a leaky toilet, nonfunctioning bidet, and poorly running A/C with temperature bottoming out at 76F (24.5C). The next day we reported the problem to the front desk, where it was written in a log in front of me, and we received a phone call about it later to confirm. Over 24 hours later, not a single one of these three issues had been addressed. I went to the front desk and the clerk said he'd call me in my room in 5 minutes. 40 minutes later, nothing had been done, and we asked to be moved to a new room. The temperature when we first came in was 74F (23C) which was OK, but when it got up to 75F the next day, we asked that our A/C be fixed. The issue was not even looked at during the rest of our entire stay, and we got a \"Manana\" response each time we asked. Since there were overhead fans, we could use them to sleep, but when I pay $371/night, I expect more than a \"manana\" blow-off response when I have a concern. (2) I went to the gym early during the stay. There isn't a huge number of pieces of equipment, and it got pretty heavy use around sunset (5:15). Again, the A/C was completely non-functional in the gym, although the day I worked out there was a strong breeze which made the workout tolerable. Two of the aerobic pieces of equipment didn't work, which I reported to the staff. I checked the place out several days later, and, to no surprise, neither the A/C nor the equipment had been fixed. (3) We were disappointed by the food at the specialty restaurants, especially Sir Edwards. In addition, the limited times at most of them (6:30 PM or 9 PM) meant you either had to enjoy an early dinner and short day, or miss the evening entertainment if you went to the later seating. I was commenting about this to my favorite bartender, and she said that most of the long-standing guests opted for the buffet most nights. (4) With the exception of Sir Edwards, the choice of alcoholic drinks at the restaurants was either lousy wine or Corona Extra beer (one did get one Caipirinha at the Brazilian Rodizio). This got to be quite tiring. By the end of the week, my partner commented that he didn't think he'd ever want another Corona. (5) There was no seating by the pool for most of the afternoon. Although the hotel has a sign advising guests not to save lounges they weren't using, this wasn't enforced. It would also be difficult to enforce, given the policy of $50 fine if you misplace your beach towel or beach towel card. With that policy, it's not as if they could just take the towels off the beach chairs which people weren't using, like they do at some places. I don't quite understand the hotel's excessive preoccupation over these $2 towels at the rates they charge. A guest would have to steal a suitcaseful per day's stay for them to feel a financial pinch over towel thefts. (6) Perhaps a minor annoyance, but I kept noticing people slipping all over the place (sometimes with resulting broken glass in the hallways). I also found the hallways annoyingly slippery much of the time, even in my flat walking shoes. (7) As others have pointed out, the mattresses are quite cheap. Not only are they hard, but they make these twang-y sounds when you roll around in them. When it comes to mattress firmness, for me it's usually the firmer the better, but these almost left you bruised. In summary, I feel as if this hotel has a lot of good things going for it, including its architecture, its staff (except the front desk and maintenance staff), and its beach. Nevertheless, for the reasons I mentioned above, I don't feel I got my money's worth, and wouldn't return for the price I paid.", "Date": "January 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely LOVED it!!\u201d", "Author": "sheraprincessofpowa", "ReviewID": "UR6636325", "Content": "I consider myself to be somewhat of a seasoned expert of All Inclusives, having been to 6 in the past year. I'm also very familiar with Playa del Carmen and the Playacar RIU's, having visited 3 of them. My sister and I were looking for a 'sista' vacation with a bit more luxury, so we decided to try out the RIU Palace Mexico. I had such a wonderful time, it far exceeded my expections. CHECK-IN: I emailed the resort one week before we arrived, asking for a courtyard view, even though we booked a garden view. When we arrived, I asked again and after spending a matter of minutes at check-in, and were upgraded to a courtyard view. We were in Suite 0135, ground floor overlooking one of the fountains in the courtyard. ROOMS: Room 0135 was a GREAT room in a perfect location! It was only a few rooms from the pool and far enough away from the terrace and main buildings/restaurants that we did not hear the music/shows at night so we got a decent nights' sleep. Plus no stairs to maneuver after a long day in the sun. There was no ocean view, but the view of the fountain was soothing. The air conditioning seemed to be a bit weak, not sure if I'd want to stay in that room during the summer months. The beds were hard, but we called reception and asked for mattress pads and within minutes we had someone re-make our bed with cushy pads. The bathroom has a bathtub with shower, and a separate toilet with bidet. Shower pressure was not that strong - thank god! I had a sunburn and was thankful for the soft water. THE BUILDING/GROUNDS: Although I had seen pictures, I don't think they did it justice. The buildings themselves were very beautiful and the grounds were immaculately maintained. There was a large fountain pool that stretched from the main building down the entire length of the resort, with 3 strategically placed fountains. There always seemed to be one person actively maintaining the grounds. I really liked the layout of the resort...nothing seemed very far away. FOOD: Was more than pleasantly surprised. The buffet was just outstanding - probably the best All Inclusive buffet I've ever experienced. The breakfasts were wonderful, with such a huge selection. Probably the best french toast I've ever tried. Juice bar, bread bar. Lunch was available at two restaurants - the main buffet Don Julian and the beach restaurants that have two separate sides. The food was different at each side, and since I don't eat red meat I was assured that one side would have at least one chicken and fish dish. The salad bars were amazing, the Italian vinagrette salad dressing was like no similarly named dressing I've had in the US or Canada. The Dinner...oh the dinner! I must admit that each night there was something for everyone and each night it was very good. The best of any AI I've ever experienced. The standout of the dinner was the chocolate fountain. Every night there was a chocolate fountain where you could dip the various spread of fruits and marshmellows. It was delicious. Another good part about dinner was the choices of different wines and champagne. We had champagne with dessert...heaven! Never made it to the specialty restaurants so I cannot comment but heard from fellow travelers that they were very good. THE BEACH: When we arrived, Playa Del Carmen had just experienced a period of harsh weather - strong winds and tides that took all the sand away...even some palm trees fell into the ocean and the resort took some proactive measures to keep it from completely disintegrating. A day or two later the weather changed and the beach was back to normal. Enough palm trees to provide sufficient shade and enough beach front to maximize your sun exposure. One of my favorite things about this area is the beach. Absolutely beautiful. THE POOL: Plus: waiter service to deliver drinks. Not so good: the situation of it was a bit odd. It seemed like you really had to maneuver your chair to get proper sun since the generic layout didn't provide the best logistical setup. Plus, there were no palapas at the pool, just umbrellas. It was hard to get sufficient shade at the pool because of the set-up. SERVICE: Now, this is where the RIU palace really SHINED! It was like they couldn't do enough for us. I had stayed at another RIU across the street awhile back and just loved this chicken dish they made. One night I asked the manager if they were planning on having it on their menu and told me to hang on while he brought the Food and Beverage Manager to speak to me. He greeted me with a 'Welcome Home Again' handshake and listened to my story and happily obliged to make the dish especially for me the next night. We arrived the next night and they greeted us enthusiastically and led us to our table - decorated with Hibiscus flowers and sparkles. They poured champagne and gave us a delicious sushi appetizer sampler plate. Then came the main course. It was this amazing Mustard Chicken dish...just delish. We tipped both the head waiter and our waiter and lo and behold, the next night we had another decorated table. Santoyo (the head waiter) and Johan (our waiter) were so professional, so accommodating and so friendly. True 5 star service. Every time I turned around there were staff members bending over backwards to make sure we were not in need of anything, this truly was the best service I've ever experienced. GENERAL: I don't think this is a resort for older children. Saw quite a few babies and some toddlers, all seemed to be having a good time. I would think that older children would be bit bored here, but singles, couples and groups would find this place a great escape. BARS: There was a beach bar within close proximity of the beach, the lobby bar had a piano player there in the evenings and there were computers so you could use the internet. There was one bar - where the evening shows were. It was inside with floor to ceiling windows that opened but still, I found it too hot to sit in. After dinner we would sit in the lobby bar and meet people from all over, it was a great vibe, people were very friendly. All in all, this is by far the best All Inclusive I've ever been to, it will be hard to match!", "Date": "January 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nova Scotia, Canada", "Title": "\u201can objective appraisal of the Palace\u201d", "Author": "FRNS", "ReviewID": "UR6634117", "Content": "I write this as we contemplate our 3rd visit to RIU Palace. That in itself must say something. We stayed there in March 05 as well as March 06 --- my wife and I as well as 3 kids ages 14, 11, and 9. We all loved it. Aside from one excursion during the week, we enjoy staying put at the resort. We were always on up early and stayed by the pool or beach for the entire day. Service was always good. Going back the second time was an advantage -- we knew the resort, including all the little \"ins and outs\". A few specific comments: 1) not musty. This is a seaside resort --- there is bound to be more humidity and saltiness in the air. \"It ain't the same air as Nebraska or Saskatchewan, folks.\" 2) It is indeed \"kid-friendly\" --- my kids loved every moment of the stay. Aside from the obvious sun, sand , and surf, we played tons of Ping Pong, did crafts, para-sailing, scuba lessons in the pool, volleyball, Bingo, and so on. Just because there isn't a guy dressed up as Mickey Mouse does not mean it is not kid-friendly. 3) Meals were fine. Interestingly, their \"theme nights\" were exactly the same from one year to the next. 4) Generally, the evening entertainment was \"weak all week\", but I was too tired in the evening to really care. After dinner, I enjoyed strolling around the resort in the comfortable evening air. 5) Fitness Centre. Small, but I liked it. Opened at 8 am and I believe it closed at 8 pm. \"It is important to me to maintain my well-sculpted physique\". (\"ahem\") 6) Beds --- a matter of personal preference. I liked the firmness of the beds. 7) Beer is good. Bar off lobby area is the best for mixed drinks, but very smokey.(Now that is an area where all-inclusives are not cost efficient to take kids. I bet my 8 year-old only drank 3 beer all week !! (just kidding). He loved the non-alcholic pina coladas. 8) Lots of Americans, a few Europeans, Brits, and Canucks. A good cross-section of ages --- for the most part, everybody polite and respectful. 9) Staff polite and accomodating. However, the evening dining experience can be frustrating. I noted on a couple of occassions that because our party included children (well-behaved, I might add), we were always escorted to a remote location in restaurant. After it occurred once, I did not let it happen again. Be firm when you make your reservations .... as well as use of a $5-spot. I did tip regularly because, since this was our exclusive 1-week family vacation, I wanted nothing left to chance. Over the course of the week, my cumulative tips were probably $40-$50. It was worth it. 10) To the guy from Colorado who won the Ping Pong Championship, \"I'm coming back. Be there.\" 11) Beach is good -- well groomed. No problem finding a spot to sit. Water is lovely and refreshing. 12) criticism: too many people peddling their wares on the beach !! Far worse than the previous year. We bought some jewellry one day, and went parasailing one day. That was all I wanted. I am not exaggerating when I say that, over the course of the week, I said \"NO\" over 100 times. It made it difficult to relax and enjoy. 13) criticism: On both stays (05 and 06), there were 3 days when a large group of American graduating high school students and their parents stayed at resort (from Texas one year and from Kansas the other year). They basically were the most ignorant and disrespectful people at the resort. The students overtook the pool bar, yelling and screaming, pouring beer in the pool (as others tried to swim). The parents (whom I blame) were off by themselves enjoying the beach. Security was called and all were ejected from the pool, and some ejected from the resort entirely. The message: if such a thing happens, complain immediately! The resort will act. I have covered a few points of interest. This is a good resort. Enjoy, and don't sweat the small stuff.

My wife and I were there from Jan 14 to Jan 18. We have been to Cancun about six times and have stayed about 15 different All Inclusive Resorts throughout the Carribean. We would have to say this is one of the best we have stayed at. The staff was always friendly and smiling every time we saw them, not matter if they were serving us or making up our room. The drinks were always just right, not too much liqour or too less. If you wanted more just ask they will put as much as you want. While at the pool the waiter came around fruqently enough that we had a drink all the time. I read some of the other reviews and some people did not like the bed because it was too hard, it was hard, but all you have to do is ask for a pad for your bed and they will bring one and put it on for you, it make all the difference. The beach was not all that great and I asked how come the beach was so small and narrow. The person at the hotel told me that it has to do with the tide, he said in the late summer the beach gets wider because the tide comes in. One thing we loved about the resort was during lunch you could not bring your plate out to the pool, you had to eat at the resturaunt. The food was excellent all the time. There is a wide variety of food, too much to list. The one problem we did not like was the procedure on how they made reservations for the resturants, it was crazy. But if you can not get reservations don't worry the bufret is just as good. We really liked the Mexican night at the buffet it was excellent. Just a reminder, during dinner men have to wear pants even to the buffet, they will ask you to leave or not allow you in, I learned the hard way. We went downtown to Fifth Avenue that is where all the bars are at, they were not that busy we came back to the hotel early that night.

I have read the reviews of late and I cannot believe what I am reading. It was an incredible place to go. My only and I mean only complaint was that the beds were pretty darn hard. The beach was incredible, crowded but that isn't the fault of the hotel, if you want privacy stay at a private island. There was a little bit of confusion with our rooms with our travelling companions but was quickly sorted out. The food was absolutely incredible and although we ate at the Steakhouse and Sir Edwards, we didn't think that they were anything more special then the buffet. Save yourself the time and effort and eat at the buffet, always variety and always good. We met a lot of great people there who have been coming back to this resort year after year. My husbands shirt got ruined from one of the chairs that had been freshly painted and the resort reimbursed us full price to replace the shirt. They offered to try and fix the problem but we were leaving in the morning and time did not permit. The staff was incredible. Just wish that darn beach bar was slightly closer to the main beach area and maybe if they had waiters come around at the beach it would have made it even more enhoyable than it already was. We give this resort an above average rating as we have no other resorts to compare it to. We will be coming back for sure. We loved the locarion, close to all the great things we wanted to do. We walked south down the beach a couple of miles and went snorkelling around some great reefs. My only recommendation is that they make the swim up bar side of the pool adults only.

I personally booked here because I wanted a peaceful vacation without kids. ROOMS- The rooms were wonderful mini bar always stocked with tequilla,rum,brandy, corona botteled water and soft drinks. The beds were hard but we found them comfortable depends on your sleep preference. The couryard room upgrade is very nice. Your views are limited everywhere in this hotel but we were not in them that much so we didn't mind. SERVICE- OUTSTANDING!!!! bartenders willing to make you any drink you desire. Yes they do have premium liquior (for mexico) you do have to ask but they don't care at all. When you sit in the courtyard after dinner it seems your waiter is there before you even sit to see what you would like. They serve drinks at the beach but only every so often. The beach bar is only steps away so it's okay. In the pool area the service again is awesome. Just lay back and relax they will bring the drinks to you. FOOD- Great-good- Depends what you like and expect. The buffet was great more than enough to choose from. Some Special items each night one night (thursday),we had lobster,but otherwise the same things daily. You might get sick of it after five six days but every thing was good. We really enjoyed the chips,salsa and guacamole. Simple but good. Really enjoyed the coffee & cappachino I drink coffee but not that much but the coffee was the best I ever had really!! We ate at the specialty resteraunt once Sir Edward it was good but we actually really enjoyed the buffert so it wasn't a big deal. BEACH- was nice plenty of chairs in the sun and shade no need to get there early. Just north of us the beaches were horrible do to the erosion but we walked to the south and they were all good . (if you were there before the hurricane the beaches are different so we heard ) All in all were would definatly recommend this hotel to a couple who just wants to get away (from the kids, work , daily life). This is an excellent place to relax and be waited on all the time. Please remember to tip when appropriate and be friendly it goes a long way, and these people deserve it they work very hard.

This was our second time in the Playa Del Carmen area, the last time being 1996. Here is an unbiased review of the property. Upon arrival at the resort you are greeted by the doorman Manuel. This is the perfect job for him, since he is super friendly and makes you feel very welcome upon arrival. Rooms: Good sized, although the bathroom is bit small with only one sink. Also, the bathroom is just a bit dated and is due for an upgrade, particularly the tub and shower. We had no problem with the water pressure in shower. There is a toilet and bidet in bathroom. There are 4 types of liquor in the room. Tequila, Vodka, Brandy and Rum. No top shelf but adequate. The Mini fridge is stocked with mixers but not ice. The ice machine in our building did not work, although that was not really an issue since they recommend that you not drink the tap water. Bottled water is also available in the room. WARNING: Do not drink the tap water as it is not purified. I did brush my teeth with it buy rinsed my mouth with Scope after doing so. Our room had a balcony overlooking the fountains in the courtyard. There are no oceanview or oceanfront rooms at this resort. They initially will say it is a $30.00 extra charge per night for a courtyard room view, however, if you keep calling the front desk they will eventually upgrade you at no charge, which they did for us. We ended up on the top floor room with a large balcony overlooking the fountains in the courtyard. Very nice! The Beach: Nice but not extremely wide since there has been some erosion from the waves. Lots of cigarette butts on the sand deposited by chain smoking Euros. Otherwise fine beach, with mostly clear blue water and minimal seaweed. Jetskis operate on the North end of the Riu beach but are four stroke Yamaha models and fairly quiet. Still get some fuel smell from the jetskis though. Yes there are vendors on the beach but they are far from aggressive. Actually quite tame by Mexico standards. Quite a few topless women on the beach, much more than the last time we visited 10 years ago. Not that anyone minds of course! Restaurants: Steakhouse is outdoors at the El Patio Restaurant. Try the Tuna Steak which is excellent and huge. I would forego the portabellos. I got a bit of Montezuma\u2019s revenge from eating them. Sir Edward French Restaurant: Good food with outstanding service. We did not try the Brazilian or the Japanese Restaurant. Lobby bar: Good selection of liquors. Super friendly staff. Never really crowded. A nice place to cool down and relax with a drink. Housekeeping service: Best I have encountered anywhere, period. Really on top of things I think they really appreciated the $2.00 per day tip we left them. Be sure to ask for the mattress pads at check in. They make a world of difference. If you called for a mini bar restock there were there in minutes. Same goes for asking for extra towels. They are always on top of it. Super! Public areas: Very nice and extremely well kept and clean. Top notch! Pool: Small but nice. Swim up bar was nice. Only thing is the depth of the pool which is too shallow in spots. Nightly entertainment: Grease was good. Michael Jackson is a don\u2019t miss show. Excellent! Breakfast buffet: Some tables are reserved in the morning for the breakfast buffet on the outside patio. We were told it was for guests who are staying 4 weeks or longer at the resort. Otherwise no problem with seating for breakfast. I would not want to be at this resort during the high season (December \u2013 March). It is just not large enough to accommodate that many guests. I don\u2019t think it would be much fun since it would be too crowded since the resort is not that large. Also, I would not recommend this resort if you have children. Not much to do for them since it is mostly adults staying at the resort. Hotel was very quiet, no noise problems. A/C worked well 95 percent of the time. Only occasionally did it get a bit warm in the room. Make sure you set the thermostat to low. Asides: Went to the Riu Tequila across the street to watch an NFL football game at the Sports Bar. Not real great with the only food being hot dogs hamburgers and pizza, all pre-prepared and placed in a refrigerator where you could select what you wanted and then heat it in a microwave. Also went to the Riu Palace Riviera Maya. Not real impressed with that property either. Pool was not much bigger than the one at the Riu Palace Mexico and the public areas were definitely not as nice as those in the Riu Palace Mexico. It looks like Riu ran out of money when they built the Riu Palace Riviera Maya. The fountains at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya are just a piece of PVC pipe with a sprinkler head on them and the design of the building itself cannot put a patch on the design of the Riu Palace Mexico. I guess the cost of construction had gone up quite a bit since the Riu Palace Mexico was built (1999) and it shows in the construction of the Riu Palace Riviera Maya, which is only a year or two old. It simply is not as nice aesthetically as the Riu Palace Mexico IMHO. Staff was absolutely fantastic at the Riu Palace Mexico. Best anywhere that I have stayed. Riu really must have did there homework during the hiring process of this staff. Truly exceptional people working at the Riu Palace Mexico. They all seem to love what they are doing. Food was better than expected from reading the previous posts. Actually very good with a wide variety for an all inclusive property. My only complaint would be that the only beer available is Corona, on draft and in bottles in the room mini bar. We did have a glitch with our private transfer returning to the Cancun airport. Gerardo the Apple Tours rep told us to come back on a Friday to make final arrangements for our return transfer with Apple to the Cancun airport for our flight early on Saturday. He basically started talking over me when I asked him to confirm that Friday was the day we should come back to confirm our transfer. So, early Friday we came back to see him and it was his day off. He is too busy trying to sell tours and does not even know what his scheduled day off is! We had to call Apple ourselves to make our own arrangements for the return trip to the Cancun Airport. Gerardo needs to become a more effective listener and stop focusing so much on the tour selling! Town of Playa: 5th Avenue has some decent shops, but mostly lots of junk stores. One crazy thing is that colorful quotes are directed at touristos from the locals as you walk through the town. A sampling of quotes from the locals\u2026 Hey alcoholic, come and look at my junk. Come and look at my stuff, amigo, I promise I will shut up now. Funny stuff indeed! Check out Karen\u2019s in town. Great nachos and beer special. Good place to people watch too.

Many aspects of the hotel were lovely, and some were only adequate. Yes, the mattresses are hard and a king bed is two full-sized beds pushed together (but not made up together). The food at the buffet is fine but the noise and the size of the dining room made it feel like a fancy camp dining hall. (There was a alot of variety and the food was generally decent enough.) The specialty restaurants varied: Sir Edward (the \"gourmet\" restaurant) was pretty and pleasant, La Bodega (the Brazilian restaurant) was tasty, El Patio (Mediterranean and steak house, I think) was fine, and Miyago (the Japanese restaurant) was awful. The thing to keep in mind is that the food at an all-inclusive resort is not going to be as good as at individual fancy restaurants. The process for getting reservations for dinner was a bit chaotic. People start drifting in as early as 7 or 7:30 AM to get a number to determine in what order they'll start taking reservations. The numbers were handed out between 7:30 and 8 AM, but you never know exactly when. They start the actual reservations at 8:30 AM. The seatings are at 6:30 or at 9:00 PM at the specialty restaurants, not in between (except at El Patio for some reason). We always wanted the early dinner since my husband is an early riser. Except for the day we got there when we had missed the reservations process and ate in the buffet, we always got something. (Christmas Eve dinner was buffet only but it was an incredible spread. Also pretty chaotic.) It is a LONG walk from one end of the hotel to the other; one day I walked down to the beach to tell my husband that the rest of us were eating at the main buffet (instead of the smaller buffet that was closer to the beach). It took me 15 minutes roundtrip, including a while to find him on the beach, which was very full. If I forgot something in the room, I really didn't want to bother to go back to get it. Our room was close to the lobby so our walk was the longest. We've only stayed at one other all-inclusive (Intercontinental El Presidente in Cabo which we liked better but our teenage daughters liked this one better).

If you're used to a Ritz Carlton, this is going to feel like a BIG step down. But if you're looking for a nice all-inclusive, it's probably as good as any other.

Specialty restaurants: Brazilian and Steakhouse and Sir Edwards - great food, great service Japanese - terrible, don't waste your time. Sushi is not really sushi (no raw fish), main dishes just ok. Now the process for booking speciality restaurants is ridiculous, people would wake up at 7am to get a number to then get in line to make a reservation. There must be a better way to do this, like i've seen at other resorts, book all restaurants when you arrive. STAFF: Everyone is very friendly and professional. Cleaning staff, wait staff, bartenders, great service from everyone. GENERAL: Gorgeous hotel grounds, everything is so clean, beautifully decorated, great set-up, a pleasure to spend time there. Room was huge, the only negative was a tiny-tiny TV, which wasn't a big deal. Another very strange thing was old fashioned keys instead of keycards, that we had to drag around along with the old fashioned safe key. No big deal though again. Our only major complaint was the noise in the hallways, as early as 7:30am you can hear staff walking around with walkie-talkies, carts being pushed as well as people running around and yelling. We are not early risers and didnt appreciate being up that early every morning. SCUBA/SNORKELING: My husband is certified scubadiver, he had fun, although his experience was ok, it could've been better. The instructors were not as good as encountered at other resorts, also, on Chirstmas morning a dive was scheduled at 8am and when he showed up ready to go, was informed that staff will not be available. Also, another disappointing thing is that there was no snorkeling available at the resort itself, unlike other resorts we stayed at. We didn't do a special snorkeling excurision that was offered, so I can't comment on that. Overall, we had a great experience and highly recommend it to everyone. We would definitely go back in the future.", "Date": "December 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St Charles, MO", "Title": "\u201cWell-worth the trip!\u201d", "Author": "JulieStCharles", "ReviewID": "UR6500906", "Content": "We (4 couples in all) stayed at the Riu Palace Mexico Oct. 25-Nov. 1, 2006 and had a wonderful time! The resort was clean, beautiful, well-maintained. The rooms are large and always clean. The mini-bars in the rooms even had bottled liqour, which we've never had at other resorts. The food at the buffet restaurant was really good, at the sit-down restaurants the food was pretty good. Several of us did get a touch of tummy-trouble, not sure if it was from the resort or our day at Cozumel. The staff was friendly but we really weren't impressed with the evening entertainment. The sports bar over at the Riu Tequila was too kid-oriented so we ended up watching the Cardinals win the World Series in our room. Many of the staff were Cards fans! My husband and I had a wonderful massage on the beach one afternoon, well worth the price! And the beach was great!! We were disappointed in the scuba dive we did at the resort's dive shop. We felt a little rushed, and my husband's regulator was not working as well as it should have. On the boat, our dive master seemed frantic trying to find him a regulator that worked. My husband ended up quitting the dive after 5 minutes, which has never happened before to him. The current had switched so our drift dive was a 'swim as hard as you can' dive that seemed to go on forever. I was glad when my tank started running low so I could join my husband on the boat. As disappointed as we were, the dive shop didn't offer us any sort of compensation. That dive was a waste of money. The only other negative was our room faced the next resort and I guess we were very near their disco. And they liked their music loud and we got to listen to it well-into the night.

It did rain 4 of 7 days but it was usually at night or in the morning. We had plenty of beach time and came back with perfect tans. Resort/Staff- The resort is very pretty and grounds are kept clean and neat. The interior is not a very Mexican feel-more like Bermuda or something but it was still nice. We enjoyed the outdoor terrace at night for drinks and music. 2 nights they had vendors that would sell jewelry (they will bargain). Really didn't watch any shows as they seemed to just make them up as they went along. The staff at all the restraunts-bars-maids and front desk are top notch. We would tip but they don't seem to expect it. Beach/Pool- We chhose this hotel because of the beach and proximity to Playa del Carmen. The beach is wonderful. One of the best I've been to. No problem getting a lounger everyday for a group of 7 people and a 1 year old. There would be plenty of sun and shade areas. The water is warm and there are very few rocks in the water. We found there seemed to be less rocks toward the Yucatan side rather than the Westin side of the beach. The staff would bring premixed drinks-water and beer for anyone on the beach who was thirsty. We really didnt use the pool that much. The hot tub is the same or colder than the pool. The pool has a nice bar area but other than that it was just ok. Food- well considering several of us were sick I would say the food was not that great. I know this can happen anywhere in Mexico but it still put a damper on the trip. We did try all specialty restaurants except the Japanese. They were all just average. The buffet was decent you can go there anytime even though they say seating is at 6:30-that's just when it opens. If you really want to eat a t a certain place (especially at 6:30) i would get in line by 8 am to make your reservation. This was one thing we did not like was the reservation system. Rooms-all junior suites. We upgraded at arrival and paid around $400.00 extra for the week to have a courtyard view. I thought it was worth it. We were also close to my family. Mini bar was stocked everyday and rooms cleaned twice a day. Kids- Not too many. My sister had her one year old with her and it was fine. The staff is very baby friendly. Not too many 7-16 year olds. Not too much for them to do unless all they want to do is go to the beach. Let me know if you have questions- Oh yeah we walked to RIU Palace Riviera Maya. I would not stay there if you want to go to the beach at all. It is completely gone. A tide came in and took away most of the beach between that resort and the Royal Hideaway.

Once we got to the hotel however, we requested our room in a certain area--a large area--we weren't limiting the hotel to a small number of roooms. Samuel, the man behind the desk told us it would be an additioinal $600 to have a room on that side of the hotel. So we declined. Then he said, well maybe on Wednesday you can move there. We ended up in room 0016, a very smelly, moldy and noisy room. It was often not made up until we requested it at 8:00 p.m. Then there was a problem with the beach towels. They only gave us one with the towel card which we used to cover the beach chairs that had bird poop on them. It would have been nice to have a second towel. That evening we did speak to management about this and they said \"is the second towel for you\", like we were going to give it to someone else. Hard to understand this mentality. But we were already upset with the bad room and being hit up for extra money. Then midway in the week they invited us to move to another hotel, the new Riu Hotel. Having lost all trust, we walked over there first to see what kind of a room they were going to stick us in. They refused to show us one. Suspecting that we could end up even worse than we were now, we opted to stay put. The food was good in the French restaurant, horrible in the Japanese restaurant, good in the Brazilian restaurant and decent in the buffets. The help was not very friendly or helpful. There are many problems with this hotel. You would be better off to spend less money at another hotel. It is hard to understand the ratings this place gets. This past summer we went on a trip and stayed in Fairmont Hotels and they truly deserve the fine ratings they get which (I can't believe this) are similar to this fleabag. How can this be! I got the feeling at this hotel that once they had my money they didn't care how comfortable I was. Our December break last year at the Bahia Principe was a much better experience.

The food is very repetitive for both lunch and dinner. We went to three specialty restaurants, Sir Edward (Gourmet), La Bodega (Brazil) and the Steakhouse.

When we originally booked the trip, it was a long weekend designed to fit into two full-time work schedules and two full-time school schedules. What we found as we were sadly packing our bags to go home was that we should have found a way to stay longer. We had a very nice time at this hotel. One reviewer commented on Olympus tours and we completely agree. It was a gorgeous day when we arrived at 11:30AM and we waited for 45 minutes, watching other people get in their vans and leave to enjoy the sun. When the group leader led us to our van and then led us back to the curb, he explained the delay by telling us that the van didn't have enough gas to get us to the Riu. My husband took the high road, saying a slow start to vacation beats the fastest day at work anytime. We were happy with our room, very clean, animals made out of towels, mini-bar re-stocked everyday with our requests, very attentive staff. We didn't have a problem with the mattress, as we have a hard mattress at home. Our view wasn't the greatest, faced another resort, but it was quiet and bug-free, and it never dawned on us to request another room. We stayed to the quieter side of the two pools, when we were at the pool (just the first day). We dove 3 out of the 5 five days we were there with ScubaCaribe. They were wonderful, accomodating to all experience levels, and completely professional, very fun to have as Divemasters. The rest of the time we lounged on the beach, breath-taking!! The vendors seemed to be more prolific in the mornings (maybe because there weren't as many people around in the mornings?) A no, thank-you was enough. We thought the food was very good. We had room service two days because of our dive schedule and ate at the buffet the other days. The buffet was extensive and fresh. I thought the scrambled eggs were great and the fruit was awesome. We never had lunch or an afternoon snack. We ate at the buffet twice for dinner and it was great both times, a wide variety for many different preferences. We ate at the Japanese restaurant one night and the gourmet restaurant the other. We thought both were outstanding.

It was another fabulous experience! The staff was great! Upon arriving in Cancun, I found that dealing with Customs was very easy. They have made some significant improvements over the years. After being processed into Mexico by Customs, we retrieved our luggage, and made our way to the x-ray machines nearby. For some, this was probably the most confusing part of the trip because nobody directed anyone on where to go after retrieving their luggage. I watched as many tried to find an exit, not realizing they needed to get in line and have their luggage x-rayed. Once through Customs, we were confronted by many who wanted to take our luggage for us. I have always taken them up on their offer, and was brought directly to our ground transportation service. I have read that many oppose this, but I don't want to be bothered with my luggage, and feel they are trying to make a living...It's appropriate to TIP him/her a few bucks (I gave our guy $10.00). Unfortunately, we experienced some minor delays with Olympous Tours. We sat in our van for about 1/2 hour without a driver. I watched as many travellers were ushered promptly into their awaiting van and then taken away, so I guess we just had some bad luck here. I really wasn't bothereed by this wait, but one group in the van seemed quite annoyed. It seemed that it was the driver's fault, not Olympous Tours. I watched as he stood around talking, while our luggage sat outside the van. I am not sure I would fault Olympous Tours, so no need to worry. I think we just got a \"lazy\" driver...no big deal to me. When we arrived at the resort, we were greeted as we exited the van, and then watched as our luggage was quickly gathered by one member of the staff. He escorted us to the front desk where we were handed a \"welcome\" drink. Check-in went very smooth. It took about 5-minutes, as Luis explained a few things about the resort to us. When we arrived at our room, I wasn't very pleased with the view. We were overlooking another resort and a pathway leading to the beach from the Riu Tequilla. In our previous trips to the Palace we had a courtyard view, so it was a bit disappointing. The room was very nice, but my expectations were set on a courtyard view. I went back to the front desk and asked (very nicely) if we could be moved, and offered to pay $$$$ for an upgrade. Unfortunately, they did not have any rooms to move us to, but we were told to check back the following day. The following morning we got up, and checked in with the front desk. They advised us that they did have a new room available, and moved us within a few hours. (Of course, I gave a very generous TIP, but only after I was given the NEW room key). This room was very clean. The \"musty\" odor some complain of is very common is high humidity areas. Occasionally, we could smell it, but it didn't bother us. The beach was exceptional! We have travelled to many resorts and found that the beaches in this area are some of the nicest. The water is a turqoise blue, and the beaches have a soft white sand. There were plenty of chairs for everyone, in both the sun and shade. There's a beach bar too. Massage huts were also situated on the beach...for an additional fee of course. While on the beach, we weren't hassled too often by people selling merchandise. The few times that we were approached, we said we weren't interested and they left without any hassle. There was some topless sunbathing on the beach, so if that bothers you....this might not be the resort for you. I also saw it at the pool too, although it was not as frequent. The pool here is nice, but it's a bit small in comparison to some other resorts we have stayed at. There are two sides to the pool. The side with the \"pool bar\" is quite noisy. We spent most of our time at the pool \"opposite\" the pool bar and found it was very relaxing. There are plenty of chairs around the pool, but if you are \"picky\" about where you sit...I would suggest you get to the pool early. They do provide drink service around the pool. The staff providing this service is extremely effecient. I made a point to tip them frequently and found it to be well worth the $$$$. We would finish a drink and they would be right there to ask if we wanted another one. Overall, our meals were very good. There is plenty of variety to go around, so nobody should complain. Breakfast was very good, the lunches were OK, and the buffet dinner was very good. This is the first trip here where we did not try a \"specialty\" restaurant because there was enough variety on the buffet. The specialty restaurants consisted of a Japanese Restuarant, and Steakhouse Resturant, and one other I am not sure of. The service for breakfast and lunch was good, but we had exceptional service for dinner. I would suggest you find a server you like, and then make a point to go to him/her every night. There's no assigned seating, so you need to get there early if you want to pick your server, or find one you like and give him a very generous TIP and then ask him to keep the table for you. It worked for us, as we had our table decorated with flowers and drinks waiting for us. We did not do many activities outside the resort becaue we had done many of the excursions during previous visits. The one excursion we did do was the Jungle Jim's ATV Tour. This was a blast. It's about 40 minutes from the resort. You can either ride together for $65.00 each, or seperate for $89.00 each. I rode with my wife and we had so much fun. We started out driving 4-wheelers down some dirt paths, through some rather large puddles and along some side streets. We stopped and walked around a nature park that had many wildlife animals. We toured and underground cenote that was absolutely spectacular, and then hopped back on the ATV's and taken to a fresh water cenote where we could swim. This excursion is relatively cheap, and is worth every $. If you are contemplating staying at this resort, or the Riu Palace Riviera Maya, I can offer my opinion. We have not stayed at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya, but did tour it during this trip. The beach at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya is very rocky and doesn't compare to this resort's beach. I did like their pool better, but the overall landscaping at the Riviera Maya needs some major improvements. The water fountains have very small spouts, many palm trees were dead, and the shrubs were overgrown. In comparing the two resorts in appearance, the Riu Palace Mexico is much nicer. I can't speak for the service because we have not stayed at the Riviera Maya. Overall, this was another great vacation. We did have a few kids running around the resort unsupervised, and very obnoxious, but no fault of the resort....just their parents. Usually, this tends to be a resort for an older crowd, and is relatively quiet. If your looking for some \"party\" nightlife, find another resort...because you will not get that here. The shows are marginal...but good. The entertainment bands they have playing are good, but they shut it down at 11:00pm. In my opinion...It's a great place to get some rest and relaxation.", "Date": "November 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds ,WestYorks", "Title": "\u201cValue with ellegance\u201d", "Author": "Gordonwhitehead", "ReviewID": "UR6085522", "Content": "I cannot fault this Hotel for food ,value for money,staff and amenities.

I ended up speaking to management on this issue because as a travel agent I wouldn't feel confident sending people to a resort that did not fully provide the services that people would excpect from a 5 1/2 star resort. The front desk was unaware of the problem and apologized, upgraded us and our friends (who hadn't arrived yet) to a courtyard room, and made our a la carte reservations for the rest of the week for us. The next day there were maintenece workers working on the ice machines. I don't think they all got fixed that week, but we just got the bartenders to fill up our buckets. The rest of the week... The Resort: The resort itself was gorgeous, the grounds beautiful and well manicured. We had chosen the Palace Mexico over the Palace Riviera because the reviews of the beach were much better and it was closer to the other RIU's. My only concern was the pool bar which was shallow, but that turned out to be a non issue at all. There was a quiet pool that hardly ever had anyone in it and a hidden jacuzzi that we found on our last night! The spa centre had 2 outside hotubs which were very relaxing. There is a nice courtyard patio where you can have a drink before dinner or the shows. The lobby bar was a little smokey and dark, but a nice break if you had had enough of the sun. Rooms: A room is a room, it was clean spacious, yes the beds were a little hard and were 2 queens pushed together. We didn't spend much time in ours. Beach: The beach was definately the best of all the RIU hotels, there was a beach bar and bartenders would come down to the beach with trays of tropical drinks and bottles of rum and vodka. You could walk for miles in one direction on the beach, but the tides were stonger so I wouldn't advise swimming in a secluded area. We never had any problems at all getting 4 lounge chairs on the beach or around the pool. The hammocks were a nice touch as well for relaxing. Massage huts were on the beach too. Food. No complaints here at all! Breakfast had everything you could possibly imagine eating and all was very frresh. It was also one of the few resorts that I have been to that had my personal favorite - peanut butter! The \"healthy juice\" which was green is way better than it looks, and makes you feel less guilty for indulging in everything else! Lunch - we had lunch at a different RIU everyday, all had similar choices but our favorite was the beach restaurant at the Riviera Palace. If you have to wake up early to make dinner reservations for the a la carte restaurants, believe me it is well worth it. They were all amazing! If you are vegetarian don't go to the Bodega Brazillian restaurant. I am not much of a meateater, but I turned into one at this restaurant. You sample all different kinds of meat and poultry, and they were the most succulent tasty pieces of meat I have ever had! Sir Edwards Gourmet was the best, the food was truly gourmet and the atmosphere really nice and fancy. Miyagi Japanese had fresh and delicious sushi, and the fried ice cream, oh my...mmmmmm! Best fajitas that I have ever had at the Steak house! Other RIU's We felt that we made the best choice at the Palace Mexico based on the location and because we were there for the BEACH, but we loved being able to check out all the other resorts. The Palace Riviera was alot of fun if you like to party at the pool bar - good music, and awesome pools and swim up bar (with tables in the water and sun beds). The Yucatan recently built another pool and now has 2 swim up bars, loungers in the pool and 2 pool-side bars. There are also a couple of monkeys that live on the grounds (it is very lush). The Tequila had the best nightlife, good shows and bar atmosphere. The disco was stuffy, smokey and crowded (everyone from all the RIU's go there). The pool was beautiful and had the biggest swim up bar. Staff: They were fantastic and deserve to be tipped for their hard work. Maid service would clean our rooms during breakfast and also do a nightly turn down service. Our friends arrived later than us and were celebrating their engagement. We arranged for the staff to do something special for them and they decorated their bed with rose petals, a card from us, a bottle of champagne, fruit basket, picture and a bottle of tequila. It was a really nice touch! Last words: In speaking with guest relations at the hotel I found out that what happens a lot of the time is that people come to resorts and never mention their complaints to the front desk. They come home and vent their displeasement on review sites and to their travel agents and leave with a bitter taste in their mouth. The people at these resorts will (in most cases) go above and beyond to make their guests happy, but they cannot fix problems if they are not made aware of them. The only way these resorts can continue to offer and improve their services is by being informed by guests of how to make things better. In my opinion alot of bad reviews on resorts come from people who either go about making their \"displeasure\" known in a rude and argumentative way, or they don't bother to even see if there can be anything done to fix whatever problems there may be. I would probably give this resort a 5* rating if I didn't have so many other Caribbean All-Inclusive resorts to compare to, but I would definately not hesitate to return!", "Date": "November 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Somerset, England", "Title": "\u201cExceeded our expectations!\u201d", "Author": "Lendach", "ReviewID": "UR6043850", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Riu Palace Sept/Oct for 2 weeks and we are already planning to go back next year.

Fantastic. The service is outstanding ... everyone was incredibly friendly, and attentive without being obtrusive. The only other all-inclusive experience we've had was at iberostar bavaro in punta cana, and this was clearly better, at least in terms of service. The building itself is beautiful, as are the grounds, beach, and water. There is a minibar in our room, which was stocked every day, the maids are in at least twice a day, once during breakfast for cleaning and towels, and once during dinner to turn down the bed. The waitstaff were all great, and we found it much easier to get the attention of bartenders here than in punta cana. They also had two guys carrying a tray of drinks along the beach in case you wanted something, both with and without alcohol. Breakfast and lunch were great, but we did find the dinner choices not so appealing...we were expecting a little more in the way of seafood/fish. The a la carte restaurants (we ate at sir edwards \"gourmet\" and Miyagi japanese) were edible, and again, service was good, but the food itself was only ok. We used olympus tours for our transfers, and they were great. They also arranged any excursions for us...we did the \"Mayan Adventure\"...a trip to blue cenote, cave snorkel, and lagoon snorkel. It was fantastic, for the great guide (Jesus) and for the sites. I would recommend bringing your own snorkeling gear, if you have it...they have snorkels w/out valves (hard to clear) and one size masks (leaky/painful). Even so it was awesome, and would definitely recommend it. Our only complaint is that there is evening entertainment in the hotel courtyard from 8pm until 11pm and if you have a room that looks into the courtyard (which we did) it is quite loud.

I read mostly good reviews, but a few not-so-pleasant reviews on this place. Even my AAA representative had been there and LOVED it. But I have to say I could not see anything negative about the place. The sweet people working there were always pleasant and helpful. Sure, it's an all-inclusive, so the food at times can be so-so. But everyone was so nice and it made our family's trip one of the best. My \"family\" was my two college student kids (male and female, ages 19 and 21), my son's friend ( 19 also), my daughter who is 23 and lives in another state now, my husband and myself. The boys had the BEST time of all of us, because they met two cute German girls and their families and two other teens from England and Canada. How much fun is that for two single college boys? With a disco in the complex to dance in, and a town within a cab's ride away (about 5 minutes), and a beach with tons of activies you can't go wrong. We rarely saw them and never worried about them. The spa was great. Henna tattoos were awesome! Playa del Carmen town offered great places to eat and shop at when we wanted something new. Did I mention the beach? Beautiful and full of people from all over the world. (Some even topless, if you are in to that.) Never bothered anyone that wasn't. In conclusion, try it.

My husband and I have been to several all inclusive places from Mexico to the Dominican Republic and been on cruises too. We both had very high standards after staying and being married at the Secrets Excellence Resort in Punta Cana three years ago. (which I have heard that it is being sold and below average now) We upgraded to the Riu Palace Mexico a week before we left on the 30th of Sept. And I am so happy we did. Our trip was booked through Expedia and not one problem occurred. We arrived with the same great hospitality that others have mentioned. We asked for the upgrade that expedia had mentioned and received a beautiful room 2073 that overlooked the main fountain and gazebo area. Our tv didn't work properly and the shampoo/soap dispenser was leaking when we arrived. We walked down to tell the main desk and they both were fixed before we ever got back to our room (15 minutes at the most)! I have to say I am not sure what people are complaining about on the food. Everything was really good considering that you are at an all-inclusive resort. Of course the beds were hard but I have not stayed at an AI resort in Mexico that hasn't been. And the drinks were a bit watered down buth then again we were staying at an all inclusive resort. We were at the Iberostar Quetzal last year two days before the hurricane hit and I have to say the RPM was two steps above the IB. Granted the RPM did not have the \"jungle\" feel or the exotic animals running around but it was very upscale and beautiful. The pool is not as large/nice as I prefer but luckily the RPM was not crowded the week we were there. Now one thing that was quite humerous to the husband and I, is the nightly show of Grease. I am not sure if the performers had ever performed it in front of anyone. It was pretty bad. The other shows were decent. Again, very comparable to other All Inclusives we have been too. We did do an excursion to Cozumel through ScubaCaribe which is the dive shop at RPM. Cozumel was great for snorkeling that I did and also wonderful diving for my husband. Although he did say that he liked the dive shop better at IB Quetzal it was not a bad excursion at all. I had a couple of spa treatments that were great. Including a very romantic ocean harmony massage at sun down with my husband. Right there on the beach where the waves were splashing. Very nice! Anyway...I have to say we will return to the RPM and will most likely try out other RIUs. For those of you reading reviews and aren't sure how to take the negative reviews...remember you are in Mexico at an all inclusive. The beds are going to be hard, the drinks will be watered down and the food will not always be top of the line.

The reason is that some of the complaints seem so petty. This was my 6th trip to the Playa del Carmen area, 8th trip to Mexico and 10th trip to the Caribbean. On previous trips to Playa del Carmen I have stayed at Riu Yucatan, Iberostar, Barcelo, and Bahia Principe x2. Other trips have included visits to San Jose del Cabo, Puerta Vallarta and two trips to Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. I feel at least that I have a solid foundation to provide sound feedback regarding this location. First I will begin by stating that this is probably the finest of all of the locations I have experienced in all of my trips. Upon arrival Manuel greets you promptly with a smile to take your luggage and direct you to the check-in counter. Here you are met by staff members handing you tropical drinks. Although this is done at many resorts it is always nice after a long flight and transfer (approx 1.5 hours) from the airport. Check in was very quick as there seemed to be plenty of staff members available to handle a somewhat heavy flow of travelers. Since most travelers will arrive beyond the time to make dinner reservations, the first nights dinner will most likely be in the buffet. I always have considered most vacation resort buffets acceptable but this was a level above simply acceptable. Considering that these resorts are providing food to as many as several thousands on any given day I don\u2019t have high expectations but this was truly a surprise. Nightly there is a different theme in the buffet (Mexican, Italian, seafood, etc\u2026) which was identified prior to entry along with a schedule for the entire week. As in most resorts there is a wide selection of fruits, cheeses, pastries, vegetables, etc\u2026 There is also a carving station providing guests with the cut of the day. Probably the most notable feature was the wait staff. I don\u2019t think there was a moment where my glass was empty. If you were a wine drinker they would also gladly bring you the bottle so that the chance of your glass running low would be completely eliminated. The one food item that I cannot comment on is the desserts. In 7 days I didn\u2019t try any however I can say that they looked great. Lunches are typically the same however a little lighter selection. Of course guests could get the typical burger and fries but one could also get fresh fish, chicken or a variety of Mexican style foods. Breakfasts in my opinion are pretty tough to mess up. Scramble some eggs and add some bacon and we are in business. I did not venture far beyond that most days. There was choice of fresh pancakes, french toast, homemade donuts, pastries, yogurt, cereal, etc\u2026 The gourmet restaurants were also good. This required an extra step as guests needed to make reservations between 0830-1030 daily for dinner. There were two seatings and from what I could tell two restaurant choices daily. The choices included Japanese, Mexican, Steak, Brazilian and a last that I cannot even remember, maybe seafood. It was called Sir Edwards and was actually the only one I ate in during the stay. Not because it was bad but I actually enjoyed the buffet and the luxury of not being held to a reservation. I can say that I would have gladly eaten at Sir Edwards daily if that had been an option for me. It was great. There were several choices on the menu so of course I am speaking based on having only one of the choices, shrimp and scallops. Enough with the food. There seems to be a common complaint regarding this resort and it had to do with the beds. I will agree with them all. These have got to be the hardest beds on which I have ever slept. The first night truly felt like I was on concrete. Luckily though, since I had read nearly every review on this website I had learned that there was a remedy. A simple phone call to request mattress pads and the situation was resolved. Now it probably won\u2019t be like home but it is an improvement. I will make one recommendation regarding the beds. If you can, travel with your favorite pillow because even though the mattress pads do make an improvement the pillows are still a little less than desirable. Since we are on the rooms let\u2019s just stick with that. I found them to be nicely decorated and perfect size. The king beds are simply two twins pushed together which was actually good because my wife and I didn\u2019t get into the cover \u201ctug of war\u201d all night. If you have the need to catch up on any TV there were plenty of channels which included programming for all languages. There is a balcony which could be facing beautiful ocean, courtyard, or you could have mine which faced the building at Riu Yucatan. No problem for me as I was not spending any vacation on a balcony. I had read some previous reviews indicating the presence of mold or mildew from the flooding caused by the hurricane. If it was present it was not noticed by me. Of course this is a very humid area and everything seems to feel damp. The fridge is nicely stocked and will be restocked on request. I am sure tipping a few bucks gets you more of what you want but probably not necessary. In the wall you will find mounted a built in bar. There are bottles of rum, vodka, brandy and tequila. This of course is available free of charge. Now for the reasons we all come here, the beach and pools. Wow!! The ocean is beautiful especially if you have never traveled to the Caribbean. The water is shades of blue and green and appears to be crystal clear. There are plenty of chairs on the beach so guests don\u2019t have to go out at 6 am to reserve a chair (this was also true with the pool too). There does seem to be little shade available which was no problem for me but I am sure others appreciate the option. There was a bar located on the beach which never had a crowd. Wisely I packed large insulated mugs to lower the number of bar trips which proved a smart choice. It also kept the drinks cold in the hot sun. There is nothing worse than a slushy pina colada that is nothing more than a cup of coconut milk by the time you get back to your seat. There are complementary water activities (kayaks, boogie boards, etc\u2026) There did seem to be a charge for the catamarans and windsurf boards. I am not sure if it was a charge for the equipment or if they made you take a lesson for which they charged. At any rate, be aware. Bottom line the beach was lovely. The pool is very nice. Maybe not the largest of pools as compared to other resorts but since this place is not as massive there was not the need. If someone did want a larger pool, all of the adjacent Riu properties are available to Palace guests however those guests cannot use the Palace property. The swim up bar was of course pleasant. Nothing spectacular but it was nice. The bar service was very friendly however one stood out among the rest. If you have the chance make sure you introduce yourself to Armando and he will take good care of you the entire time. You will also find him in the other bars in the evenings. Super waiter/bartender and even more so if you show him some paper gratitude but not necessary. There were a couple of features at this pool that I liked above others. Probably the best was the drink service that wandered through the chairs taking orders and promptly serving drinks. This truly made it relaxing. There was little need to ever get up. Also nice was the absence of loud music and annoying entertainment crew harassing to participate in every activity. Of course there were requests to play volleyball, ping pong or other sports but it was not an annoyance. Most of the guests seemed to be of the generation that did not want to guzzle booze all day long and listen to overly loud music. I will agree that it can be fun at times but not for seven straight days. If that is what you are looking for then I think you may be disappointed. You can go over to the Yucatan and I bet you will find it there. Some features I want to mention that I think set this place apart from some of the others. There is always a bar or restaurant open someplace. The bars carried not what I would call top shelf but not the typical watered down liquor either. For example, not that it is great whiskey but if you wanted bourbon you could get Jim Beam or Early Times. That is the first time I have ever seen KY bourbon at any resort in Mexico. The lobby bar was extraordinarily nice. In the early evenings there was a piano player to provide light entertainment and a wonderful wait staff to provide drinks. There was also a super concierge staff. I only met one, Tamara, however it seemed that every time I turned around she was asking if our stay was good or if there was anything she could do to make it better. This was top notch in my opinion. She arranged for my wife and I to eat off of the property one night. We had been to this area several times but had never patronized any local businesses and wanted to try something different. She arranged for use to go to Alux (pronounces Aloosh). It was a restaurant built inside a cave. Basically you are sitting around stalactites and stalagmites. It may have been one of the most interesting restaurants I have been. During the evenings in the courtyard area there was typically a band playing a variety of music followed by a show. Constantly I would hear guests comment on the shows and their reviews were less than stellar. In this reviewers opinion they are great. I don\u2019t expect broadway shows. The kids performing are the same kids that are serving drinks, handing our towels and making sure guests are comfortable during the day. Considering this I think they do a wonderful job. Probably the most entertaining is the Michael Jackson show. Following the show the band provides more music. If you want to further your evening the Riu Tequila (adjacent property approx 200 yards away) has a night club opening at 11pm so guests can dance for hours if they desire. I would highly recommend this resort to anyone that wants a relaxing vacation in a beautiful setting. The advise I would give would be to ask for mattress pads upon checking in, bring insulated mugs and also be aware that men MUST where pants to dinner regardless of the restaurant. Some of the other locations have allowed shorts to the buffets but not the Palace. It seemed to catch some travelers off guard. Tipping is not necessary but the staff warrants it.

Where do I start? Firstly the room. It was a comfortable size and very clean and the beds were firm. A few guests had complained that their rooms smelt musty and their clothes felt damp but we did not experience this. If you had complained about this, the hotel had no problem with moving you to another room. Food:- there was a very varied selection for all three meals, the hotel tries to cater for all tastes. I would suggest to try something difference each day, dont stick to what you know, you will be surprised. (The cakes are irrestistable!) As the hotel did not have a full occupancy while we were there, they only opened up two of the four specalised restuarants each night. These you have to book on the morning of the day you wish to eat in them. (The steakhouse was lovely!) The pool and surrounding area was clean and the bar staff do a great job of constantly refilling up your drinks! There is always something going on round by the pool, water aerobics, volleyball, shooting etc so if the sun gets too much there is always something to do. The beach was very nice but you do get the constant stream of beach traders! The evening entertainment started at 9:45 and usually lasted just over an hour. We saw most of the shows and they were very colourful. If it rains be warned, the tiles in the corridors and outside by the courtyard the tiles get very slippery when wet, even if you are wearing flat shoes! One point I would like to make is that although this hotel is advertised as 24 hour all inclusive, if you require any food after 10:30pm you have to go accross the road to the Tequilla Hotel for a microwave hotdog/pizza/burger. They do serve cheese and ham sandwiches in the lobby bar from midnight but these are not to everyones taste! All the staff from cleaners to waiters were very polite and friendly and could not do enough for you.

This was a relaxing no-stress vacation. One of the employees said the resort was only 30% full. We are usually beach people, but the lack of shade on the beach forced us under the pool umbrellas. The poolside drink service was excellent. I think they need to install some palapas on the beach or at least some umbrellas or tarps between the trees until the palm trees fill back in. We visited the Riu Tequila pool and enjoyed its jungle feel (shade!) and wildlife\u2014we saw lots of iguanas there. It was nice being able to go eat at the buffet at any time from 6:30 p.m. on and sit anywhere. I missed being able to order off the menu in the buffet (as we did previously) but the food overall varied nightly and tasted wonderful. We went to Sir Oliver (the gourmet restaurant) one night. They waited for everyone to arrive, took everyone\u2019s order, then served everyone appetizers at the same time, waited for all to finish, served everyone the main course, waited for all to finish, then served everyone dessert. It took about two hours. You need to make sure you have plenty of time if you go to the restaurants. You also need to make reservations early as they limit the number of people and have only two seatings. I missed the piano player in the piano bar\u2014I\u2019m not sure if we just missed when he was playing or if it had been discontinued, but we enjoyed the courtyard music instead. The music in the courtyard varied nightly and was overall very good. There were very few children at the resort but we changed rooms because of a screaming baby next door two nights in a row around midnight. Our new room was near the courtyard right by the stairs, and we clearly heard the music in our room. The music stopped at 11 p.m., so it wasn\u2019t a problem. In our first room, we got turn down service all three nights and even had chocolate kiss on the pillow one night. After we moved, no turn down service\u2014we tipped the same amount, so I guess it was different maids. Second room\u2019s hair dryer didn\u2019t work but a phone call got a quick replacement. I guess they were unable to fix the patio door\u2014it didn\u2019t lock\u2014but being on the third floor, we weren\u2019t too worried about burglars. We were told by a couple of the animation staff that they were going to be off work a month\u2014no pay. They thought they were going to do some renovations while attendance was down. I mentioned it to the check-out clerk and he said the Riu wasn\u2019t closing, so it must just affect the animation staff.

This was our first experience with an all-inlcusive vacation. We booked directly through the hotel which was a great idea because we had free transportation to and from the airport which is about a 45 minute drive. The positives: Relaxation scores a 10 at this resort! It is quiet, sophisticated and intimate. The beach is fabulous and September was a great time to travel because there was never a lack of chairs or towels. The water is beautifully clear. We snorkeled around but not much to see...still fun. There are kayaks and lots of opportunity for water activities without interrupting the peacefulness of the beach. There are plenty of palm trees so it is easy to seek shade if needed. The pool is also great. Even though not as big as the Riviera Maya, much more quiet and relaxing. The area with the swim up bar is wonderful and the other areas of the pool are very empty and great for privacy. I only wished that there were the loungers to lay on in the pool...but still a great place to relax. The grounds are gorgeous and very impressive and the staff is extremely courteous and friendly. The atmosphere at this hotel is drastically different than the other neighboring RIU resorts. The Palace Mexico is quiet, a little older crowd...very few children, sophisticated, and few Americans. It is great to be able to visit a more lively place when you want it and then come home to your quiet resort for relaxing. The hotel bar was nice. Most everyone gathered for drinks before and after dinner. It stays open until 7 am but we stayed until 3 am one morning and we were the only ones there late. The drinks are kind of weak...so we started asking for a double and that did the trick. Most of the action happens across the street at the Tequila. The Tequila is quite lively and although we never visited the disco we did frequent the sports bar. Negatives: I was extremely disappointed in the food. We did find a good meal on occasion, however. El Patio has a good ribeye and the Mexican themed night of the buffet was great. You will always find something to eat at the buffet...but I never left a meal so full that my pants wanted to pop because there was such a plethora of great food. I was expecting the food to be the same calibur of a cruise and was sorely disappointed. The Brazilian restaurant was just simply not good and I ended up eating dinner rolls for dinner. Some of the restaurants were not open every night....probably because low season. The rooms are a little musty and the beds are hard even after asking for a mattress pad. I also do not like the two double beds. When we went on our cruise they at least had king size sheets and could make up your two beds to sleep as one. Now that I'm home...all my clothes smell musty. Overall: We had a fabulous time and would return. You can't beat the relaxation factor. Just don't plan on pigging out while you're there. Take advantage of the Tequila and the Riviera Maya while you're there. Tequila has the night life and the Riviera Maya has a fabulous pool, but the Palace Mexico wins the beach award hands down.", "Date": "September 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "cardiff, wales", "Title": "\u201cGood service overall disapointing\u201d", "Author": "paulcurran", "ReviewID": "UR5883738", "Content": "We booked with Thomas Cook on a last minute deal. I originally wanted to book Secrets Capri having read the reviews on trip advisor but in the end Palace Mexico was so discounted I decided to give it a go. In hindsight a mistake. Holiday didn't start too well. (no fault of Riu). A very long flight was followed by reps who simply didn't listen or know anything outside of their cancun comfort zone. Having managed to convince Thomas Cook's rep that we were staying at the Palace Mexico and not Riu Tequila she informed the coach driver to take us too Riu Palace Las Americas. (totally different resort). when i pointed out that this wasn't our Hotel she rolled her eyes and told me that this was the full name of our resort. I convinced the driver that we were at Palace Mexico but despite spending the first 2 hours telling everyone this we were still dropped at the the wrong place. (Palace Riviera Maya.) Finally after we paid for a cab we reached our destination. If I'm honest after being dropped at the Palace riviera Maya initially, the Mexico was a disapointment. Not only were we met and greeted at the Riv May but the reception looked newer and more elegant whilst we lugged our bags without help into mexico. The guy at reception was friendly enough but we were disapointed with the room. As we walked in the overwhelming sense was of Damp and an overpowering chemical smell - now at leat the smell showed that it had been recently cleaned but it was very unpleasant. The British disease of not making a fuss kicked in. When reception rang a few minutes later my girlfriend informed them the room was satisfactory despite the fact I was finding out that the bathroom light didn't work, the mini bar was leaking with coke everywhere, (how did they not notice) 2 optics were missing and most importantly from my girlfriends point of few the TV had a loose connection meaning I had too spend half the night adjusting the cable trying too get sound. I know we should have complained so it's our fault. Now to the nitty gritty. The service was very good. I was expecting it too be good and it was. It wasn't world class but very good. You got so used to a waiter refilling your glass when it looked in danger of emptying, or taking your used plate as soon as you got up in the buffet, that you noticed on the rare occassions when it wasn't in comparison as quick. I became spoilt you might say. Food I had read literally hundreds of reviews before coming here and against my better judgement managed to convince myself that the food were not be just adequate but good. Please, Please do not kid yourself. The waiters try too add gusto too the proceedings (especially in Sir Edward) but the food is far from Gourmet. My view may be coloured by the fact that my girlfriend got quite bad food poisoning on the 2nd night in Miagis Oriental restaurant and was laid low most of the trip. No honestly it's not great. 2 highlights- breakfast was decent enough and I had a adequate Tuna steak in the Steakhouse. Other than that poor. only 2 'A La carte restaurants' were open for dinner (I assume because of low occupancy) and the main buffet never opened for lunch (not that I cared) The booze was fine. Again staff very obliging and although we were very easy to please I don't think they failed to meet the demands of the the most demanding guest. If Im being picky I would say wine in the room would be nice. Overall I would say if you are going to use an all inclusive then you either want a family based activity resort( which this is not.) or if your without kids surely food and entertainment are key. On these fronts Riu Palace scoes low. It has stuffed up all inclusives as far as my girlfriend is concerned because although I've talked up other places such as Secrets for future holidays she doesn't belive the food will be any better. I can't give total advice having only been to the Palace Mexico but if food is important to you pay extra and don't stay here.", "Date": "September 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bonita Springs, Florida", "Title": "\u201cHad a wonderful holiday\u201d", "Author": "bridgenut", "ReviewID": "UR5815057", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at this resort from 11th - 18th August. We are in our 50s and have stayed at many resorts in the Riviera Maya, Cancun area over the past 4 years; Palladium, Viva Maya, Barcelo Maya, Bahia Principe Coba, Iberostar Maya, Secrets Capri, Gala Playacar, Copacabana, Riu Yucatan, Riu Cancun and now Riu Palace Mexico - so I feel I have plenty of experience on which to base my comments!)) A lovely beach is top priority for us, and this resort certainly has that! Gorgeous white, soft sand and on most days, lovely, blue, CLEAN, warm water (there was some seaweed for a few hours on a couple of the days, but nothing to bother us). I had e-mailed ahead requesting a room with certain criteria (based on other trip-advisors' advice) and received the standard reply....\"we will do our best, but can't promise\". On arrival at check-in, I asked the front-desk clerk to point out our room allocation on the map of the hotel....of course, it was nowhere near where I had requested, but when I politely asked for a change, he did it with no problem = top floor, courtyard, in building nearest the beach. Check-in was very quick (the usual welcome drink) and the clerk was friendly and funny with perfect English. Our room was spacious, clean and nicely furnished - a sleeping area with step down to a sitting area. The bathroom, although adequate, wasn't the largest I've encountered! I agree with other reports; the bath, shower area is very dark and a bit outdated. However, it serves its purpose and I didn't see any mould. Plus, there doesn't seem to be any air-conditioning in the bathroom (unless ours just didn't function very well), so it did tend to become rather hot in there.....The mini-bar was stocked every day; I requested more of one thing than another and that was done most days; if not, a quick phone-call to housekeeping and someone was there within minutes with supplies. Also as per advice on trip-advisor, I asked for mattress pads (yes, the beds are hard!) and they were provided with no problem. I like the fact that there is a corridor with a door to the sleeping area that you can close - keeps out the noise from the hallway outside the room. If you have mobility problems, the only elevators are located at the lobby end of the buildings; otherwise, use the stairs - the exercise certainly came in handy after all the food and drink! It was a pleasant stroll to the beach through lovely landscaped gardens with fountains. Plenty of chairs, but not much shade - yes, there are palm trees, but the foliage hasn't grown THAT much since last year's hurricane. No towel game here, fortunately! However, I took my own beach umbrella (bought it at Shopko, in the camping section, small enough to be hand-luggage, tho I did check it on the way back), as I knew beforehand about the lack of shade and being fair-skinned and red-headed, need to seek shade after a while. We are beach-lovers, so, although the pool area looked very nice, we were never sitting there. The animation team is much more low-key than other resorts, tho' there are activities to take part in most of the day (but no beer-chugging contests around the pool).....more sedate activities! We enjoyed the buffet food and only ate twice at an a la carte - the Brasilian restaurant - it was good, but not great (we lived in Brasil for 13 years), and the Japanese (again, good, but not great). You do have to make reservations in the morning for that night's a la carte.......which might not suit if you aren't an early riser. We always ate lunch at one of the two buffets near the beach, so can't comment on the lunch in the main building restuarant. Breakfast was more than adequate too - something for everyone, from cold cuts to hot dishes and a great selection of breads and pastries. There was a theme to the dinner in the buffet each night; the food was about the best we've encountered at an \"all-inclusive\". We watched the show most nights and enjoyed it. The outdoor courtyard is a nice place to sit and have a drink and listen to the band that plays before and after the show (you can dance there if you want to). However, all entertainment stops at 11pm - I asked the head of entertainment about this and basically it's because the sound can be heard in most courtyard rooms and, for the most part, the clientele isn't the partying kind! There is a disco in the Riu Tequilla across the road that is available to Palace guests too.....there used to be one in the Riu Yucatan next door, but that seems to be closed now and I couldn't find out why. You could find most top-shelf alcohol brands in the lobby bar; the beach bar had some, but limited. This is an elegant hotel, with an old-world European feel in the furnishings and decoration. They do enforce the dress-code in the buffet in the evenings....long pants are a must for men......however, the buffet IS air-conditioned with outside seating being an option. We had a few minor problems which were quickly rectified, including a follow-up phone call by management to make sure all was well. We had a wonderful holiday here and it is one of the few we would return to. In closing, we travelled with Funjet for the first time (most others being with Apple) and have to say they did a great job, especially as we left USA the day after the last airport scare with heightened security. Our check-in in St. Louis and immigration and customs in Cancun was the quickest ever and our return pick-up was not nearly as many hours before the flight as we usually have with Apple.

We tossed and turned over our decision, but booked the Palace Mexico b/c everyone was saying the beach was nicer. In hindsight, I realize that it is better to stay at the hotel with the better pool and walk to the beach...instead of vice versa. We spent 3 days at the Riviera Maya because their pool was BEYOND gorgeous!!!! The thing was insane...you could lounge there all day and not be bored. And the hotel was quite a bit nicer. It's worth the extra money. Email me if you'd like more details or pictures. I have pics of BOTH resorts so you can compare. TRAVELLING WITH AN INFANT: (*I was travelling with a 2-month old) THINGS TO CONSIDER: 1. The Pool: The good thing was there were umbrellas that could provide shade. As for the pool, not only is it small...it is pretty dirty, however during some parts of the day there was a nice amount of shade in the pool where I could take my baby in and play. 2. Beach: The beach IS gorgeous...but useless as there is close to no shade to be found. We would find a small patch of shade (very difficult unless you went first thing in the morning) however the problem is that the sun moves around and so does the shade. Every 15 minutes we were finding that we'd have to shuffle the baby to 'follow' the shade. Bringing a UV shade/tent is a MUST for your infant!! We had brought one, but it ended up not being good enough. A baby 'tent' seemed to work best. 3. The heat: It was sweltering hot! Good thing was I met other mothers who gave some great tips. One is...lightly soak a blanket with water and drape it over your infant...it helps to keep them cool and comfortable. 4. Elevators: The resort is a long U-shape...and the annoying thing is there are only 2 elevators and both are located near the front lobby area. We were lucky that our room (Room 2019) was in the middle of one of the U-sides so we didn't have to walk too far to get to an elevator. We did however find it a hassle as there were a set of stairs right in front of our door that would take us down...but we weren't able to use them b/c of our stroller. 5. Resort-provided Crib: The crib is a good size and they were great about bringing it up promptly...however the rooms provide you with 2 double beds pushed together which ends up being much larger than a king sized bed....so really, your child could easily sleep with you. OVERALL: We had an unfortunate incident where one of the housekeeping staff made an aggresive pass at me in the doorway of my room. My husband was at the beach and I was holding my infant...it was a little scary, but I managed to push him out of my room and bolt the door shut. Again, this is a VERY isolated situation, but I'm sharing it b/c we were impressed with how the hotel staff handled the situation. The manager came promptly and took down the details, contacted the police and fired the staff within the day.

We booked our trip through itravel2000 and flew with Sunquest. Both organizations provided us with excellent service. Upon arrival at the Riu Palace Mexico we were joyfully greeted by Manuel the doorman. (Everytime we crossed paths with Manuel was a joyful experience.) Our luggage was taken into the hotel room for us and the front desk provided us with refreshments as we checked in. When we arrived to our hotel room, we were greeted by a staff member who checked our fridge to make sure it was full of beverages (this became routine throughout the week) and also we received a telephone call from the front desk who reconfirmed our satisfaction with the room. As we encountered staff throughout our stay, we were always greeted joyfully. Staff was helpful, friendly and went out of their way to serve us. Visually, this hotel is extraordinarily appealing. The grounds were cleaned and trimmed on an ongoing daily basis. After experiencing the remnants of tropical storm Chris during our second day of travel, the staff was quick to react to the overwhelming amount of water that accumulated on the grounds. It was evident that the overall appearance of the hotel was important to staff. As for our hotel room, again, this room was beautiful. I would have to agree with other reviews, however, that the beds are not comfortable and if you are experiencing a sun burn the bed sheets tend to feel like sand paper. Another downfall is the noise level throughout the hotel. Considering the fact that the hotel has ceramic tiles throughout, the noise traveled very easily. At times we were awakened at very early hours of the morning either by other visitors or staff walkie-talkies. The maids visited our room on a daily basis, sometimes they would forget certain minor items like rolls of toilet paper, drinking glasses, etc. When we called the front desk they were quick to react and items were replenished without hassle. There was one day that we arrived from our excursions at around 5:00 pm and found that the maid did not visit our room. Being tired at the time we changed the door sign to \u201cdo not disturb\u201d. However she did arrive at around 5:30 pm and still knocked on our door and offered to clean our room. At that time we were more interested in resting and we asked that she only replenish our toiletries and towels. The food and drinks offered by all restaurants and bars were absolutely wonderful. Desserts need some improvement. However this could be a good thing if you don\u2019t want to gain about five to ten pounds on your trip. Just remember that \u201cAmerican\u201d based food such as pizza that is presented at the buffet restaurants is their \u201cMexican\u201d version of it (Which you should expect since you are in Mexico). Making reservations for the specialty restaurants is not difficult; we did not encounter any huge line-ups early in the morning. However you still need to make reservations early because the restaurants have limited space. The specialty restaurants do an excellent job with the food and the service. One evening we ate at Sir Edwards which serves gourmet. My husband noticed a live tiny green worm (about 5 mm in length) on the tomato of his salad (these worms are common and usually associated with broccoli). We notified the waiter; he was greatly apologetic and offered to replace the salad. Afterwards we were greeted by the hotel supervisor, she was informed of this incident and offered to provide us with a special order from the chef, we said that it was okay, then she offered to make us reservations at a restaurant for the next day so that we would not have to wake-up early, considering that we were going on a snorkeling trip early that morning and wouldn\u2019t be able to make reservations we took this opportunity. The beach and the weather were both amazing! The water is a crystal clear aqua green in colour. You need to swim further out to experience the clarity of the water. The water temperature is very warm. The beach is very clean. There were a few issues concerning salespeople on the beach who continuously disturbed visitors. One day after we came back from a swim, we were notified by a nice American man to check our things because there was an older man (supposedly a thief) roaming the beach and he went through people\u2019s belongings including ours. The staff at the swimming equipment kiosk by the beach was not as friendly as expected. We booked some equipment for a specific time and did not end up using the equipment because other visitors had ignored the time lengths and did not return the equipment within suitable time. Staff was very lethargic towards this issue. My husband booked a snorkeling trip there as well. The girl that did the booking wanted American dollars and we only had Pesos. She was incorrectly calculating the exchange rate and refused to recalculate. So he used his VISA hoping that the exchange would be correctly calculated there. Somehow she still managed to charge us $40 more. We did not enjoy the town of Playa del Carmen. Almost all items for sale were ridiculously priced and not very nice anyways. We opted to participate in the night entertainment at the resort. The bands that played in the at night were fanatastic, but they did not play long enough. If you are the type of traveler that likes to stay on a resort and do minor activities this trip is for you. If you like to leave the resort and explore the parts of the country, basically, there is very little out there and it doesn\u2019t seem very safe. We had a very relaxing and worry free trip.

The grounds were immaculate, the hotel staff were always courteous and very eager to help with anything. The water was gorgeous and the sand beach was well groomed and swept of trash every night. Buffet style food was good, and many dishes were above average. My wife especially enjoyed the ceviche they served on two occasions. I liked the fact there was always a decent variety of dishes even though the buffet did have an overall \"theme\" every night like italian, mediterranean, mexican, etc. There was always an excellent selection of fresh fruit and salad \"items\" at all meals. We ate at the Sir Henry specialty gourmet restaurant one of the nights of our stay. While the presentation was improved and the service was there, the food was not tremendously better than at the buffet dinners. Quirky reservation system for the specialty restautrants forces you to eat buffet the night you get there because you were not able to make a reservation from 8:30-10:30 AM at the lounge bar as required by the hotel. Snorkeling off the beach was fair, did get to see some schools of fish near the large \"tubes\" that are present off the beach. Can't really complain about the snorkeling other than the fact that the \"all-inclusive\" gear had a 1 hour time limit. Also, the included non-motorized watersports such as the Catamarans and Windsurfing gear were only free after you had 3 private lessons ($20-$35) a lesson and could prove you could handle the gear. I suppose I see some merit in this so that you don't get hurt, but the hotel (or orbitz) could have been more upfront about it. Be ready to pay between $18 a person (shuttle van) and $45-65 (taxi) for the ride from CUN to the Hotel if you don't book through the hotel. Our trip arrangements did not include ground transportation from CUN to the hotel or the hotel to CUN. For the ride back to CUN we snagged a Taxi out in front of the hotel and agreed with the driver to get a $40 to the airport. Also, if you forget stuff, don't buy it at the hotel gift shop, just take the $3-5 taxi ride to wal-mart and stock up and grab the $3-5 ride back to the hotel. We had forgotten quite a few things and were able to pick them up for substantially less than at the hotel, even once the cab ride was factored in. While we had these minor quirks on our stay, overall we had a great time at the Palace Mexico, and would return to it or the sister RIU properties in Playa without hesitation. The hotel was exactly what we were looking for in a weekend getaway.", "Date": "August 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "hertfordshire", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Riu Mexico\u201d", "Author": "ktduomo", "ReviewID": "UR5712440", "Content": "Had a very relaxing stay here recently.

We decided on the Riu Palace Mexico in Playacar after extensive research. We were there from August 8 through August 15th. To begin with, if I had never been anywhere else, I would have rated this place better, but since there was a basis of comparison, especially nearby in Cancun, I have to downgrade my marks overall. I have to say I was for the most part disappointed. First, I must comment on Apple Vacations. The airline they use, USA3000 is top notch - with decent food, more legroom, movie and a very cheerful flight crew. When we landed in Cancun (40 minutes early), the experience changed. After an easy pass though customs and baggage claim, we found our transfer. It was a bus which we boarded and had to wait for the rest of the Apple vacationers to get on - of course, there was that elusive 2 people who never showed which delayed our journey. Finally we left the airport at 10:30 AM and due to the many stops at other resorts and the traffic, we didn't arrive at the Riu Palace Mexico until after 12 noon! It was supposed to be a 45 minute trip. When we traveled previously through Liberty Travel and also through Palace Resorts transportation, we were always in a van and arrived at our resorts way before lunch! We were greeted at the door and our luggage was placed near the gift shop. We were then escorted to the lobby bar for a drink and \"orientation\". I was surprised when the hotel rep said they had the three rooms ready for our group. But when I noted that two of them were located quite differently from the other, I opted to check it out before accepting it. That was a good thing as we had 2 rooms overlooking a rooftop facing directly at a wall... I politely returned the keys and said we would wait it out until 3pm and asked if he could please get us on the first level as close to the pool as possible. We wandered around and got some food. I was standing in the lobby around 2pm looking for my sons (they took the odd room) when the hotel rep called to me and said that he had our rooms ready. It couldn't have worked out better as we had 0018 and 0020 which, as you walk out of the main building at ground level, are directly to the right. We had easy access to everything from there and although a little noisy in the morning, closing the middle door in the room cut the noise off completely. We also had a statue in a garden directly outside of our patio for a nice view. As previously posted by others, a courtyard view is $30 extra per person per night - totally not worth it! Quite a change from our usual hotels in Cancun where 60% of the rooms are ocean view with no upcharge! There is a small downside sitting on the patio in the late afternoon, as you are listening to the people and carts using the the beach access walkway for the Riu.Tequila. The accommodations were very good and it was a plus to have the sitting area. I enjoyed the high-backed lumpy couch with sinking cushions which were my savior for the week. The beds are worse than sleeping on rocks (for me) and even getting a pad on the bed didn't help (like putting a tissue over the rocks) so after two nights of really painful sleep I hit on the idea of using the couch cushions on the bed. The first two nights I shared with the wife but when she started to toss her cushion to the floor mid-way through the night I took them both over completely. The TV was quite small, but it did receive a lot of channels (American included). The mini-bar was well stocked and the liquor dispensers were a nice touch. A coffee maker would be a plus, as the only place to get coffee is in the bar or in the courtyard (only at breakfast). Ice was a bit of a problem. The ice machine on our ground floor broke mid-week and 2 days later, the spot it occupied was walled over and repainted. The ice machine was taken away and never appeared again! The beach at the Riu Palace Mexico is superb! There are not the rolling waves of Cancun, so it is calmer and very beautiful. There are a few clusters of rocks, but not too much of a problem. The best time to go is in the morning - clear water. Afternoon, the water gets more cloudy & full of seaweed. No problem, though, we just switched to the pool. The pools are separated - one very nice and deeper with no swim up bar - the other is ridiculously shallow! It is only about 3' deep ....a little ridiculous when one goes to stand up and walk away from the bar (especially me at 6'6\").Whoever designed the pool area in two sections and decided not to connect them obviously never walked on those hot paving stones. We NEVER went anywhere around the hotel or pool area without sandals on and there was always a line-up of them along the edges of the pool. It would be a great idea to take some of the vast expanse of jungle and sand and put in a larger deeper pool. Now for the food. It was just not up to par. The buffet was expansive, but mostly the same thing every day & night. If you want it to be fresh better get there early because the heat does wilt the food. They did have specialty nights, where they would add a few dishes, but if you has a seafood buffet the night before, you would see the same seafood the next day for lunch! I heard about a chocolate fountain but never saw one! While I didn't have any problems booking the specialty restaurants, even at 8:30 to 9am each day, I couldn't say there was much reason to make that effort. We did love the Japanese restaurant and tried to book it again for our last night, but we were informed it was closed due to low hotel occupancy. After the terrorist plot was foiled, there was a noticeable decline in people at this hotel with very few checking in. We were told there were around 600 people on Monday, the day before we left. The other specialty restaurants really aren't so special. The menus are very limited and they offer none of the presentations we have been accustomed to at other Cancun hotel specialty restaurants (pretty plate designs using the food & sauces). The Italian restaurant was never open at night and the steakhouse was so hot that the waiters were dripping with sweat! Also, except for the Japanese, they were all partial buffet as you had to get your own salad (except Sir Edward) and dessert (all). It was really ridiculous for the dress code to be enforced in the buffet restaurant. Men were required to wear long pants with a collared shirt. Women could wear anything. How dressy are torn jeans compared to a nice pair of walking shorts. More food notes which I wish I had known beforehand: except for the buffets served, there are no snacks to speak of. The Cubano bar serves nothing, but if you are sitting at the bar, the bartender has small plates of peanuts behind the bar - if you know to ask for them. The pool bar does have the nacho machine and the empty popcorn machine. It's difficult to drink alcohol without something to munch on. Other hotels we have been to have brought out snacks in the afternoon at about 4PM.; they also did specialty things like making mexican coffee or crepes- but not the \"upscale Riu\". I honestly think I only paid for their architecture and expansive property! No complaints about the alcohol - it was top shelf and always flowing. I note in other reports complaints about management but I have to say the staff that I encountered were excellent. They seemed to be not used to tipping, as when I did it, it took about two days for word to get around - I found my treatment to be very different on day three, as they all knew by then to look for me. My wife enjoyed her chair held, our napkins were always placed on our laps, etc.... My other encounter with the front desk involved a broken suitcase handle (manufacturer's defect - it was brand new). I asked where I could get a nut and a screw to temporarily fix it - the front desk person told me they would send maintenance when I went back to my room. A young handyman took the case away and brought it back repaired and better than new !! I was really pleased with that. Also as reported before, the doorman Manuel was amazing! He stood out in his uniform and always was friendly and helpful. Most of the staff were great and very hard working. We only received 2 towel animals in the room (we are accustomed to one each day - spoiled I know) although we tipped $5 per day. The night time entertainment was held outside in the courtyard. Although it was not as hot as when the sun was out, it was a little uncomfortable. They have a strange system of bringing you drinks. There is a main waiter who takes your order and another one brings it. There were several times we had to reorder when our order didn't show up. The band in the center of the courtyard was very good. They also had a kiddie show which involved the younger guests each night - this did not change - cute at first, monotonous later. The main entertainment rotated around the other hotels. The Michael Jackson show was surprisingly good. The Mayan show was amazing - do not miss it! Very professional. We took one trip to Xel Ha which was very nice. If you go to south to Tulum or anywhere through there, you need to check if they are done with the road changes in the Puerto Aventura area. It seems a pedestrian was run down on the road the previous week and the locals were very upset. They came in and shut the highway down to one lane and were installing huge speed bumps in the highway. This created an hour backup both ways to get through this town. I really felt bad for those staying at the Aventura Palace as this all occurred right at their front entrance. We also went into to the town of Playa del Carmen ($5 cab ride - well worth it) and enjoyed that immensely we did regret that we didn't get to try out any restaurants there as they all looked very inviting. We walked to all the other Riu's in the area and were satisfied with our choice (the Riu Palace Riviera Maya was the only other one with an air-conditioned lobby) although the other hotels had better pools. We did have the best beach area. When it was time for our departure, we discovered that there was no bell service before 7AM! There was also no room service for a quick breakfast before 7AM either! Our pick-up was scheduled for 7:10 AM, so we were almost out of luck. Fortunately, there was some coffee set up outside in the courtyard.with a basket of about 6 pastries. They call this \"continental breakfast\" and set it up at 6:30 AM. So all in all when I do go back to Mexico, it won't be to another Riu. The Palaces are way too quiet and stuffy and the others just don't measure up to what I am used to.", "Date": "August 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Erie, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cBetter than average\u201d", "Author": "actran", "ReviewID": "UR5703098", "Content": "We went to the Riu Palace Mexico with our kids (14, 17 and 20 yo and his SO) for a 1 week vacation. For reference - my husband and I have stayed at the Royal Hideaway 3 times which has set the bar ridiculously high, and we took the kids to the Grand Xcaret last year. It was definitely a better resort than OGFX. We always use Cancun Valet for transportation and they came through again with flying colors. We arrived at the RPM and the driver unloaded our bags and we took them into the lobby. I said to my daughter that at RH you don't touch your bags and they meet you at your vehicle. Comparing wasn't going to help me enjoy the RPM, and it is a resort that deserved to be enjoyed on its own merits. We were checked in quickly, given welcome drinks (tropical jiuce blend), wristbands (they asked who was under 18 and when I said my daughter was almost 18 they wouldn't give her and adult band. That was fine with me and I wasn't going to say she was 18 when she's not, but I know this is an inconsistent rule and she met a girl who was 17 who was given an adult band). We were taken to our rooms. I had asked that the 3 rooms be in close proximity, and they were right next to each other. I had also asked for a top floor and courtyard view and we didn't get either. Our patio faced the neighboring resort, but it wasn't a bad view because there is a big strip of grass and a gazebo and other decorations. Our room was really hot and humid because the patio door had not been locked and the air conditioning goes off if it's not locked. It eventually cooled down. The room and housekeeping was fine. We tipped just about every day. We got towel animals for about 1/2 our stay. One maid was rather agressive in her cleaning and threw out a piece of paper in our kids room that had an important number written on it. They provided turn down service and new large towels in the evening. A couple problems (and what made the most significant negative impression on me) was 1)our room had no deadbolt and when I went to the front desk they told me it woud be fixed that day or the next. It was never fixed and once they called to see how things were and my husband mentioned it and was told it was because they were switching to a key card system. That didn't make a whole lot of sense because our other 2 rooms had deadbolts. They use keys that have your room number on them and when my husband went to the front desk to ask for another key they just gave him one without asking for any kind of id. Another problem was when I called the front desk and asked for a blanket. I had been cold the first night and when I was in another one of our rooms saw a blanket on one of the beds. They had 2 in their closet, but we had none. The guy who answered the phone said they would send one up. No blanket ever came even after 4 phone calls and a trip to the front desk. I was told it was on it's way, they were looking for one, it should be there soon. I finally got one from one of our other rooms. The next morning the same guy was at the front desk and I told him it had never arrived and if they had just told me that I wouldn't have kept waiting. He apologized and said he would send \"something\" to my room. That \"something\" must have stayed with the blanket that never came. The property is very beautiful and I really enjoyed the walk to the beach. There are fountains along the whole path and it is very nicely landscaped. The beach is HUGE and there are plenty of places to find shade - which was a big concern before we went. The food was average to good. The Brazilian restaurant was very good. The Steakhouse was not very good, but is outdoors near the beach and had a nice atmosphere. The Asian was pretty average. My daughter was really looking forward to the deep fried ice cream, but it was terrible with all the ice cream melted and the coating soggy. We ate at the gourmet twice. I really liked the duck, but the filet was average and my husband didn't like either of the seafood dishes he ordered. The buffets had good buffet food. But contrary to what others had written I didn't find it that great. It was still buffet food. There are 2 restaurants open for lunch but you can sit at one and go over to the other's buffet if you want. We didn't find the reservation system that much of a problem as we were usually up early enough to get in line early and get the reservations we wanted. My son tried to get reservations the first morning we were there towards the end of the time they take them and everything was full. When we checked in and they told us about the ala carte restaurants I asked if any were closed on certain nights and he said everything was open every night. In reality there was one that was closed every night. The staff at the restaurants were great. The gourmet restaurant had a really nice Cabernet, but I couldn't seem to get it anywhere else. The lunch restaurants only had beer, wine soda and water. No mixed drinks at lunch. The main breakfast buffet had a mimosa station, as well as a station with freshly made juices of many varieties. There was a restaurant down by the beach that served a continental breakfast from 10:30-12:00 for those sleeping in. I had heard you could get a continental breakfast via room service, but it wasn't advertised at all so I don't know if they still do that. The entertainment was pretty typical AI entertainment. They had a band playing in the plaza at night that we enjoyed listening to while we had drinks after dinner. A couple nights vendors were set up in the plaza. The animacion team was fine. They didn't seem to have a whole lot of people participating in their activities. I did take a Spanish lesson one day. He taught us a lot of numbers and a few phrases. Not too helpful. I asked when he was going to teach us how to say \"Give me the good tequila.\" He never did teach me that. The staff seemed to appreciate efforts at speaking Spanish. At the Steakhouse they asked if we spoke Spanish and I said a little but my daughter speaks a lot. They proceeded to give her all the information in Spanish and then she told us what they said. We didn't spend much time at the pool, but there were plenty of chairs available throughout the day. There is a beach bar and a pool bar. The waiters would bring around trays of different drinks with bottles of rum and vodka to add if you wanted. Some days they seemed to come around every hour and some days it was like once I saw them. This may have been a function of how busy the pool was because they came around very frequently at the pool. We saw quite a few families with kids, although it certainly wasn't overrun with kids. I saw one single guy and lots of couples. There is a lot of topless and a lot of smoking. There are a lot of Europeans and they seemed to constitute a lot of the smokers. I hate smoke and wish there was an effort to seperate the smokers from those of us who like to breath clean air. One other issue I had was with the tap water in the room. No one ever said anything about it, but the hotel services guide in the room said the tap water was not drinkable and there was a little sticker that was not obvious at all next to the mirror. I brushed my teeth a couple times with tap water but after I saw that I used bottled water. My husband continued to use tap water. I got sick and he didn't. Another thing that makes the RPM a great place is the stretch of beach it is on and it's proximity to PDC - a $5 cab ride. The Riu Palace Mexico is a nice resort and a good value for what they charge. I don't know if I would return though. (I do know I'll return to the Royal Hideaway).", "Date": "August 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Monterrey, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cSplendid Palace Vacations\u201d", "Author": "SteveEdmunds", "ReviewID": "UR5618040", "Content": "Just returned from the Riu Palace Mexico 10 to 15 August and has a superb time with my wife and 13 yr old son. I am British and the wife is Mexican. We live in the north of Mexico. Pretty much most of the reviews in here are quite accurate but I would like to add my own findings and hope you find the comments as useful as I did when reading the other reviews. This Palace \"Mexico\" (there'a another four hotels along called the \"Riviera Maya\") is quite an experience. Its architecture is stunning, and really takes you back to a grand old Mexican 'Hacienda' type building, superbly laid out and abundant in gardens, lawns, fountains and beach, and palacial internal decor that makes you feel you are in the setting that it pretends to take you to. Al in all, a great place to take a relaxing holiday and staff that works happily with service in mind. These peole are very good at what they do and try their very best to please. Congratulations for all the teamwork and smiling faces. I admire you all. 10 out 10 across the board for this hotel but there are some little issues you need to take into acount ... here they are one by one: POOL: Very small and very warm. My thoughts here are that RIU should take advantage of the abundant space on the lawn found on the beach side of the pool area and either expand the current pool or build a new one ... and make it a little deeper! 3'0\" just about all over and 4'0\" here and there means that even the floor of the pool heats up with the sun's piercing summer rays and the water thus remains pretty warm. Also, it all seems so cramped around the pool bar as it is the largest area to 'hang out' in whether you are an adult or a child.If you are a pool lover, you will be disappointed with this one. RESTAURANTS: The speciality ones do require advanced booking for evening meals. I never bothered to book once as I didn't fancy queuing up for 40 mins at 8am every morning to make a reservation. We ate at the Don Julian Buffet every night, and it is delicious. I peeked into the specialty restaurants a couple of times and they seemed very quiet and deserted anyway and I cannot therefore comment o the food and service in those. Perhaps I wasn't the only one wishing to avoid holiday queues! The variety in the buffet was quite amazing and I wondered just how they keep so many dishes 'on the move'. A good logistics chef no doubt and certainly JIT!!!! Just one little complaint, the egg chef! Makes sure you clearly explain how you want your eggs as the guy there is clueless and takes offence if you don't like 'em 'his way'! ROOMS: Nice, but careful if you are looking for a) a sea view: only about a two dozen rooms offer this (and the sea is about 100 or so yards from these rooms) or b) a view of the fountains, because most folk are placed in c) rooms with a view of the hotels on each side of the Palace, and not too nice at that! I asked for a room with a view to the fountains and had to pay 30USD extra per person per room per night to get it! The lay out of the room was identical. so you pay for the view! DRINKS: I love a beer, much more so than top shelf liquor, and found it strange that while you could get a triple shot of Chivas Regal, Gordon's, Jim Beam, Napoleon, etc in ALL the bars it was only draught corona for the beer drinkers. Yukky stuff at that. Good old Don Julian at least served bottled Corona while dining, but apart from that and the two bottles per day in the room mini bar, that was it! Even the Patio bar with throngs of folk sitting enjoying themselves at night had to drink warmish Corona from the barrel. Come on Riu. A few tubs of bottled beer on ice is not too difficult to set up or that much more expensive than barrelled beer, if that is an issue. Also, the wife is partial to a 'light' beer. None to be found at this hotel, period. ENTERTAINMENT AT NIGHT The nucleus of this is the Patio Bar from sunset to 11pm. It goes like this ... Sunset: a band starts playing for about 20 to 30 mins. 30 Mins Later: the band stops for the kids mini disco held in the theatre adjoining the Patio. Mini Disco: No variation whatsoever night to night with same set each day for about 40 mins. (The songs and patter get a bit tedious after hearing them for several nights on the trot as the theatre used for this flows out onto the Patio where folk sit to enjoy a pre or post meal drink.) 40 Mins later: Mini Disco stops; band resumes for 2 more songs 2 songs later: Band stops for Nighly show in Theatre. Some of these were quite entertaining; some were cheesy (see other reviews) This lasts best part of an hour. 10:40pm or thereabouts: The band resumes again, plays about 3 or 4 songs, and then on the stroke of 11pm bid you farewell, and good night, like \"Time for bed, folks!\" And just as we were getting in the swing of things after dinner and a couple of warm Coronas! For me, I think that the theatre and its own bar is poorly used ... why the band couldn't play for another, say, one hour in there beats me or a roaming Mexican Trio band to provide a romantic and nice, cultural touch for the Mums and Dads enjoying the fresher evening air. I understand the need to 'quieten down' outside at 11 ish for folk that do want to go to sleep around then, but those who want to listen to music a little longer are left twiddling their thumbs. OK, so entertainment is available next door and at the other Riu's but ... I don't want to go the other ones! I want to stay in the Palace and relax, not move around looking for the entertainment. BEACH: The best on the Riviera Maya. Simply fantastic and certainly helps to take away the disappointment of the pool. If you are a beach lover, you will be in awe. As I said earlier, 10 out of 10, and that score remains, even after pointing out the little issues above. Would I go back. I most certianly would, but perhaps I'd give the newer Palace Riviera Maya a try first. I may well be wrong though as this hotel has so many good points. I just hope they brush up on some of the issues above.

First of all, everyone said it was a \u00bd hr ride but it was more like an hour and a half by the time you stopped at other hotels to drop off other people. We got in quite early, nonetheless, and checked in at about 10am. We were told our room wouldn\u2019t be ready until 3pm and our stuff was just carted to the side of the lobby near the store which made me uncomfortable because people were over there pulling out stuff from their suitcases and nobody knew who\u2019s was who\u2019s, but there wasn\u2019t anything I could do about it. Anyway, after a long trip I really wanted to change and get in the pool or something, not just loiter around the building. We went down to eat and walked around and I checked back at the desk at about 2:30 and got a room. The view I think may have been the worst in the hotel. It was on the side away from the pool with the slider going out to a patio, a patch of grass, and then a gate separating the resort from the one next door. That wouldn\u2019t have been horrible but there was a building there that it looked like they might have been keeping supplies or something in that people were always out there getting into day and night. I had to keep the shades drawn the whole time since everyone could see in. The beds are very hard, I asked for mattress pads about 3-4 times but never saw any. I only got towel animals when we left at least $5 on the bed. But they did keep the rooms very clean and the shower had the best water pressure I ever felt. I was on the 1st floor and didn\u2019t smell any mold or anything and the air in the bedroom worked great. The food was mediocre at best in the buffet. I think they definitely go for more quantity than quality. The restaurants though are wonderful. We ate at the Brazilian restaurant which was great besides one thing nobody mentioned. When you are making your reservations in the morning and they have the menus sitting out to look at the Brazilian restaurant menu is not a choice! You get ALL SIX Meats. They bring them out on skewers one at a time and you eat them all. I didn\u2019t care for the appetizers or dessert. I will admit I can be a picky eater but my husband will eat anything and we felt the same way about all the food I am mentioning. We also ate at Sir Edwards which is the Gourmet French restaurant, I had the steak, and my husband had the duck. The restaurant was very good, even the dessert. But then we went back the next night and although the food was still good the air conditioning didn\u2019t work and it was unbearably hot. All the other night we ate at the buffet and I am sorry if you though it was great but I though it was pretty awful. Lunch at El Patio and the La Traviata was better than the buffet; I could at least get pasta or a hot dog. Don\u2019t expect the ice cream to taste like regular ice cream though. Unfortunately there wasn\u2019t really a choice for breakfast so I had to settle for toast or generic cereal. Night life was practically nonexistent. We went across the street to the Club Hotel Riu Tequila and it was much livelier over there in the lounge bar. We stayed one night to check out the \u201cLa Pinata\u201d Disco but it reeked of alcohol, the smoke was horrible, and it was more like an underage drunk fest than anything else. I saw them kick some kids out for not being old enough but they didn\u2019t check everyone. Shopping was ok, even if you are bringing a camera I would recommend bringing a disposable one because mine broke while there and I had to buy one and it was like $15 for an outdoor only 24exp disposable with no flash. I haven\u2019t yet seen how those pictures will come out. Shopping is nice over at la plaza. I wouldn\u2019t recommend walking to 5th Ave, it\u2019s worth the ride for $5 and trust me, 5th Ave is so long you don\u2019t want to walk any further than necessary. We went to McDonalds to see what it was like and it was great and clean and they had a tv in it and an upstairs, it was awesome. The only complaint I had was the ketchup which I love, it was not the same. Back to shopping.. Make sure you barter! My husband bought a hat, it started out at $60 and we finally got it for $30. If you find you need supplies like anything normal, take a cab to Chedraui \u2013 it\u2019s like a grocery store/target all in one, and meant for the locals it is a lot cheaper. Besides it is just fun to look. We took a couple of the trips, we did the \u00bd day snorkeling adventure thing. It was ok besides the fact that it was longer than advertised, some people missed their dinner reservations. I don\u2019t know about you but I want to go, snorkel, and come back. They want you to go.. talk.. lay in a hammock.. snorkel for two hours.. eat lunch and lay around again\u2026 then snorkel again.. then just sit for a \u00bd hr before you leave. We left at 10:15 am and didn\u2019t get back until a little after 6:30pm. It was not what I expected athough the snorkeling part was great. OH.. and make sure your sunscreen says BIODEGRADABLE or you have to buy theirs or not get in the water. The other trip we did was go to Captain Rick\u2019s for deep sea fishing. It was a 4 hour trip on the boat, they told us to get there at 8:30 and we probably didn\u2019t have orientation until 9:10 or so, then got split into groups of 5. My husband likes fishing and I don\u2019t mind it but we had different ideas of fishing. I want to do something! We basically just sat in the boat for 4 hours and drove around \u201ctrolling\u201d the whole time. The guy on the boat did everything. I never touched a thing, a rod, nothing. It was so hot and boring. We caught one fish and of course there are 5 of us on a boat and no one has a rod of their own so you just sorta pick who gets it. I was glad when it was over, I didn\u2019t think it was really worth the $90 per person. It was sort of like we were paying Captain Rick\u2019s men to fish, but whatever. I did get to see a dophin in the open water and caught a picture so that was my highlight of the day. At the hotel, we did the pool and the beach thing. I thought the pool was fine, it was never crowded and there was always a seat. We went to the beach which yes it beautiful but it is a bit of a walk. There are people selling necklaces and stuff on the beach. Unfortunately he caught us before we had done any shopping so the prices seemed ok, but later looking back it was steep. Plus one of them with a shark tooth on it broke, it was just super-glued on. All in all, the people were very nice although not always helpful. It was an experience and I can say I did it but next time I think I will spend my money somewhere else.", "Date": "August 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Honeymoon...Can't wait to return!\u201d", "Author": "Aims77", "ReviewID": "UR5611061", "Content": "First off, we arrived to the RIU on July 2, both of us were exhausted after a long day of flying, driving and having just been married the night before. When we arrived our bags were carried in for us, we went to the front desk and were greated with two wonderful bevarages. We were then handed our room key and headed down the long hallway to our room. I took note of the many reviews I had read on trip advisor, so I was able to compare my experience to others. I DID NOT notice a bit of mold anywhere in my room, I thoroughly inspected the couches because of the other reviews i had read, and saw NO MOLD!!! We had a junior suite and the balcony to just our room overlooked the fountain, and was HUGE!! After we settled in our room we headed down to the buffet, my one and only complaint is that my husband and I were not aware of the dress code and my husband was asked to change from shorts to pants JUST FOR DINNER which was a bit embarrassing, but after reading over the brochures we realized this was information we should have already known. The beach is beautiful, Never crowded, the pool was nice...never crowded we enjoyed the food at the mexican and italian restaurants during lunch. The beach was always empty after about 3:00 pm im not sure why, but we were virtually guarenteed an empty beach at around that time, which was so nice. We never got to partake in any of the restauraunts during the evening because we were gone on tours during the time of reservations, or just did not get up early enough, but we were okay with that. There was plenty of variety with each dinner and the the food was good, but you could always find something that was great. Each night was themed, they had seafood night, american night, mexican food night, italian food night, and Im sure there were others. The buffets were huge, always something to choose from, even at breakfast. Breakfast buffet was my favorite, so make sure you get up early to enjoy that. We enjoyed the bands each night, there was american and mexican music, some songs we even knew! I do recomend taking a cab to 5th street to do any shopping, that is where you can haggle and get a bargain. The staff is very friendly, and our room was always clean and we were always given fresh towels. We never got any towel art even after leaving the maid a $5 tip, so that was the last time we tipped the maid. All in all it was a wonderful resort and I do believe it is one of the best in the area.

The service at all levels cannot be faulted; the staff are happy and hard working - they are one of the main factors for our return. There are plenty of sunbeds round the pool and beach - none of this getting up early to reserve them. The pool never seems crowded. There is room service for breakfast if you're feeling lazy!

It was two weeks of being pampered. The hotel is very well managed and it shows in how fantastic ALL the staff are at the resort. There are so many wonderful staff at the resort it would be hard to mention them all to say thanks. I would not recommend this hotel for singles or people with children of almost any age. There is not a children's program to speak of and the resort is just not set up for children. It is definitely set up for adults and couples. The clientele is more on the reserved side. If you want a more \"happening\" place I would suggest the Riu Yucatan which is next door to the Palace and also right on the beach. We have also stayed at the Riu Yucatan and it is a wonderful resort with more action and a fantastic children's program. They have a really good pool area with a few bars and an atmosphere that is just more enjoyable for people that are more active. When we were there a few years ago children and teenagers alike seemed to really be enjoying themselves. There are discos at the Yucatan and Tequila also. The reason why I say this is that many people are disappointed in this not being a happening type place. We loved it but we are a bit older and do not come with any children. There are six Riu hotels in the area and you can visit all of them. There is the Riu Palace Riviera Maya, Riu Palace Mexico, Riu Yucatan, Riu Playacar, Riu Tequila, and Riu Lupita. The Riu Palace Mexico sits beside the Riu Yucatan with the Riu Tequila across the interlocking brick road. Even though the Tequila is not on the beach it has great access to the beach and if you don't want to take the short walk across the street you can catch the cart that will take you across and drop you off at the beach. The Riu Playacar is just a very short walk (toward Playa del Carmen) away from the Riu Palace Mexico (one hotel is between them). Then you need to walk past about four more hotels from the Playacar to get to the Riu Palace Riviera Maya. The Yucatan is on the opposite side of the Palace. You can also access (Yucatan, Palace Mexico, Playacar & Palace Riviera Maya) all the hotels from the beach or along the sidewalk . The Riu Lupita is a very long walk away (we walked it!) but it is not worth the effort. It is inland a fair bit and quite boring in my opinion. Playa del Carmen is about a 25 minute walk but you can always stop in at the Palace Riviera Maya for a bit of cool air and a drink and then continue along your way or you can take a taxi for $US5.00 each way. The food was very good. The buffet has a lot of variety. The ala carte restaurants are very good and not hard to book. If one wasn't available we just went to another.

As mentioned in other reviews found the rooms a little musty to start but didn't notice after that, definitely no mould. Rooms were spacious,clean and comfortable - even the beds which we found fine, although would prefer king size to 2 doubles pushed together. Felt service throughout the hotel was excellent from all staff we met, they were all friendly and polite. Enjoyed food at buffet very much and always loads to choose from, went to Brazilian, French and Steak House and found these very good also, good steak at French and steakhouse. Buffet was good as you could go when you wanted not having to be on a set mealtime. This is not a hotel to visit if you want entertainment as very low key in evenings although we picked for this reason. Very few children around, some babies and older teens but again it made for peaceful time around and in pool which suited us, as we were looking for a peaceful holiday together. Excellent service in Cubano bar and staff very friendly. Nice and cool too as very hot at outdoor bar even at night. Liked the fact that there is a small shopping area couple of hundred yards from hotel - nice to be able to walk out at night after dinner, unlike some other carribean places visited. Playa Del Carmen worth a visit with good shops, spent far too much on pressies to take home. Found we were in minority during 1st week being British (Welsh actually) and there were some very loud young Americans around but they had a short stay so bearable. We did meet some very nice people - american, canadian and british and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.

We felt mislead thinking that they will be kids programs in the Riu Mexico hotel itself. It turns out that we have to go to other Riu's kids program. Although not far the heat made any 10 min walk feels like 1/2 hour. Plus you had to bring your own towel to the other RIU's. We couldn't even make the walk to Playa Del Carmen. (Guess we just aren't sun worshippers) So save your energy and just take a cab to town. Prices for things aren't cheaper in town either. Infact my daughter bought a beaded purse that was $2 cheaper at the Plaza Del Carmen (across fr RIu Playacar) That was after haggling the price fr 12 USD to 8 USD. At Plaza Del Carmen only 6 USD to begin with. Food - well .. you can only eat so much. It was jaw dropping the first time when you walk into the restaurant. Overall we found the main meals very salty. The desserts selection seems better at lunch than dinner and didn't quite meet my expectations in selections and quality. My older daughter cut her leg going up the steps fr the pool bar to the deeper water. The cut was deep so we asked for a first aid attendant only to find out there isn't one at all! So we had to order a doctor to visit u at our room. It cost 90USD for consultation. He told us she needed at least 2 or 3 stitches but he couldn't perform it at the room since it wasn't a sterile environment. So we asked to go to his office which he mentioned was at RIU Yucatan and he said it wasn't sterile there either and that we had to go to the hospital to get it done. Thank God it was our last day there so we opt not to stitch and saw our our family doctor first thing Mon morning. So buy your travel insurance especially when you have children. The hotel isn't build with child safety in mind. As nice as it was to have a sunken living room in the suite itself - my younger daughter fell down the steps onto to hard tile floor. I was sure she twisted her ankle but luckily she was fine. Oh yes if you are a non smoker be prepare to second hand smoke. The one week stay there we second hand smoke equivalent to 2 years worth. You smell cigarette smoke the minute you step into the lobby to register. Coming from Vancouver it was hard for us. We couldn't even sit down to enjoy any of the nite shows. Some patrons smoke their Cuban cigars without a care in the world right inside the theater. So all in all we did have some memorable moments especially with the picturesque beach and palm trees. Would I go back to RIU Mexico ? NO. Maybe another beach another hotel.

First off, I will start by saying that if you don't have a great time at the Riu Palace, it is your own fault. This hotel was beautiful, the staff was amazing and we had the best, most relaxing and fun vacation ever. ROOMS: The rooms were very, very nice. You get what you pay for. We knew we weren't going to spend much time in the room, so we did not upgrade to an ocean view. We didn;t need it as we spent so much time at the beach. The rooms were spacious and clean, the bathroom was immaculate, the minibar was nice, and the staff always replenished the mini fridge every day with beer, water and soda. The only complaint I have is the bed situation. They put 2 queen beds together to make it a king bed. FOOD: The buffets were excellent, especially the breakfast buffet. You could eat for hours there. They had everything you could ever want for breakfast, and champagne too. The lunch buffets were standard lunch fare, and that was fine. The dinner buffets were great, and the food never ended. The specialty restaurants were pretty good. We went to the Japanese restaurant, which was nice, but we did not get enough food there. And it wasn't the best Japanese food. The Brazilian Steakhouse was top notch, I walked out very full. The only complaint I had was the reservation system, but we never had a problem getting a reservation and I couldn't think of a better, fairer way to handle the reservations. Just make sure you get on the reservation line by 8:15 if you want the Japanese restaurant. ENTERTAINMENT: The Animacion team was really great. Yes, some of the shows were cheesy, and actually, out of the 5 shows we saw, we only disliked one. There was usually a band playing at around 7:30pm , then the shows would start around 9:30. We saw a Michael Jackson show at the Yucatan and it was hilarious, and pretty good. POOL: I can't understand why I read so many negative reviews about the pool. The pool was beautiful, and clean and the pool bars were great, especially the swim up bar. If you want an olympic size swimming pool with diving boards, this is not the pool for you. If you want to cool off, relax, play water volleyball, have a drink and enjoy yourself, you'll love the pool. And never a problem getting a chair with shade either. Umbrellas are plentiful. STAFF: This was the best hotel staff ever. They went out of their way every minute we were there. The maids were great, the bartenders always topped off the drinks with an extra shot if you asked, the animacion team always tried to get people involved in events and games during the day. The beach party was a lot of fun. I never heard a no, or attitude. These people make peanuts but always had smiles on their faces and always made you feel like you were the only guests there. Tip them! BEACH: Saved the best for last. This beach was so beautiful, the sand was so nice, the palm trees were awesome. Never had trouble finding a chair, and we would move our chairs accordingly when the sun moved. We spent most of our days there, just relaxing and enjoying the water. The beach bar was great. They had a lot of beach sports, some included, some not. If you want to kayak or windsurf, you have to take a lesson, so don;t wait until the last day to do it like I did. Massages on the beach were a nice touch, and very reasonable. The only 2 times we spent money on this trip were the beach massages and parasailing. And tipping of course! You will have a great time at this hotel. The great thing is that you can use the other three Riu properties which surround the Palace (and they can't use the Palace). The Palace is very upscale, quiet and relaxing. If you want a more upbeat time, go to the Riu Yucatan next door, they were a lot of fun there and they also had a great pool. The Riu Tequila was good too, they had the nightclub for dancing and a sports bar, with pool tables and darts.They also had a fridge with snacks and sandwiches (free of charge) and is open 24 hours if you get that midnight craving. The lobby bar at the Palace also had snacks at night. You can have the best of both worlds in these hotels, depending on your mood. A vacation is what you make of it. Remember, you are not in the United States, so things are different, but you will have the best vacation ever here.

Food was good/great in buffet's no complaints, was a pain as always with their musical buffet, sorry it's 10:30 go to breakfast by the beach Don Julian is closed. Never got a chance to try gourmet resturants as we got held up doing other things, even though we made the reservation twice for Sir Edwards. No problem making these reservations, no one in line went at 8:30 once and once at 9:30. 2. Resort itself clean and beautiful, except for rooms will get to that at the end. 3. Pool adequate, good service at pool bar, is pool at Tequila, Yucatan and the RIU Palace RM nicer - yes - but this was good enough and we spent one afternoon at the other Palace and it was much more happening with music and fun bartenders etc. 4. Beach was beautiful, beach bar was great, make it the way you want, also had drink service with pre-made drinks. Did Catamaran with a guide, They want you to take 4 lessons for 90 dollars total to take it out on your own for 1 hr a day. It cost us $30 to go with the guide and we were out there for about 1.5 hrs was worth it. They say Non-motorized is free, but believe me they try to get you to buy something, go on snorkeling excursion instead of beach. Also lots of people selling stuff on beach, prices ok, haggeled and bought a couple of bracelets. 5. Disco over at Tequila - great just like RIU Cancun and the bartenders work so hard! 6. Shows, too boring for me, but some might like it. Bands were good to sit and listen too. 7. Staff - not what I expected, as I mentioned went to RIU Cancun in Dec (just opened after Hurricane) and the staff was outstanding and so happy to see us and serve us. Some staff here was great, others should be fired(Joel you know who you are). Maids - great, Dining Staff-great, Front Desk-negative, Bartenders-varied. 8. Free transfers with holtel: only ones on bus up to resort, 3 families on way back - handled very well. 9. Other RIU resorts spent time at Tequila, Yucatan and RPRM, all seemed good and different. 10. Pharmacy at Yucatan is about 40% higher than the one across the street from the Palace in the Plaza and they have more selection over there. 11. Now for the BIG negative, and I rarely complain about anything and was expecting great things from this resort. THEY HAVE A SERIOUS MOLD PROBLEM! I am quite aware this is the jungle and it's humid etc, etc. 1st room terrible mold moved and tipped an extra $20 to get a 2nd room with a BIGGER problem. The mold was so bad, the pillows were black with it, in the closet, in the shower, on the curtains in the room. Air conditioner broke and thought after this was fixed it would go away it did not - it got worse. The smell was unbearable by the last night and I was sick (visit to the pharmacy for a Z-pack). I know this mold made me sick, kept me up for 2 nights. It was so bad when I opened my suit case after getting home - everything smelled from being in that room - had to wash it all. I went and showed them the pillow and covers at the front desk (since I had came down earlier to try and talk about it and they didn't care) and Joel was extremely rude to me, as I stood there with my fever and bronchitis - shooed me away telling me Senioria go home, you are free to go. I don't know where he came from, but he should take a lesson from the majority of his hispanic co-workers on customer service. He then accused me of making phone calls that were never made and trying to charge me for them. I tried to explain the room change, but again he wouldn't listen to a word I was saying and kept rudely telling me to leave. Unreal - I will never stay here again due to the mold and the rude staff. I guess he didn't appreciate me bringing the problem to him in the Lobby.", "Date": "July 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pensylvania", "Title": "\u201cwonderful but a few disappointments\u201d", "Author": "steelers77", "ReviewID": "UR5522304", "Content": "My mother and two sisters and I stayed at the hotel at the end of July.

The Brazillian was good, but the waiter served six types of meat, too much meat for our liking, so we sampled. Making reservations was an inconvenience. We tried to do this before breakfast. The waiter/ress service was fantastic. They were extremly hardworking and friendly. The drinks were watered down. Unless you got them from the pol bar (some of them were even too strong). They only have Corona, which I didn't think it would matter, but it did after the third day. Bringing a thermos were a geat tip! After dinner we would sit outside in the open patio and listen to a band. It was practically the same music each night. The shows were cheesy, but it was entertainment. After the band stopped playing (around 11:00), everyone seemed to go in. We would hang out at the Cubana bar near the lobby. Quiet atmosphere, but there was nothing else to do. As other people have stated, go to another hotel if this is a priority. Pool was great, it is sectioned off so that you can go to a quieter side. It was unfortunate that kids hung out near the pool bar since that seemed to be where their parents were. No problem finding chairs. The beach is one of the largest at a resort. No umbrellas, didn't see any waiters. However, there is a bar that is opened (until about 5:00-6:00ish). Someone mentioned that they were unable to change their money back into American money. They have a bank in the Plaza Playcar (which is across the street). You are able to get pesos from the ATM and exchange money at the bank. Shopping: Be aware that the items they have at the hotel in the evening are COMPLETELY overpriced!!! I saw a wall hanging (of The Last Supper) for about $40-$50. I saw it at the Cancun Airport for $12.99! Shopping at 5th Ave was fun, again, watch the jewlery stores. Bring a small umbrella with you, one minute it is beautiful, the next it is could be pouring. Speaking of shopping, if you want to buy cheap alcohol, wait till you get to the airport. Their duty free shop near the gates were much cheaper than they were in town. In case you need medicine, there is a pharmacy in the plaza (and at the RIU Tucan). I would bring Immodium! Concerning excursions: Be prepared that you have to pick up and drop off people at other hotels. We went on three excursions, and it took about an hour from picking us up to getting us to our destination. I don't know if there is a way you can pay for the excursion and not the transportation, and just get a cab...but it would be worth it!!! Major disappointments of the hotel: Our tiolet overflowed around 9:30 pm. We called the front desk. No one showed up until midnight (and after a few more calls)!!! No maid service showed up to clean the floor that evening. In the morning, we woke up to a running tiolet. The entire bathroom was flooded and ran into the hallway. I went to the front desk. They could not change our rooms since none were available. Within 10 min it was fixed. We had to wait about a half an hour to get into the bathroom for the bathroom to be sanitized. Second disappointment: When we were about to check out, we had to pay a doctors bill. We wanted to pay by cedit card. The man at the front desk said that their lines were down and the machine was not working. He told us that we had to pay cash. My mother used all of the rest of her cash that she had in her pocket. After she paid the bill, we asked what would he have done if she didn't have the cash. He stated that he would have given her a voucher. Then he changed his story and said that he didn't have any vouchers when my mother wanted a voucher instead of her not having any cash on the way home. This was unethical. A lot of the places down there prefer you to pay cash...but this was uncalled for. Riu Palac Mexico was the classiest RIU hotel. We enjoyed our stay and had a wonderful trip. But we will not be going back on count of the insincerity of their service on what really matters.", "Date": "July 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful, but please NO SURVEYS at dinner...\u201d", "Author": "teddyz", "ReviewID": "UR5516584", "Content": "We stayed at RIU Palace Mexico for 4 nights.

We were appalled at their boldness and presuming attitidues. RIU needs to change the practice of asking patrons to complete surveys during dinner and in the plain site of staff - highly suggest to move to an online survey system- and RIU needs to further discuss with staff the inappropriateness of confronting patrons, during dinner, to question their surveys.

My husband and I stayed in an adequate room; but unfortunately, on May 7th a Nikon 5600 Coolpix digital camera and two braceletts were stolen from our room. My husband and I had unpacked on the 6th of May, and the camera was in our carry-on bag. The camera is valued with the case, battery charger, and our extended warranty at $500. This unfortunately is not covered under our renter's insurance, so this is quite a loss for us. It also had pictures from our honeymoon, and other sentimental pictures, which is very upsetting. The camera was setting above the mini fridge in our room, and we noticed it was missing when we wanted to take it to Playa del Carmen the evening of May 7th, 2006. The braceletts were a secondary loss, however, I was so distracted by the camera being missing, that I did not notice the braceletts were missing until May 8th. I suppose they could have been missing on the 7th as well. The braceletts were left by the sink in the bathroom. My husband made a report at the front desk, however, the person he spoke to said that he would check with the maids to see if they knew anything. That to me was an unacceptable response, since they or whoever turned down the beds at night were the likely culprits. Although the items stolen was a misfortune, I felt the way Riu Palace Mexico handled it very poorly. I emailed them on 5/10, 5/15, 5/16, 5/21, 5/22, 6/30 and 7/26 all of 2006. The person who was supposed to respond to me never did. In late July, I did receive a blanket email, stating that I never made a report at the hotel, which is a lie (I did file a complaint), and they also said they were not responsible. So, basically no compensation! I want to make those who may be traveling to Mexico aware, PLEASE do not go to Riu Palace Mexico in Playa del Carmen. Although the hotel itself is okay, many of the workers have sticky fingers!!!

I can't say enough about this resort. The service was superior (this is coming from a finicky traveler). The grounds were immaculate and the resort was quite clean. The food was good (not excellent). I highly recommend La Bodega (Brazilian rodizio). The food was great there. The Japanese restaurant wasn't so great (not worth going to). Don Julian (buffet) was awesome! The breakfast buffet was the best! I didn't have a chance to get to the the Italian restaurant or the steakhouse (both restaurants were outdoors)--too hot! The drinks at the pool and beach weren't very strong while the lobby bar drinks were super strong. The staff was very attentive at the all the bars. The rooms were spacious and clean and we even had towel animals on our beds (see pic). There were only a few things that I really didn't like about the resort: First and foremost, the BEDS! Unless you like a super firm mattress, you aren't going to get much sleep. Also, you are given an actual room key for your room (no cards) and the room # in on the keychain. Um..hello? If someone found your room key, they would know exactly where to go to clean you out! Speaking of keys, you are given your room safe lock and key upon check-in. You actually put the lock into the safe door in your room (kinda out of date?). Finally, restaurant reservations...you need to get in line at 8am to get a reservation at all the restaurants (except the buffet). The line stretched throughout the room to make a reservation! Not only that, you need to make a reservation every day! You can't make all your reservations for the week at the same time. I am sure there is a better system to do this! Overall, I highly recommend this resort. I've been to many all-inclusive resorts, and I have to say that the Riu definitely ranks at the top.

We had a very good time overall. Here is my review of the Riu Palace Mexico. Resort - Excellent, well maintained. Rooms - Good air cond. clean, maintained 2 times a day. TV was a bit small, but who watch TV anyway. Food - Buffet was excellent, qaulity was certainly above the average. Too bad we just came back from Vegas a few weeks ago and was spoiled from the great food in Vegas. But comparing to other resorts in the area, I think it is very good. Only complaint may be too much similiarity between days. The speciality restaurants were very poor. A friend that we met at the resort got sick after having dinner in one of these restaurants. Drinks - Excellent! name branded drinks. Beer and pops in bottles. I especially enjoyed the coffee with Baileys after dinner. Entertainment - I hated it. They keep having Mr. Riu and Mrs Riu contest all the time. I was hoping to get entertained, not to entertain others. Pool - Small, but you can always walk over to the other Riu resorts. Beach - Beautiful. Service - Poor. Besides the general lack of smiles, I did encounter the following small issues: 1. Everyday, just before 8AM, the cleaning staff were having a party to talk about their life time stories in the hallway outside of my room. 2. For 2 days, there was nobody at the front door to call a taxi for us. No big deal, but this is not what I expected from a 5+ star resort. 3. One morning, I only get my first cup of coffee after ordering it 3 times. Overall, I would still give RIU in other locations a try, as we found Riu Palace in Cancun was very nice.

We were a little surprised by how may kids and teens were there, but they were not loud or crazy- they were fine. The shows were not terrific, but the theatre is very small. We actually went to some of the shows next door that were a little nicer. Rooms were very nice- I little bit dated, but not bad at all. Everyone is correct, very hard beds. I like a firm mattress, but even with a mattress pad- very hard. Overall the hotel is beautiful. Any and all tours that you may want to do is available every morning in the lobby (we did too many to recommend). Playa del Carmen is nice, a bit touristy for my tastes. An absolute MUST DO in playa is have dinner, or at least drinks, at ALUX- beyond exceptional (If you enjoy having a great candlelite dinner inside an amazing cave with live music)!

We had an EXCELLENT time! This was our first all-inclusive experience after visiting Playa del Carmen three times previous in the past five years, and it was an outstanding experience. The goal of this trip was total relaxation, lots of great beach and sun, and a little pampering. The RIU Palace delivered on all counts. Let me see if I can address the kinds of things people reading Trip Advisor for this hotel likely are looking for. At minimum, here are the things I was looking for when I was reading these same posts...hopefully they'll be helpful to you as well. My guess is that either you're considering booking here, or you already have and now you're reading as much as you can to prepare and get excited, and to set your mind at ease about the decision you've recently made. WEATHER: Excellent. Seven days there, it only rained one day for half the day, beginning at 8 a.m. and lasting until about 3 p.m. For us, it was a blessing, as we'd had two full days of sun at that point and were a little lobstery anyway. Rest of the time, sun sun sun and temps hovering in the upper 80s (F) to lower 90s. BEACH: The RIU Palace Mexico may have one of the best sections of beach in the entire Playa area. Not only is the water excellent this time of season, but the beach itself is wide, clean, free of rocks and seaweed, and crystal clear blue. Like a post card, only better, because you're in it. You want sun...great! Use the many deck chairs on the front section of beach that are completely exposed. Want sun and shade interchangably, stay 75 meters or so back from the water's edge on one of the many beach chairs set amidst the many palm trees that offer plenty of shade. Drinks - alcoholic and non - are avaible at a little beach bar, and occasionally, staff will bring out trays of drinks for you to enjoy. CLEANLINESS OF HOTEL: Beyond being eco-friendly by using products like vinegar to clean floors, the place is impeccably clean. The staff seem to work non-stop to keep the place clean. We walked by an open room door one morning to see one of the cleaning crew on her hands and knees hand-scrubbing the floor of a guest's room! Towels are brought to you in the evening as well as being replenished in the morning when the room is cleaned. Our room was top floor, and had no musty smell or mildew. Common areas of the hotel are immaculate. STAFF: Friendly, attentive, not in your face and seemingly excited to serve you! Unless you are one of those brash, loud, mouthy American-types (I'm American, I know who you are and so do you) who is spoiled rotten and just can't be quiet and enjoy some time in serenity, you're going to be treated wonderfully. WHO'S STAYING HERE? / MIX OF CULTURES: Less Europeans in general and more Americans in general than other places we've stayed...my guess is that it has something to do with the all-inclusive nature. That said, this was not some loud, overbearing Cancun experience AT ALL. People in general here were a bit more sophisticated than the average traveler in all the right ways. There are definitely families here, though not predominantly. And the kids and young adults staying at this place, at least while we were there, have learned their manners and know how to have fun without being a slow, simmering psychological drain on their neighbors. ENTERTAINMENT: This is not Vegas or Broadway...you've been warned. We saw a slightly creepy \"Michael Jackson\" show that was complete with dancers and coreograhpy and a guy that was a dead ringer for the King of Pop. Billy Jean is not my lover, indeed. For an even creepier time, try the other RIU Palace floor show, which one evening featured kids from the resort singing a song that translated English words into Spanish words, and was led by a guy dressed from the set of Grease the muscial, a cowboy, a guy in very stereotyped authentic Mexican wear, a clown and a guy in a Batman costume. This ensemble, if you can call it that, takes us deeply into a relm most of us seldom wish to willingly travel, and they do it without the benefit of context. The fact that it didn't make any sense whatsoever was such an all-encompassing focal point for my brain as I watched it unfold that I was left paralyzed in my seat and unable to escape its pull. Perhaps it's Mexican culture's obsession with the variety show that refracted this particular Tour de Force...whatever it was, it left both of us scarred. HOW'S THE FOOD? Outstanding for a largely buffet-driven experience. There is no way to possibly experience all that is to offer, and attempting to do so could easily result is some less-than-intelligent food pairing decisions you'll pay for later on. No matter how much your eyes tell you the mango yogurt with granola will be fine to eat along side three different types of Danishes, a stack of pancackes, two different sausage varieties, a brick of bleu cheese and a green drink, PACE YOURSELF. You have several days...no need to do it all each day. We only ate once not at the evening buffet, and it was the Brazilian place. While good, it simply doesn't compare to the convenience of the buffet and it's overall quality. You also should venture into town one night...don't forget...Playa's got some GREAT restaurants.

The hotel hasn't changed a bit since it opened. The property itself is still well kept, neatly manicured and exquisitely maintained. Most of the staff hasn't changed too much and we recognized many of our favorite people from our last visit. We also had the pleasure of meeting the hotel director and the PR managers during our stay. Our only concern was the reservation system. You had to line up most mornings before 8:30 a.m. in order to get reservations for the following day to the a la carte restaurants. On most days there were at least 100 people in line. We don't like to waste precious beach time in lines. The rooms were the same as we remembered. We had a courtyard and partial sea view room in the first building. The chambermaid was great and worked so hard each day to make sure the room was kept spotless. We made sure not to overlook the staff's hard work and made certain to tip the waiters, bartenders and room cleaning staff frequently. All in all a wonderful trip to a wonderful hotel. We did pay a visit to the new Riu Palace Riviera Maya just 10 minutes away from our hotel. It is a beautiful new property situated a bit closer to the town of Playa Del Carmen's shopping district. The hotel seemed larger but we did not care for the beach area. There is a breakwall at the edge of the hotel and a very narrow beach. Our hotel has one of the nicest beaches in the area so if you are a beach person you may want to check this out before booking the other Riu. The only thing that made me a bit jealous was their gym facility. The Riu Palace Mexico has there original gym ( the hotel opened in 1999). The wear and tear on the equipment has resulted in one barely working treadmill and two stationary bikes. There are free weights and other weight equipment but it needs a complete overhaul. The gym at the new Riu Palace Riviera Maya is gorgeous. Their equipment is state-of-the-art and the gym itself is beautifully designed. When I spoke to the Hotel Director she explained that within the next year they should be doing a renovation and getting some new equipment for the gym. It is simply too small and out of date to handle the capacity of the hotel. If you are looking for a first class holiday experience you can't go wrong with the Palace.

Has swim up bar, banana mama sin alcohol was my favorite. They have free activities everyday that you can do, such as volleyball, the volleyball instructer was amazing, Miguel is the best. There are several water sports to do. This is a great vacation for the young and old. I loved it and I can't wait to return.

We decided on this hotel when picking our honeymoon. There is not one bad thing I can say about this hotel. To tell you all the positives, the customer service was excellent, everyone working the hotel always had a smile on their faces. Beach was beautiful, so many chairs, there were more than enough chairs. The bartenders were all so genorous with the alcohol, never at any point did I have a weak drink. Moy was such a sweetie, he was our bartender at the poolbar everyday. Hello Moy! Maid service our room was always clean with towel animals to greet us when we came back from the beach. Ever meal there was always something of your liking. I am a picky eater trust me, my new husband who I absolutely adore will tell you how picky I am, I had no problem in finding something I like. I will have to say Sir Edwards has the best steak, both my husband and I loved it. It was so tender. But the buffets were also good. They have a theme everynight. Presentation of the food was like as if you were eating at a five star restaurant. Servers at all the restaurants and buffet they were always on the ball. When you had a half full drink they were bringing you another one. Entertainment at night was good. One night that we were there they put on a Grease show it was really good and another night they had this competition, they picked four men from the audience and my husband was one of the picks, they had to compete to become MR.RIU and my husband was MR.RIU for the week and there were servers and audience members that remember him throughout the week and would greet him as MR.RIU which is kinda funny. So as you can tell my husband and I had a wonderful honeymoon.

We are a active younger couple in our mid-late twenties. We were looking for an upscale location that wasn't adults only, yet had minimal children. Overall, the resort was very nice & up to our expectations. The atmosphere was very elegant & more upscale than other hotels. The landscaping, the grounds, the lobby, the courtyard, the fountains, etc - was always being tended to by staff members who would great you with \"hola\" or Buenos Dias\". The hotel is 1 of 4 ( 5 total - one 10 mins down the road. ) RIU properties right next door to each other which made it easy for side / day trips to the other RIU resorts. Airport: No issues to speak of, in & out of customs in 15 mins or less. I would definitely recommend flying on MON-THU as the airports were a breeze. We heard several complaints about some people waiting 1 - 3 + hours for check in / customs on the weekends. Front Desk: We were greeted with a drink and welcomed with courtesy & professionalism. This was our honeymoon & I was a little surprised that the front desk made no mention of the occasion after reading over our package / itinerary. Rooms: Good & adequate, nothing to fancy but nice. . The room we were originally given was 1014 & no welcome / honeymoon package was there upon my wife & I's entrance. She was a little disappointed as was I. The view was facing the walkway of the RIU next-door & although OK, not appealing. We grabbed a couple beers out of the cooler, turned up the AC & headed down to the pool, beach & to explore. We returned a couple hours later to find the room still warm, the AC didn\u2019t work\u2026 I returned to the front desk, explained the situation & they stated no rooms were available, to come back tomorrow. I also advised that this was our honeymoon & there was no welcome/honeymoon package. I tipped the man a $20.00 and said I would be back tomorrow afternoon & would appreciate any assistance. I returned the following day, the gentleman I was working with was gone but did make mention to the shift manager who transferred us to a courtyard facing room, #3260 & I tipped the manager a $20 as well. No honeymoon package in this room either, and none ever showed up. MiniBar: Not all its cracked up to be. The fridge filled with cold coronas, water & sodas gets an A in my book, but the 4 bottles which people seem to rave about is not all it's cracked up to be. Ice is a commodity in Mexico & there were no working Ice Machines - a 90 degree rum & coke or hot shot of tequila doesn't work so well. It would have been great if you could make a cold mixed drink in the room, but we would just head down to the bar. Maid Service: Was very good, almost too good. There were times people would check on the room 4 or 5 times during the day, even as late as 8 in the evening - knocking & opening. HINT : use the do not disturb sign - LOL ;) . We tipped the made 1/2 a day & she made several towel animals during our stay. Pool: The entire place was beautiful & the pool was nice but it just didn't compare with the grand scale of the resort. Although not massive in size, there were ALWAYS chairs available, no matter what time of the AM or PM. The pool served it's purpose but just didn't appear on the same level as the upscale resort. Beach: Amazing, just like all the others say, it is huge & again you never ever had an issue getting a chair / lounger. The beach on the other hand was very nice and impressive. The soft sand, azul waters and slight summer breeze is something we will never forget and reminiss about today. Very Impressive overall. Food: We tried all the restaurants including specialty / reservation ones. At first I would wake up early every AM, wait in line with about a 100 others & even with a long line first thing in the AM we were usually out in 10 mins. Near the end of the trip I just strolled in casually at 9:30 or close to 10 & never had an issue getting a table. . Our favorite was Myagi's for the setting & food. The ice carvings, the melon carvings, the selection was expansive. The food was good, not great but the selection was definitely there. I never thought I would get tired of the food, the quality was good, service great but by the 7th day it did get a bit repetitive. The service was impeccable however, on the spot, some of the best I've had. We tipped 5.00 at the specialty restaurants. Drinks: As others suggested we brought mugs, a MUST. It is warm / humid so nothing is super cold or stays cold for to long. The bartenders were all friendly and very laidback. If you wanted more alcohol, simply ask. I would also recommend calling out your liquors ( absolute, Smirnoff, etc ) if you want them or they use the house brand. We brought plenty of ones & would tip most of the day. Atmosphere: Again elegant, overall a beautiful resort with an adult feel. Lots of different cultures & people from all over the globe, Asian, Canadian, American, with a large percentage of European's. There was little to no language barrier with staff & guests alike, everyone was in an upbeat mood which made it very pleasant. Nights could be spent in the courtyard listening to music or relaxing. IT was a very quiet place at night, not a lot to do, but you were only a 5.00 cab ride to downtown or a walk across the street to the disco ( hit n miss but FUN ). Downtown: Was very cool, lots of shops, vendors, etc\u2026 Much busier on Fri / Sat / Sun nights at the dance club / hot spots like Blue Parrot & Senor Frogs. We had a blast & the Swing bars & met some very cool bartenders, locals & others on vacation just like us. The RIU Palace Mexico is a very elegant / upscale hotel & a very nice place to stay on a honeymoon or vacation. Overall it was a great place and we would definitely stay here again. Will we ONLY stay here again, no. Although we were thoroughly impressed with the hotel I am still eager to see what else Playa & other RIU locations have to offer. The RIU chain did impress us & we will be looking at staying with them in the future.", "Date": "June 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cYup, It's Great (And That's From a Cynical New Yorker!)\u201d", "Author": "NYDJGuy", "ReviewID": "UR5411996", "Content": "To put it quite simply, this one was of the best hotels we've stayed at (my girlfriend agrees) any price level (were talking Motel 6 up through the Four Seasons). The service was just about perfect - immediately when we sat down at dinner, the pool, the beach, the nighttime shows, we were offered drinks. The grounds were immaculate; I've never seen grass cut that perfectly (the grounds were always being attended to and we never even heard them working on it). The attitude of the staff at the Riu Palace is: \"What can I do for you?\" which is how it should be when you go on vacation. They even didn't try to rip you off for Internet acceess! But of course, nobody or thing is completely perfect, and being fussy New Yorkers, we did notice a few things that could make this hotel even better: 1) Room Keys - Not only are they actual keys (not computer key cards), they have the room numbers printed right on them. Now you maybe saying, \"quit your complaining!\" but this is a pretty serious security issue. The key is basically saying: \"Hi, if you've found me, my guests are at the beach, so feel free to come rob us!\" I haven't seen keys like this since the Reagan Era, so they should be updated, or at least take the room numbers off! 2) The Food - The Don Julian (main buffet) had an excellent selection and the food quality was good. Yes, we were paranoid about eating the fruits and vegetables at first, but we gave in and we were okay. The Riu claims to wash this stuff in purified water, and here we are 2 weeks later, alive and well. As for the Speciality restaurants, they were fair at best (I know, I know, the New York foodie-wannabes maybe a little critical). But the Steakhouse steak quality was barely Applebee's, and the \"fancy\" place -- I think it was \"Gourmet\" was \"eh.\" Again, these comments are just for the food, the service was excelllent at both places. We didn't try the Japanese (there was no way we thought the sushi would cut it) or the Brazilian. And again, I'm not comparing these restaurants to Peter Luger's or Le Bernadin, etc. I'm comparing them to the Don Julian buffet, and they were not as good. 3) Nighttime Entertainment - One nice touch at the Riu: you can hop on over to any other Riu property in the area. So after the night shows (kinda cheesy -- yes, one night they had couples popping balloons on each other ---but you can't expect Broadway), you could go over to the Riu Tequila (right across the street), where there's a sports bar and a club complete with 90's dance favorites. I know the Riu Palace is supposed to be more upscale, and not as \"partyish,\" but it would be nice to have something to do after the show. They had some good bands playing, but they were doing so as the show was going on, which made no sense. So you would come out of the show say about 10:45pm, the band would play 2 sounds, and then pack it in. Huh?!?! Start the band AFTER the show ends, and play 'til about 12am. 4) Beach and \"Umbrella, umbrella!\" - Yes, the beach is a little crowded and not too wide, but it was very well maintained, despite seeing lots of cups, and papers left at the end of the day (what's wrong with people?). There were no issues getting a lounge chair, but I think they should have umbrellas for pasty types (like myself) who like to sit in the sun for one day, and then hide because he is burned, even while wearing 45! Sorry, I digress. So yea, beach umbrellas (like they have at the pool) would be nice. And that's really it for the nitpicks. Great place, great service at a very reasonable price. I asked the staff if this Riu was just exceptional because it was a higher end Riu, and they assured me that all the Rius have this level of service. If that's the case, we'll definitely consider others!", "Date": "June 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent", "Title": "\u201cRiu Palace was above expectations!\u201d", "Author": "pinkpurplejohn", "ReviewID": "UR5407710", "Content": "Me and my boyfriend stayed here from 11-23 June and had an amazing vacation. I also studied this website before we departed, but words cannot describe just how beautiful and well kept the grounds of the Riu Palace are kept. FOOD-Great choice, nice feature each night at the buffet. What you could actually have for breakfast was amazing, fruit, vegetables, meat, beans, champagne! OK well it's not actually champagne but the sparkling wine is not bad. As for the evening meals, the speciality restaurants are a great touch, and yes you do have to book in advance in the morning, but generally if you're there for around 9-9:30 you'll get a reservation, unless of course you have a party of 8 which you may have to que when bookings start at 8:30. What's the harm in that? You're in beautiful mexico, who want's to stay in their rooms and sleep?!? ROOM-Good not great decor, spacious, clean, the maids came twice a day and our minibar was filled daily. Always supplied with clean towells when needed. Beds were really not too hard, def not that you would have noticed if you had not read all the reviews that stated that. Upon arrival I requested a room on the 2nd floor, and we had 2056, which had a great view of the ocean, pool and also could see the court yard but essentially overlooked the fountains - perfect! Def no mould to be found, must have been some unlucky people but I couldn't find a single dot! SERVICE-Fantastic I found the Mexican staff couldn't help me enough, so warm and welcoming which is strange to begin with as you get the feeling this is for tips, but soon learn that this is their nature, we saved tipping until the end of our stay which was greatly appreciated! The service here was better than i have ever received, and one of the hotels trademarks, keeping the palace at the top of its game! ENTERTAINMENT-Again better than expected, pretty much slammed by previous reviews, but I found it to be enjoyable, varied and really got the crowd going. If you dont like it here then visit one of the other Riu hotels on the complex where their will be something to suit everyone from live music, dance shows, disco, or fun and games on stage with the hotel guests. The 'nightclub' disco at the Riu Tequila was a great place to go if you still wanted to dance after hours, although it does have a strange smell and I'd stick to drinks from the hotel bars as this was the only place I found them to be watered down...even the shots! The Sports bar at the Tequilia was definately another high point of our holiday what with the world cup and NBA finals on, it was quite full most of the time, but the service here is amazing, you can also grab snacks and they have internet connection (and the best air con) Ok now the rest.....The beach was beautiful, there is shade, not alot no, but who goes to the beach to hide away in the shade! There are always hammocks available and some days activities run on the beach which was another nice touch watching the salsa dancers! Pool was fine, didnt think it was small at all. You have the loud side (pool bar and volley ball) and the quiet side which was nice to cool down go for a little swim.

I must say that, in agreement with previous reviewers, the groundsof the Riu Palace are beautiful and are truely kept spotless. We chose to have our wedding at the Riu Palace and it was absolutely beautiful, our wedding coordinator Cynthia was FABULOUS! But it was very difficult trying to get in touch with her proir to our arrival. Nevertheless , she really knew what she was doing, and our wedding turned out wonderful. That being said, I was very disappointed with several aspects of our stay. First, with our wedding, we were to recieve a complimentary room upgrade. Now, when we booked our stay we had already reserved an upgraded suite. Upon check in they tried to tell us that they did not have any jacuzzi suites available for 3 days, and even then we may not get the upgrade! I was livid! However after talking with the hotel manager, they miraculosly had an available suite, oceanview, with a jacuzzi. Amazing! Another, surprising thing I found was that all of the table linnens were dirty!! Gross!! they didn't change them when people spilled food and drinks all over them, they just wiped them off and sat acted as if it was ok! At a hotel that is rated 5 star, I expect clean table linens!! Same with the ou room, the window treatments were dirty and the bedspread had cigarette burns in it. My parent's and our friend's rooms were fine. One of our guests traveling alone was pu t in a room that had all of the appliances and air conditioning turned off and unplugged. When she finally was assigned to a different room, she was asked to transport her luggage herself, also not ok at a 5 star hotel. I tipped the maid $10 a day and we only recieved towel animals the first day we arrived and the day after our wedding. We never recieved a fruit basket or a gift that was supposed to be delivered as part of our wedding, and we never recieved our breakfast in bed the morning following our wedding. As for the pool, the restaurants, the beach, all were excellent. I agree that the palace has the nicest beach in the area, and I too have been all over the Carribean and Hawaii. The beach is great for adults and children, but yes there are topless sunbathers. All in all, it was a great vavcation, but I think if you are going expecting the best of the best you may be disappointed. I was addicted to this site before we left and I went expecting absolute luxury, it was close, but not top notch. P.S. If you have an early departure flight, beware, they have no bellman before 7am! We almost missed our bus! we called to have a bellman sent and the front desk said they would send one in 5 minutes, then called back and said they would send one at 7! Our bus left at 7:10 and We were in the very, very last room of the hotel (were traveling for a wedding, do you have nay idea how long it would have taken us to get all of our luggage to the front!!) The bar was open at 7am, but they don't have bellman ?!?! This was the Riu Palace Mexico not the Riu Palace Party! Also, the bed are really hard, everyone was right!

I honestly don't know why anyone could complain about that. ROOM: We stayed in a fountain view jr. suite 0062. It had a living area with a sofa, a coffee table, tv and a small patio. The room was a great location. Right across from the fountain so it drowned out the activities in the courtyard. Great central location from the main area and the pool/beach. Room was clean and AC controlled. so if it was too hot you could adjust it yourself. Yes, the bed and pillows were hard but we were too tired every night to care! AND who watches TV anyway. FOOD: Excellent. There is something for everyone. Even the pickiest eater can find something. The restaraunts for dinner were wonderful. Service again here, FABULOUS! you need to get up to make reservation at 8:30 - 10:00. Not a big deal for an early riser. the line was quick. Then after, i got my coffee and walked to the beach or went to the gym. GYM: For fitness people, it was a little dated but really, are you there to relax or workout. IT served its purpose! BEACH: Excellent! There were plenty of chairs. The palm trees are slowly making there recovery but there was shade to find. Not much in the way of chair to chair drink service bu there is a beach bar a few steps away. DRINKS: Very yummy. If you ask for more liqour, they'll give it too you. No problemo! I took a cooly cup. Well worth it. POOL: Didn't spend a lot of time there. This is definately a beach resort! but the pool was nice. Again plenty of chairs and umbrellas when we went. ACTIVITIES: The activities people are a hoot. It was fun to break up the day with volleyball or a stretching class. Don't be shy.... you meet alot of fun people. I'd recommend to do something at least once. The shows at night are little cheesey but this isn't broadway gang! Have a sense of humor and enjoy a night out under the stars with your loved one or family! TOWN: A cab will take you there for $5. Don't walk.... HOT!!! We went during the day and at night. Alot to see. I recommend going to 5th avenue... very pretty! Have a beer at Senor Frogs and relax. Overall, we had a great honeymoon. We enjoyed Playa and each other.

A group of 12 couples went ranging from 30's to 40's. We all had an excellent time. A group of us have been traveling to Cancun and Playa for the past 8 yrs. looking for the perfect location and I think we finally found it! Check-in: Easy and fast. I do have to say that last year the resort was overbooked, so they sent our group to the Moon Palace in Cancun which was not nice. They provided us with vouchers to come back this year to stay complimentary. We made sure to confirm our reservations this year! Rooms: The size of the resort is really nice. It is smaller and easier to get around. The rooms are comfortable and clean. We had a room on the second floor and it was cold always stocked with fresh towels and drinks. The beds are hard, but we always slept great in the cold dark room. Beach: Best we have ever been to. There is a large sandy area with a bar, volleyball court, chairs and hammocks that is wonderful. There are plenty of chairs and the beach and water are beautiful. You don't have to get up early to get a chair by the beach or pool. It is also not as crowded as some because it is a smaller resort. Pool: The pool is very nice, but not a typical huge winding pool. Not many activities or noise at the pool, but it's nice to not get bugged constantly to participate in water aerobics etc. Our group would relax out on the beach all day, then come in about 4:00 to play water volleyball and hang out at the pool bar. It would be nice if the pool bar stayed open later, but I think most resort pools close at 6:00. Drinks and food: The drinks are really good. If they are not strong enough for you just get a topper of alcohol or just request how you want a drink made. It would be nice to have an insulated mug because the beer can get warm in the heat. The bar lobby made really good drinks, or maybe they just tasted better in a glass instead of a platic cup! The food was excellent. There were plenty of choices at the buffet and wonderful fresh cheeses, fruits, and vegetables. There were several meat choices beef, shrimp, pasta bar etc. If you can't find something to like at this buffet you would have to almost be unable to please. The Myagi Japanese restaurant was wonderful. The sushi was actually really good and fresh. The Steak restaurant was great also. Half of our friends ate at the French and said it was really good. I think the least favorite was the Brazilian, but still good. You do have to wake up early to make dinner reservations. We had early risers, so they booked our reservations for the people who wanted to sleep in. The restaurant by the beach was great for lunch. The guacamole and pico are wonderful on anything. The grilled fish and fajitas were always good. Overall the food is fresh, replenished quickly and a large variety is always offered. Entertainment: We never watched the shows, so I can't comment on that. The lobby bar was fun to relax and have drinks after dinnner. We went to the disco at the Riu Tequila across the street and it was fun, but extremely hot. If you want a lively, rocking place this might not be a good choice for you. I would have to say that at least the four days that we were there it would be placed in the lively category! It can be as quiet or as fun and crazy as you want it to be. I would reccomend this resort to couples, but not really a family resort.

There were 50 of us staying at the hotel and we believe we are talking on everybody's behalf with the below review: The hotel is magnificent and we have never experienced such incredible service before. None of our guests ever felt neglected. The rooms are large with a sitting area. They are cleaned neatly everyday and the hotel staff is always polite and lovely. The buffet restaurant for breakfast and dinner is amazing with a variety of choices. There are a few different specialty restaurants as well but the buffet was so impressive that most of our guests would rather eat there. The pool is clean and nice and quiet. The beach is unbelievable, all sand with see-through water. The beach is so great that everybody spent most time at the beach than at the swimming pools. We also spent a lot of time at the bar close to the reception and trust us: serving 30 over excited people at a time is not an easy task but the waiters and bar tenders did an amazing job everyday. Service is prompt and excellent and the cocktails are to die for. Now for the wedding part: We would like to extend our tremendous thanks to Edith and Cynthia, the wedding coordinators at the Riu Palace Mexico!! We were just so impressed. We contacted them about 3 months before the wedding and they were always very prompt in getting back to us with the required information. They were extremely patient given some of the questions we kept asking and always kept us informed. Once we arrived at the hotel, they sat down with us to finalize the details and tried to accommodate our needs to the best of their ability. They were both always so friendly and helpful reassuring us that they would take good care of us. The wedding was set to take place on the beach on a Thursday. Although it rained during our week stay in Mexico, it would always rain for about \u00bd hour and then the sun would be back but it seemed that on our wedding day, it had decided to pour the whole afternoon and evening. We were so nervous as things were not going as planned! But again Edith and Cynthia impressed us with their professionalism and organizations skills. They managed and directed our 56 guests to the hotel chapel and made our day a very special one. Most of our guests have traveled extensively around the world and they all agreed that this hotel was amazing and that the service was excellent. They all had a fantastic time and would return there if given the opportunity. As for us, we would definitely like to go back. The week went by too fast! Our wedding was everything we had imagined in a dream setting. We are so impressed with the wedding services of the hotel and are grateful to Edith and Cynthia for all their support and hard work.

The food at the resort is very good , and the buffets are varied enough to satisfy most everyones tastes. Living in a very cosmopolitan area like Washington ,D.C. , we didn't eat at the theme restaurants , because we have very good Brazilian , French , Japanese , and Steak restaurants in our area.The rooms were spotlessly clean , with no odor of must at all , and we were on the 1st floor. The maid service was great , and twice we came back to find \"towel animals\" on our bed. The theme shows at thehotel are very funny and entertaining. The piano bar features a pianist named David Carilla who is excellent , and he plays from 6P.M. til 9P.M. The Disco at the RIU Tequila across the street is lively and opens at 11 P.M. One of the strengths of the resort is it's staff. It is hard to single just a few out , but we'll try. Bartenders Moy and Jesus and Armando at the swim-up bar , Head doorman Manuel (a legend!!) ,Bar waitress Lupita at the piano bar, and Bartender Miriam at the piano bar , and front desk Manager Jose are just some of the excellent staff. We met a lot of nice folks of all age ranges , and from all over the world also. There are not a lot of children at this resort , though the few that we saw there seemed to be having a great time.

We went to the Royal Hideaway for the final 6 nights. Check In \u2013 We arrived and were quickly processed and given our room key. We did not have to wait for our room to be ready. Check in took us 10 minutes. We booked through the Riu Call Center (not a travel group \u2013 which seemed to take quite a bit longer to get their customers checked in). Room \u2013 We were in room 2009. It was centrally located and on the top floor. We overlooked the Riu next door (aka \u2013 not much of a view) but our room was quiet. The room was large but could use an upgrade. Our shower did have some mold and the room just needed a face lift. (I heard that the Riu Palace Riviera Maya has more modern rooms as it is a newer hotel). Housekeeping \u2013 Excellent. Our rooms were always put together. They decorated the room with heart balloons for our honeymoon and every day we got a little gift (ceramic bud vase, print of the Mayan Rivera). They put heart balloons all over our room the second day to help us celebrate. Resort \u2013 Everything you read below is correct \u2013 the resort is in perfect condition. Very clean and well kept\u2026it is quite beautiful. Pool \u2013 We are pool people, and we had some ups and downs about the pool. It is small (especially after we saw the new Riu Palace Riviera Maya\u2019s pool) but there are always pool chairs available at any time (this is huge as we had to get up at 5am to reserve pool chairs at the Royal Hideaway). Servers would come around every 10 minutes for drink requests. Beach \u2013 No doubt, this resort has the best beach in the entire area. It is huge, with tons of shade and there are shady areas if you move back from the water a bit. There is no comparison between this beach and any other \u2013 this is simply the best beach on the coast. Food \u2013 For an all inclusive, the food was good. On par with food we have had on cruises and much better than the food we had at other AI\u2019s. The buffets were all wonderful and they were so big, that there is something for everyone. Breakfast was especially great, but the coffee was not good at all. We ate at the Japanese Restaurant, the Steakhouse and the Gourmet Restaurants. The sushi at the Japanese was so-so, but we are from California and have excellent, fresh sushi, so we have high expectations. Guests \u2013 Although there were a few honeymooners and couples, there was an equal number of groups (graduation group, wedding group, etc) at the resort. There were only a few children and it was a mellow crew. When we went to the Riu Palace Riviera Maya we immediately notice that the group was much more lively and rowdy. A bit more Cancun-ish. The Riu Tequila had a TON of children \u2013 it is much more family oriented. We were happy with our decision to stay at the more mellow resort. Activities \u2013 Honestly, they were pretty lame (except for water aerobics which always had a big group of people having fun). For example, Pool Bingo was this strange version of bingo and if you won you had to get up and do an embarrassing cheer. However, when you have a beautiful resort at your disposal, you don\u2019t need activities. Spa \u2013 We had the 80min massage and it was good. Not one of the best treatments I have had, but I left satisfied and feeling great. The spa facility is tiny and not a place you would go before or after for relaxation but the massage itself was great. Entertainment \u2013 They had a nightly show and we never stayed longer than an hour. They were pretty cheesy \u2013 but the dancers work very hard putting on a great show. I think it would be better if they had a show every other night and then did more live bands on the off nights. Usually, the live band plays for a bit and then stops way too early for the show. My husband LOVED the cigar bar at the Riu. The owner is quite helpful and hand rolls the cigars himself in front of you. If we could do it over again, we would have stayed at the Royal Hideaway all 10 nights - there is no comparison between the two (and it is quite unfair to compare them) \u2013 but this was a great, cost-effective alternative. We will probably return to the Riviera Maya but most likely to the RH, however we have already recommended this resort for friends looking for a good AI.

I. Aeromexico Incompetent, slow, inattentive and rude attendants, AC was bad. Try to fly Continental or really any other airline that will get you to CUN. II. Check in at RIU Palace Mexico Picture perfect. We had an early flight, got to the hotel at 11 AM, were given our wristbands and checked right in. While this was definitely a function of their capacity more than anything, it was certainly welcome and saved basically an entire day of wandering around in town while we waited to check in. III. Room at RIU Kind of a drag to not have an ocean view. I'm told that only 6 rooms or so do. Still, very clean and comfortable, although a little hot for my tastes (temp was probably around 80 F in the room). Only two English speaking channels on the little TV (CNN and local ABC out of NY). Bathroom roomy and shower great. Had a bodet. Nice minibar with everything you would would want in it for what you paid. Corona is the hotel beer. IV. Beach at RIU The best looking water in the world. Not much shade as Hurricane Wilma stripped many leaves off the palm trees. No palapas or other rentable shade. We saw innovative people cramming umbrellas into the beach chairs and decided to buy some in town (\"dos sombrinos\" -- $20 total). The sombrinos wound up being a little flimsy and were constantly turned inside out by the wind. More innovative and economical were the beachgoers who inverted beach loungers (free and ubiquitous) and placed them on top of the loungers they were sitting in. That method really did provide some MUCH NEEDED relief from the very powerful sun. Otherwise, there were many cigarette butts on the beach. V. Drink service on beach Basically nonexistent. I was there for a week and wasn't offered a single drink. Anticipating this, I brought along a shoulder cooler which I filled with the drinks from my mini bar. This was a great plan, except that NONE (AS IN NOT ON ONE SINGLE FLOOR) of the hallway ice machines worked. Thus, I had to fill my cooler, walk to one the of bars for ice, and then make the LONG walk to the beach (with my sombrino). This is a good place to mention this: THERE IS A TON A WALKING WHEN YOU STAY AT THIS PLACE. Oh yes, BRING ONE OR TWO OF THE HUGE BOTTLES OF WATER IN YOUR ROOM WITH YOU. VI. Pool and all its actvities The pool looked nice, but the W and I are are total beach people; we didn't enter the pool once. It appeared that they had lots of organized activities during the day (spanish lessons, volleyball, riflery [presumably off campus for that]). Again, we stayed away from the pool, so if that part is important to you, you might want to check other reviews. V. Food Breakfast I love breakfast, and this was some of the best I've had. Great selection in the buffet. Fantastice fresh fruits. Lunch Pretty good. It always seemed like a little bit of a pain to hike back to the hotel and eat once we finally got situated on the beach. Still, service was good and food was above average. We usually ate at La Traviatta, closet the the beach (and oh so hot during the afternoon). Dinner MEN MUST WEAR LONG PANTS TO BE ADMITTED TO ANY OF THE DINNERS. Also, if you shun the buffet in favor of one the the four \"theme restaurants,\" you better get up at the crack of dawn to make your reservations. Unless you're just dying to be served what amounts to buffet food in a ala carte setting, I recommend having dinner at of the the two buffets. There is a huge selection of good, though not great, food, and you don't have to sit around all night while some waiter turns truly basic food into a 5-7 course meal. VI. Entertainment at night at the hotel Inside A great piano player near the main bar around dinner time. Also an internet cafe that operates near the bar at dinner time for $3 / 15 minutes. Can't tell you how many times I forked over that three bucks while my wife blew dry every strand of hair on her head in the room. Outside Very, very cheesy. \"Grease\" productions and the like that made me wanted to blow my head off. My advice: get a double from the bar and just go down to the beach, which should be cool and quiet at that point. VII Miscellaneous A. Snorkeling from the beach Forget it. While the water is calmer than Cancun, it's still not calm enough to do any decent snorkeling. Go to Cozumel, or -- if you have a sea sick wife like mine, go to XEL - HA where you can snorkel without getting on a boat.. We went to XEL HA, and it was the best money I've spent in years -- so natural, clean, such magical snorkeling. B. Fishing from the beach. Forget it. Don't lug your rod around like I did, not unless you're planning on going to Puerto Juarez or some place where you can fish in the surf. P.S. Great surf fishing from the RIU Caribe in Cancun (don't tell anybody!). C. The screwing of the exchange rate If you are coming from America, take the cash you plan to spend, go to town and convert itr into pesos ON YOUR FIRST NIGHT. The Mexicans ignore the exchange rate and always divide by 10 when changing you, even though the rate is closer to 11. On big purchases and dinner bills, this can definitely make a huge difference, and they know it. D. Best restaurant in Playa La Parilla -- hands down. Fairly priced, good food at a streetside table on avenida quintanida, won't screw you on the exchange rate.", "Date": "June 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "missouri", "Title": "\u201cRIU Palace Mexico--The place to go!!\u201d", "Author": "thewayitis", "ReviewID": "UR5294165", "Content": "My wife and I just returned today June 2nd, from the Riu Palace-Mexico. This was our second time and we still love it. The resort is 100 percent recovered from the hurricane last year and the palm trees are full of leaves. Best of all the beach is beautiful--literally it is the best beach in the Riviera Maya-Playa del Carmen vicinity. We walked to other beaches such as the Royal Hideaway which is a lot more expensive, and the Riu Palace Mexico is much better. Also if you are debating on whether to stay at the Riu Palace-Mexico, Riu-Yucatan, Riu-Tequila, or the newest Riu-Riviera Maya, our advice would be to stay at the Riu Palace-Mexico. The New Riu-Riviera Maya is beautiful, but they don't have their stuff together like the staff at the Riu-Mexico, and the beach is not even comparable to the Riu-Mexico. When you stay at the Riu-Mexico you have access to all the other Riu's that I mentioned and they are all in walking distance. It is fun to go to the Riu-Tequila in the evening for drinks, but if you choose to stay at the Mexico for the evening, they will treat you like royalty. The best restaurants to dine in at the Riu Palace Mexico is Sir Edward--trust me, the duck and red snapper were my favorite dishes there. The next best is Miyagi, a japanese bistro. I am picky about my sushi and Miyagi surprised me....it was excellent!! Your room at the RiuPalace-Mexico is stocked with corona, water bottles, orange soda, 7-up, pepsi, and diet pepsi. The bar in your room is stocked with Jose Cuervo tequila, Bacardi Rum, Smirnoff Vodka, and Presidents Brandy. The rooms are spotless and cleaned daily. You can get all kinds of drinks made to order at the othe 4 bars like daquari's martini's what ever you can think of. Bring your own Margarita mix for your room. Also be sure to bring plenty of sunscreen because if you buy it there you will pay. I ran out and it cost me 25.00 for a bottle, and I looked all over for the best price. Just to let you know do not worry about what the weather forcast says. We thought it was going to rain everyday the whole week we were there based on what weather.com was forcasting. We never saw a drop and the sun was out all week. Bring some soft toilet paper. Go jet skiing--55 dollars for a half hour but worth it. I'd say 30 percent of the women lay out topless at the beach. The water is unbeleivable and really is as blue as you see in the pictures.

There was one day during our stay that it rained and was overcast and we wanted to jump in the hot tub and were slightly dissapointed. But had it not been raining we wouldn't have even known there was a hot tub as we wanted to spend every minute at the beach. Here is a helpful tip: learn some speanish! We learned just the most petty basic phrases and it made a huge difference! We need to remember that we are visitors in their country.

The cabs are very accessible and cheap. Back to the hotel. We had zero mold and were on the middle level. Our room was cleaned very well. We tipped $15 on the first day and got plenty of towel animals. At first I was afraid to leave my luggage unlocked in the room but I got over that by day 2. The beds were not too hard for us and we didn't mind the 2 beds pushed together either. The food is pretty good. By day 7 it all tastes the same though. Breakfast is the best meal of the day and we all loved the italian restaurant down by the beach for lunch. We ate at the steakhouse (pretty good) and the brazilian (pretty great). We didn't get up early enough to ever get into the other 2 restaurants. We got massages on the beach and they were WONDERFUL! We did see about 7-10 topless women on the beach for those of you who care about that. It didn't bother us at all. We went dancing at the Blue Parrott in downtown Playa and had a blast. Well worth it. The nightly entertainment at the hotel is great! Our favorite was the \"Miss Riu Palace Contest\" it was hilarious. The entertainment is just that: entertaining and mostly hilarious.

The service was impeccable and our every request (we never heard the word no) was taken care of promptly and courteously. The food was excellent and we thought the drinks were good, too. In fact, whenever we thought the drinks weren't strong enough, we simply asked for more alcohol and received more every time. We hit the beach every day and never had a problem finding a shady spot. We usually got there around 11am so it wasn't like we had to get up at 6am to find shade. And as others have said, this is the best beach you will ever see. Clear blue water, lots of sand, plenty of space. Simply perfect. Here are some tips to consider- they worked great for us: 1) If you feel the mattresses are too hard, request a mattress pad. We did and slept better b/c of it. 2) Bring an insulated mug. We brought 24oz mugs and they worked perfect. The bartenders will fill them without saying a word. 3) We ate at 2 of the restaurants (Brazilian and Steakhouse). Food was good, atmosphere was nice. And both times we made our reservations at 10am. So no need to get up early and wait in line. Maybe we got lucky but I doubt luck struck twice. 4) Get a room on either the 1st or 2nd floor. Our initial room was on the bottom (room 83) and it was very musty. We requested a change and got a 2nd floor room (2112) and it was 100x better. No smell, cooler temps, better views.

We definitely made a great choice. Here are some great points about the hotel: 1. Hotel - it was absolutely beautiful. The decor, lobby, beach, and pool were spetacular. The beach was the best in the area and that is why I go to Cancun area (Caribbean). The beach was spacious unlike some of the other hotels in the area. I walked the beach and it looked like some of the resorts' beaches, people were laying right next to each other. The palm trees' leaves are growing back, so the shade is increasing. The only thing about the hotel and beach in general is if you have trouble walking, it is sort of a hike to go to the beach as well as walking around the hotel. 2. Location - it is very convenient to go to Playa del Carmen - a 5 minute, $5.00 cab ride. In the town, you can catch a Ferry to Cozumel which my family and I did and it was well worth it. 3. Food - I must have put on a few pounds because the food was delicious. Those individuals who didn't like the food at this resort must be picky eaters. If you cannot find anything at this resort that you like to eat, it is your fault. There is a buffet daily as well as the specialty restaurants. The Japanese restaurant was my favorite because of the food selection and being different (I have never tried sushi). We found out from the hotel manager that one of the nights at the buffet is chef's night and they cook elaborate food. For example, there are animal carvings on the salad bars made out of melons as well as ice sculptures. In addition, I really enjoyed waking up in the morning to freshly blended juices such as mango, banana, watermelon and etc. 4. Service - the service was excellent. The staff at the hotel were always trying to please as well as no sooner you finished a drink, you had another one in your hand. Hey, if they aren't as strong as you might like your drinks, just drink more! All of the staff were very friendly and personable. This is my only somewhat negative point about the hotel. The Front Desk staff needs improvement in regards to customer service. They really didn'y understand English too well and it took me 15 minutes to check into my room and I was the only person at the counter. In addition, I wished that the hotel had a concierge that could provide local tourist information. For example, we had to ask a few individuals about the night club hours in Playa del Carmen. We went to Senior Frogs one night and it was totally dead. The next night, we went to the Blue Parrot and it was much busier and a nicer club too. This is information that the Front Desk should know, but didn't. One last feature that I liked in the hotel was the stocked mini-refrigerator. There is alcohol and nonalcoholic beverages stocked. It was definitely a convenience to take a large cold bottle of water to the beach every day. This refrigerator was replenished on a daily basis. 5. Entertainment - the entertainment was really enjoyable at the hotel. The dancers were great. Also, you can rent free of charge on the beach - boogie boards, canoes and etc. Jetskis and fishing charters are available for a fee. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel. The area called Playacar is a gaited community, so you are totally safe to walk around the area. I did tour a few of the other hotels in the Riu chain, but I feel that this hotel was the best. However, the pool was the best at the Riu Palace Mayan Riviera. Although, the beach was better at the Palace Mexico. Comparing Cancun to Playa del Carmen, it all depends upon your taste. If you like to party, then go to Cancun. However, if you would like to relax, but have some fun during the day and go to a more relaxed night club, then Playa del Carmen is your choice.

We really enjoyed our stay and were impressed by the cleanliness of the resort. The staff was professional and friendly and staff management checked daily, sometimes twice to see if your stay was going good. ROOMS: Very clean. Beds and pillows very firm. Mini bar stocked daily. We had a room facing courtyard fountains, nice views. FOOD: Very good. Variety and service at the buffet was great. Although the service at the two restaurants was great, we were not as impressed with the food (but it was good as well). DRINKS: Seemed to be a little watered down at the beach and pool areas. But in the outdoor courtyard bar and the bar Cubanos off the lobby, the drinks and service was great. POOL: Pool area was nice. Never had any problems getting chairs or umbrellas. We thought the pool at the RIU Palace Riviera Maya was incredilbe if you are more into the pool area than the beach. But we are mostly beach fans. BEACH: This was the best beach in the whole area. Color of the water was awesome. We normally like more secluded beaches, but the beach area was large enough that you could find your own private palm tree. The only draw back and I still can't understand how people can disturb a piece of paradise like this, but there were cigarette butts everywhere. I guess you will have those people everywhere. Not sure if the resort could attend to this more. Overall we had a wonderful stay. The friendliness of the staff was awesome and we were impressed by how hard the staff worked to maintain the place. These people I'm sure worked long shifts because we saw many of the staff morning, noon and night.

The beach in front of the Palace is the best beach in Riviera Maya. The sand is white and soft and the water is the bluest I've ever seen, and crystal clear. We had a large number of friends with us and we did not have any problem getting lounge chairs together. You do not have to get up extra early to reserve a chair. We spent most of our day on the beach and then moved to the pool around 3:00 for happy hour. The pool is a little on the small side, or should I say the swim up bar side is a little small. We had at least 30 people with us at happy hour and I must say that the size of the pool did not spoil our fun! The bar tenders at the pool bar were great! They never slowed down and the drinks were great. Corona is the beer you will find at the Palace. I thought the Margaritas were very good too. For breakfast, Lunch and Dinner we spent most of our time at the buffet. My family and I thought that the buffet was very good. There were many different items to choose from. For breakfast there was everything you could think of, pancakes, french toast, omlets, cereal, fruit. pastry, etc. For lunch there were so many things to have from burgers, pizza, nachos, salads. and the list goes on! The dinner buffet was usually a different theme each night. Mexican, Italian, Chef's Gala. There were always carving stations, pasta stations, tuns of breads and pastries. A chocolate fountain. The wine red and white, espcially white was very good. The Champagin was the best. The staff did everything to accomadate our large party. At our request they would have a table set up ahead of time for as many as we wanted. I can't say enough good things about Maria, Karima, and Tamara.( These 3 girls work so hard to make everyone happy) We saw so much of them. They were always available for anything we needed. We did eat at the Barzilian rest. one night, but didn't think it was good. With 2 young kids it didn't make since to eat in a resturant at a certain time, especially when there really isn't anything on the menu for children, and they loved the buffet. By the way... you do need long pants for dinner... no matter what others say! The property at the Palace is spotless and beautiful. The staff works so hard and late at night and in the early morning to make sure of it. Checking in at the front desk was painless. Barbara was very friendly. We did have to wait for our rooms, but it was worth the wait, and the Hotel was very full during this week. The rooms in the hotel were a nice size and very nice and clean. We are a family of 4 with 2 kids so we had plenty of room. My kids took turns sleeping on the sofa. By the way I did not see any mold in any form or fashion. And the first thing I did was inspect the sofa. Everything was spotless. I did speak to management about this issue and they explained that after the hurricane, they only had a room capacity of about 100. Many of the rooms remained closed for at least a month, and with the humidity it's almost impossible to avoid the musty smell. Everything has been cleaned, painted, and replaced. At night there are shows for the kids, then adults. I never really watched the shows for the adults, but heard from friends that the Michael Jackson show was the best. There was always music in the courtyard. If you wanted more action, Playa was only a 5min. cab ride, and there was a club across the street at the other hotel. Shopping in town was good. I did not miss the big city of Cancun. There is also shopping across the street is nice to have so close. Shopping on the beach is even better!! I would definately recomend staying at the Riu Palace Mexico for your next vacation you will have a great time. When you look around the palace and see what you see, I don't know how anyone could complain about this resort. Have a great vacation.", "Date": "May 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cNot what i expected At All\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5020740", "Content": "OK the airport was horrible. We were taken by bus to the main airport from our plane. We were shoved on a bus like sardines. We then were taken to customs where we waited online for an hour because the women in charge of our line kept walking away and coming back. We took so long at customs that when we got to the luggage carousel our stuff was already thrown to the side. The security agents were very rude and nasty and were to busy talking then to pay attention to whats going on. We then went outside to wait for Olympus tours to take us to our hotel long wait but the people were very nice from Olympus. Took about an hour and 15 mins to get to our hotel between a little traffic and all the stops at the other hotels to drop people off. We finally got to our hotel and the front desk girl was very nice but she talked to us like we were stupid and took forever to complete check in. There were also no keys for the safe's and we had to come the next morning to get one. They didnt have a key for every safe in the hotel so i had to carry my airline tickets and birth certificate everywhere because I was scared to leave it in the room. Pool: SO SMALL! nice design but way too small. And as for Dirty by like 5:00 yea it had some sand on it but after people were on the beach they would jump in the pool and sand at the bottom of the pool is just expected. And everynight the pool was vaccummed and cleaned. Beach: the beach was great. it was clean and the waves were a lot of fun. No topless women unless they were over 40+ and they were european. Food: I only like breakfast at the buffet. My boyfriend liked everything. Ate at the Brazilian Restaurant \"La Bodega\" one nite it was HORRIBLEEEEEE my table and a few other tables actually got up an walked out. I pretty much survived on the french fries and salad for 6 days. We went shopping at a market place right by the hotel What a rip off in prices compared to the 5th ave shopping down town (a $5.00 cab ride) I picked up a few souveniors and I felt taken advantage of with the translations from us dollars to peso's. Cabs were very easy to get and usually only cost $5.00. We went to Dolphin Encounters which was a lot of fun. We also went to Xel-ha which is a natural aquarium. Basically it was a lagoon with fish and they give u a snorkel and u pay like $45 a person to go . Absolutely not worth it . THere were huge rocks where u can easily cut ur leg and the water was cloudy. and everything was really long walks or u can use one of their crummy bikes to get around because the man in charge of the train ride was sleeping. I was really unhappy with my whole trip the hotel was very outdated, spotless but old looking and gloomy no mexican bright colors or anything like that. The service was superior however to any other hotel i have ever been to. Everyone is so friendly and goes out of their way to help you. The second they saw your drink was almost empty they came through with a new one. The nights were very boring especially for two people in their 20's. The bars were boring and dark and most of the shows were cheesie. I think after this experience in Mexico I will definetely not return to Mexico at all.

We love the beach and swimming in the sea, and the beach at the Riu Palace Mexico is the best I've been to. Better than Aruba, better than Punta Cana, and better than other places I've stayed on the Mayan Riveria. You can see your toes in shoulder deep water clearly. The waves were just enough to do some light body surfing, but not enough to beat you up. For my taste, nearly the perfect beach. The food was awesome. I bet I gained 10 pounds while I was there. Usually I avoid the buffets at AI resorts, but if you avoid the buffets here, you would be missing out big time. I've stayed at places where the \"gourmet\" restaurants weren't nearly as good as the food on the buffet at the RIU Palace Mexico. We did eat at a couple of the specialty restaurants, Sir Edwards and the Japanese place, and while they were both excellent, the buffet was just as good. Also, by eating at the buffet, you eat when you want to instead of committing to a time, and you don't have to go through the hassle of making reservations. Like what you expect from a resort in Mexico, the service was outstanding. I loved this place, and I plan to go back. However, there are a couple of areas that could be improved upon: The beds. I had read that the beds were very firm, but that did not prepare me for just how firm they were. I would say a better word would be hard. Beach bar. Because the beach is so wide, if you like having you lounger right up by the water, it's a bit of a hike to the beach bar. I saw other people take large mugs. One guy had a mug the size of a pitcher, and the bartenders would gladly fill it up. I recommend you take something like that. The pool was only average, but I never understood why people even use the pool area at resorts that have such an awesome beach. So if you're a pool person, maybe this isn't the resort for you. However, if you like a spectacular beach, great food, gorgeous views everywhere you look, and being treated like royalty, then you would have a hard time finding a better place to vacation.", "Date": "April 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "white Plains, NY", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing Vacation\u201d", "Author": "ny1478", "ReviewID": "UR5009327", "Content": "My family and I visited Riu Palace Mexico over the Easter holiday weekend. The weather was fantastic and the ocean water was glorious. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at the Riu Palace with only a few minor complaints! Rooms: We had three courtyard view groundfloor rooms. Beautiful, clean and no mold to speak of whatsoever! Food: Fantastic. The pancakes at the breakfast buffet were my personal favorite. Skip the Brazilian resturant, but try the French. The meat at the Brazilian resturant was NOT good. Beach: Amazing crystal clear blue water with plenty of waves. One sour note however, the Riu Palace has something against beach umbrellas and palapas. You CANNOT sit on the beach if you need shade. The plam trees DO NOT provide any protection against the brutal Yucatan sun. Make sure to bring your floppy beach hat and SPF 55!!! Pool/Pool Bar: Very boring small pool for such a beautiful resort. It really needs a makeover and the bar could use a livlier soundtrack. Try the Yucatan's pool for a party atmosphere. That said try the Miami Vice...what a great drink. You also must reserve chairs by 8:30ish to get a good spot. Grounds: Immaculate, you could literally eat off the ground. Service: Terrific. Everyone was friendly and service oriented. Entertainment: Boring and cheesy. The bands were good, but seemed to enjoy playing tacky wedding music! One other note, we visited the Riu Palace Riviera Maya. While they do have a much nicer pool, the Riu Palace Mexico is by far the nicer resort. The new palace looks as if it was mass-manufactured.

We took a Sunquest charter tour Easter Week 4/15 - 4/22: Airport: to our pleasant surprise, we were bussed to the opposite side of Cancun airport, and waited in line for just 15 minutes to push the button. They have new customs area and it moved quickly, and this was day before Easter. Luggage did not move quite as fast. Arrived at 9:20 am, - made it to Playacar by 11:30 am. Check-in: we were disappointed to be taken to the piano bar area and found there were no rooms until after 3:00. There was no front desk welcome, no package with our name waiting for us. First time ever in all our travels we checked in like this \u2013 and told to come back later. We walked around in our jeans until 3:30 \u2013 with a small baby this was not ideal. Take your bathing suits or shorts in your carry-on, we saw this happened every day all week long, if you came in with a tour like Apple, Sunquest, etc. The regular room reservations, no tours \u2013 got a room immediately upon check-in. Lobby: Yes its ornate, but we were disappointed with the dark dreary nature of the wood, the mint green walls in the dark piano/lobby bar were all depressing, and we knew right away no one would congregate here in the evenings because its \u201cupstairs\u201d from the main eating levels. This was our important first impression and we were a little disheartened after being greeted at the front door of the Katenah Palladium last year and handed a welcome package and personal greeting to the whole tour. The RIU Palace d\u00e9cor feeling is not Mexico like Iberostars and Palladiums, its more rather depressing 1800\u2019s New Orleans Creole fancy with red velvet circular banquettes we haven't seen since the PeeWee Herman show was cancelled. The chandeliers were beautiful - but again maybe in Rome, not Mexico. And we absolutely hated the very mid-evil feel to the buffet dinner eating quarters. These awful 4 foot flame lantern lights attached to the columns made it look like the days of Shakespere and MacBeth. Grounds: were beautiful. The landscaping is gorgeous and well maintained. The fountains are gorgeous in the courtyard. Breathtaking. One note too here - there are two elevators from the lobby to the upper rooms (3 floors here) - and to the lower level for pool / eating. But once you got to your floor - you walked through dark narrow hallways to get to your room. It's not open and a jungle atmosphere like at Iberostars or Palladiums or even RIU Tequila. This wore on mommy as she had to walk these hallways with baby for naps several times a day. Rooms: we pre-emailed and asked for a rollaway bed and a room on 2nd floor overlooking fountains. We got a courtyard fountain room on the 3rd floor (2060's) and no rollaway bed. Son #1 had to sleep on the small couch first night. Not good. The beds were very hard. Two doubles pushed together. Room was spacious, bright \u2013 NO ODOR \u2013 no mold. Balcony was iron gate and we could sit and see the stage bandstand (this would be trouble later), the wedding processionals, the fountains and see the action. Room had iron/board, extra blankets and pillows, hair dryer, old fashioned metal lock/key safe, mini bar closet with 4 bottles of liquor in dispense mode, beer, pepsi in plastic, 7-up, orange drink and selzer water and plenty of bottled water in two sizes. Mini bar was filled 2 additional times over 7 days. No coffee maker. The bedding is somewhat dated and threadbare, and the curtains were very formal. Shower is a tub, with removable wand shower head (good for rinsing baby) and vinyl shower curtain. On 2nd day after 3 calls about a bed, we visited the front desk, pleaded for the 14 year old and got a bed by noon. They moved the coffee table and placed a solid wood double bed looking out the french doors. The rooms were brighter than Iberostars due to the colors and sunlight coming in all day. Air conditioning was adequate if french doors stayed closed. One single ceiling fan also. Pool: all we can say as a family... unanimously thumbs down! The pool is a circle cut in half. It\u2019s too small, dirty and the side where the pool bar is \u2013 is really questionable in terms of cleanliness. We saw things floating in the corners, muck on the surface. No floatees. Small pool volleyball area. Big big letdown if you are used to the Iberostar free form pools \u2013 or Palladium. Mom went in all of 2 times all week. So disappointing. We suppose for the smaller crowd this hotel gets \u2013 its adequate at best. One girl server at the pool all day killed herself to get drinks all week long \u2013 we tipped her daily. The one bathroom too by the pool in the pool bar area smelled so bad everyday (a chemical like smell) I gagged every time I went in, gagged like I was going to be sick) I refused to use it and would walk to the lunch area entrance. Not sure what the chemical smell was but it was bad. Popcorn machine and nachos by pool bar daily. There is no music, games, activities, exercise - nothing at the pools - not even plesant background music. Just white noise. Beach: unbelievable. Best beach we have ever been at. No rocks, plenty of room. Awesome waves. Plenty of beach access, chairs, and even a drink guy coming by. He carried the mixers and actual bottles of liquor and mixed right there on beach. The views are lovely, and there are miles to walk in each direction. However - there is no difference in the beach at RIU Palace, RIU Yukatan or Iberostar Tucan - they are all right next to each other and run into each other. The only difference is the chair color, and the nice palapas at Iberostar Tucan/Quezel. Jockey for chairs/shade: yes they do it here too; however not as early. We found great chair selection at 9:00 am each day. We would put our towels down, and walk the beach. By 11:30 the pool chairs were filled. You could not find 2 together. Here\u2019s one big problem we noticed: NO Palapas anywhere. If you need shade at some point \u2013 the only coverage is ivory canvas beach umbrellas. There is no escape from the sun at RIU Palace MX. The beach umbrellas are ok \u2013 but have to be moved around in big heavy weight peds \u2013 there are no grass palapas anywhere on this property whatsoever. We needed that for the baby. The beach umbrellas give this place a very European feel or better the Beverly Hills Beach and Tennis Club - not the beautiful palapas of Mexico. We walked over to the Iberostar Tucan and saw the difference in shade around the pool \u2013 it was almost dark compared to RIU Palace. They have the cushioned bed palapas too, and coverage on the beach as well. We've stayed there and their pool, grotto and waterfalls beat RIU hands down. So Iberostar Tucan/Quezel wins here for shade / and pool size. And it was the Canadian and American moms at RIU Palace who were making scenes over chairs, missing goggles, \u201cyou stole our towels\u201d etc. Not the Europeans, who were very relaxed and pleasant. Lunch: served in the pool area El Patio and La Traviata (I think) \u2013 one side hamburgers and fajitas daily, the other side was flat pizza and Italian pasta, soup, etc. Salad bars on both sides. The hamburgers were excellent. The pizza very good. Soft ice cream machines here daily. Salad bars on both sides with iceberg lettuce and romaine lettuce daily. We ate veg\u2019s daily and no issues with stomachs. Husband ate the grilled fish everyday in taco shells and said it was excellent. Fried chicken legs one day were very tasty too. Guacamole was outstanding every day. Dinner: we did buffet first night. Excellent. We cannot say enough about the food and selection. It slightly beats Iberostar\u2019s and does circles around Palladium and Bahia. The slow roasted meats each night are excellent (ham, duck, roast beef) the pasta station and sauces were very good \u2013 best Alfredo sauce I\u2019ve had on vacation. And love that Guacamole. Stuffed dungeonese crabs one night. Each night is themed (Italian, Mexican, etc.). Asia Pacific night was superb with stir-fry, sushi that was excellent, smoked salmon, soy sauces, duck, etc. We could never get coffee with dinner ever. Red wine they poured at dinner was just so/so. Some of the wait staff did not take kindly to the mess the baby would make, especially chocolate ice cream on the napkins. So we found one waiter who was great to us and sat in his section nightly. And desserts were tasteless cakes and cookies and pies - no taste at all. Steakhouse: unlike Iberostar and Palladiums, you make one reservation per day for that night in line in the theatre area. You must stand in line daily from 9-9:30 and pick from 4 (maybe 5) restaurants \u2013 Brazil, Mexican, Italian, Steakhouse, and maybe Med \u2013 I can\u2019t remember. We waited in line one day just 10 minutes, picked the steakhouse (from 2 sitting times) \u2013 which was the lunch area dressed up by beach. Salad is a la carte, and the ribeye steaks were really bad. My husband selected the tuna, and he was served swordfish. It took forever, service was slow, each table\u2019s meal was prepared together, one group at a time. Not worth it \u2013 the buffet was so much better. We skipped eating at restaurants after this night. We heard the Brazilian was outstanding with several meats on skewers served at your table. Breakfast: usual faire. The handmade donuts are to die for. Thumbs up on having make-your-own mimosas daily. And BEST part of breakfast: they would come and serve you your first cup of coffee, and leave the whole pot. You never had to wait for coffee again for breakfast. Just drank and poured, drank and poured. Loved that!!!! Entertainment: was our biggest issue. We heard on all the boards this place was quiet \u201cdead, stuffy\u201d etc. Well it's not. There is a house band that starts playing at 8:00 on the bandstand in the courtyard right outside the rooms, and dinner / theatre area. They stop at 8:30 pm for \u201cmini disco\u201d when all the kids go up on stage and dance in the theatre. (Other than this mini disco I saw no activities for the kids outside of a few sports contests). We knew there was no kids club here. Then the band would start playing again at 9:00 pm until 9:45 when the theatre nightly show would start. The theatre is nice seating \u2013 soft pink velour seats. After the theatre show ends at 10:30 pm \u2013 the band would resume and play outside until 11:15 or 11:30 pm every night. So two problems: if you have kids \u2013 9:45 pm is way too late to wait for a show, and if you have kids, and a courtyard room, the music blasts you out of bed until 11:30. My husband was irate every night \u2013 he could not fall asleep listening to bad renditions of \u201cfeelings\u201d and \u201cSweet home Alabama\u201d sung by really bad Mexican singers. We didn\u2019t complain officially, however learned on the plane that other couples with small children did complain. Room location didn\u2019t matter, if you faced the courtyard, you got the music. And similar schedule was in place at RIU Tequila across the street too. Loud music until 11:30 pm every night. Bars: really really disappointing in all directions. The pool bar was a busy place everyday with great service; however as in all RIUs they skimp on the alcohol. They cannot make a margarita to save their lives, tried 3 times and each tasted terrible. The Palladium Ketenah and Iberostar Paraiso made them sensationally - frozen and regular. The strawberry drinks at RIU were bad too. So we stuck to weak Pina Coladas and banana dac\u2019s since they could not harm these too much. Beer was also always somewhat flat, not really crisp or cold. It\u2019s Corona on tap at most of the bars. Although they did have something in a bottle - you must have to ask because we were never offered bottled beer. The little bar/hut on the beach was just an outlet for water for us. One server was very rude to the Mommy when she asked for Pinapple juice for the baby - he said \"you didn't even say good morning\". Not acceptable; and the only sign of bad service all week. They closed that up everyday at 5. The pool bar was closed by 6. The bar in the courtyard was never used. So we got the feeling they wanted everyone up away from the pools everyday and shut the bars to do it. The little bar in the back of theatre area didn\u2019t open until 7 or so. So at 6:00 when most hotels have a big central lobby bar meeting place and music \u2013 this had none. You had to go upstairs to the 2nd floor lobby area, to sit in the depressing moldy smelling mint green julep piano lobby bar \u2013 where the piano bar music was so depressing. Get the picture. We noticed the seniors like to hang here nightly. That\u2019s about it. The servers do work very hard. Overall: the place is very compact and feels intimate. However, there just was not enough in the way of entertaining bars, shade from the sun, beautiful pools, decent music, and quiet evenings to make us want to come back. We had a wonderful time, thought overall the complex was very pretty on the outside, but it just was not our cup of tea. It has a turn of the century European nature/feel to it \u2013 much more intimate than the rowdy family crowds at Iberostar. We liked the smaller feel only for no lines for food, etc. We missed walks around a large complex like Palladium, through the jungle plants and seeing all sorts of wildlife like pink flamingos at Palladium and tree monkeys at Iberostar. There was none at RIU to show our baby. We met lovely German couples, one who waved and blew kisses to our son every day. There were people from Germany, Czech Republic, France, Scandanavia, Canada and Latin America as well. Only a few times did a family of Latin Americans walk right in front of us - cutting us off at dinner. And yes there is smoke at times - most notable at breakfast in close quarters. Comparison: we did go to the new RIU Palace Mexican Riviera down the street. It was exactly the same on the inside \u2013 same layout, same location of theatre, courtyard, restaurants - same Euro feel inside / stuffy bar feel. The pool was much nicer, but the beach was smaller. And some of the rooms that overlooked the street really had a lousy view because the hotel seems so much closer to the street. Across the street: we walked through the RIU Tequila also. The pool was much nicer (remember they have no beach) and the lobby bar was so much more like an Iberostar or Palladium. Lively bar, large lobby with soft seating, fun, families everywhere. We did hear they had the late night music also here. If it were not for being across the street and such a long walk to beach, we would consider RIU Tequila next time. We did not get to RIU Yucatan next door, but could see from the outside their pool was much nicer and family oriented also. Our recommendation: we spent more to go here and wished we would have spent less and stayed with the Iberostar chain. Tip: take bug spray, and wear no perfume. We were eaten alive the last night by mosquitoes we think. We have welts at home from multiple bites.

I agree with most of the previous reviewers, so I will try not be repetitive. The hotel and beach are really good and having checked the neighbouring hotels, the Riu Palace beach is undoubtedly the best and largest. I have to agree that there is a lack of shade problem and I do not know how long the palm trees will take to regrow again. We stayed in the Riu Palace Macao in Punta Cana once, has the same beach/palm trees layout and it was much more agreeable (and easy) to be in the shade there. In Riu Palace Mexico you have to constantly move your lounger around for shade, and you only can do that if the beach is not full of people. In the Easter week-end it was... Riviera Maya seemed a bit windy to us and the beach water temperature was 26\u00ba to 28\u00ba Celsius (afternoon) and I missed the 30\u00baC water from the Seychelles and NorthEast Brazil. My wife and children took the parasailing 10 min. tour and they liked it. The swimming pool was average and I do not like the concept of a swim-up bar. People tend to drink and become loud there... And it seems very easy to spill the drinks on the water, which did not look crystal clear... We had a room facing north, to the neighbouring Riu Playacar Hotel. In short, no views (see photo) but, at least, you will not hear the entertainment music coming from the center \"patio\" if you like to go to bed early (european jet-lag). Our room did not smell musty and it was on ground floor. We ate mainly in the buffet, which was good, and accepted the one time invitation to dine at the steak house, nice. We did not bother reserving \"a la carte\" restaurants. Service was friendly although in the beach restaurants (lunch) sometimes it seemed a bit understaffed, the hotel was full. The reception people were great and the Euro exchange rate seemed very acceptable at the hotel. There were daily newspapers available at the reception shop, El Pais from Spain or the Miami Herald from Cancun. There was broadband internet available at the lobby, costing 80 pesos for one hour or 30 pesos for 15 minutes. My wife loved the Playa del Carmen village (mainly shopping...). One afternoon we took a taxi to Xcaret (12 US$) and bought the \"after 3 pm\" ticket and the optional dinner for the night show. On the whole, it all seemed a bit too expensive (admissionand totalling around 210 euros for our family of four) but the entrance to the night show is really spectacular with all those Mayan characters dressed up very impressively (see photos). Overall I would very much recommend the Riu Palace Mexico hotel and beach, but, if you need beach shade, you should wait for the palm trees to recover from Wilma.", "Date": "April 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cPerfection\u201d", "Author": "SamgNewJersey", "ReviewID": "UR4989144", "Content": "I just returned from the Riu Palace from a week-long vacation with my wife and two children (princess age 9 and boy age 14). I travel extensively on business -- both domestic US and international -- but have never stayed at a Riu Property. I also take vacations too infrequently. In other words, a week at the Palace needed to be perfect. And it was, by all measurable standards. Other reviews have commented on the food (I can confirm that Don Julian's is an exceptional buffet), the gorgeous beachfront (white sand that feels almost powdery and never hot), etc. so let me offer a number of other observations: This resort is PERFECT for families. My two children had the time of their lives. They were always made to feel like royalty in all areas of the property (from the pool to the restaurants to the internet cafe in the lobby). I can emphatically state that this is a kid friendly resort -- conversely under no circumstances was anyone's enjoyment inhibited by the presence of children. As mentioned, PERFECT for families of all sizes and ages. The resort's facilities are spotless and kept in outstanding condition. I had a room on the first floor and it was a quick and easy walk to the beach and the pool. The room was spacious, clean, and without hyperbole, the best I have ever stayed at. We had two cots brought into the room and it fit the family of four very very comfortably. I was prewarned about the \"aroma\" of the tropics but there was no smell of moisture, humidity, etc. Believe me, my honker would have detected anything amiss. The business model of the Riu is clearly one that promotes customer loyalty and retention. That is evident from how the staff interacts with the guests. From the moment I stepped out of the taxi and Manuel at the entrance greeted me to \"his palace,\" I got the sense that all employees feel like they have a stake in the success of the resort. Manuel learned our names quickly and never stopped greeting us like we were long lost friends. Sylvia made sure that my princess and son knew how to use the computers. A special word of commendation goes to the client-facing staff of the Riu Palace. Two staff members in particular, Tamara van der Borgh and Sandra Guerrero Varela, were extraordinary in their service to the guests. Any question at all about the resort, activities, life in Playa del Carmen, they were ready to answer. Again, I am not sure how the Riu is able to attract and retain such exceptional staff -- but kudos to the management for having the foresight to have Tamara and Sandra on staff. They are gems and I miss them already. I arrived with very high expectations. They were met on all occassions. The Riu has clearly merited a return trip from my family -- and as long as Manuel still greets visitors at the door, and Tamara and Sandra work to ensure that the guests are treated as special as they are -- the Riu Palace will have my loyalty. I hope that this review will encourage others to visit. I am already planning a return visit for my family and friends.

For those considering a destination wedding-do it if you can go with the flow-it was an absolute blast and I was swimming on the beach the day of the wedding. Although some items went wrong it wasnt enough to ruin my day. My suggestion-just because it seems easier than a wedding at home still do your homework and be super organized. (From this site I concluded that the wedding coordinators only do so much) Yes, the wedding coordinators are not as organized as they could be. So make sure that you ask alot of questions and give tasks-my expectation was that they would handle things the way they handle weddings here in the states. Nope. They did forget that at our toast we ordered margaritas and champagne-had champagne only with no one to open or serve. They delivered the cakes to the bar area where we were having the toast-but no big deal-I just asked the waiter to take them to el Patio, which they did. The wedding coordinators were no where in site after the ceremony ended-literally, so they werent there to help when I needed it-for example a server to pour the champagne. The food (El Patio) was fantastic and the service excellent. I had prime rib for my wedding dinner. The cake tasted AWFUL, but not my priority anyway-dont order extra it is a waste-the one that comes with the wedding package is pretty enough for pics and symbolic to cut. The most confusion came from the day passes my outside guests had to buy. Make sure to negotiate a rate for day passes. They said 45 then 65 then 90 for a day pass, then tried to charge my guests 95 each the day of. Luckily I told them the price and they negotiated them for the entire day. The wedding coordinators tried to charge them extra-they know the prices so it didnt make me happy-I just thought they were trying to rip them off. Just so you know people can attend the 'ceremony only' for free if they are not staying at the hotel. Or they is a way to get to the beach right beside the hotel without passing through the lobby-guests could just enter there. I brought extra decorations for the tables and ceremony and the wedding coordinators did an excellent job on decorating to my specifications and they also played all my songs correctly during the ceremony-I teach drama so I made a cue sheet for them. I think that may have helped. We married on the beach, and yes everyone gathered around, which bothered me at first -but when it came time for me to walk down the beach I didnt see anyone except my fiance. It was neat to have people give us congrats the next day-everyone was very respectful and quiet during our ceremony-I was afraid of the topless beach thing and the pictures. Ha. The pictures are phenomenal. They are totally worth it. The wedding coordinators didnt direct my guests away from us during the photos so many guests jumped in the middle of our session-the sun was setting so we had to hurry. It was hard to be bride and coordinator but be aware you may need to assign a friend to shuffle people around the hotel after the ceremony. The pastor Kiko Flores was great! They excepted the changes I made to the ceremony and his reflection and support was great. Flowers were beautiful! We rented the ballroom at the Yucatan and that was fun-the DJ was good-I brought my own music just in case I wanted something specific. The person who did my hair at the spa did an excellent job too-I did my own makeup. The rooms, food and service are top notch along with the grounds. yes, bed are hard. No smell in our rooms. We were moved to a Jacuzzi suite and they are very sweet indeed. Jacuzzi on the second story patio with a big patio area. I could have just had my reception up there-it will hold about 30 people. Other suggestions for a wedding-the El Dorado Seaside Suites would be very romantic and the Iberostar seems way more organized than the RIU. Yes, there were mistakes (mistakes are made at home too) but all in all is was incredibly beautiful.

The Riu Palace has beautiful grounds which are emaculately groomed. The rooms are also emaculate. The food and entertainment are good, not excellent, but good. There are several restraunts. However, you have to make reservations each morning before 10:30 for the restaurant of your choice for that evening. You cannot make reservations in advance, they must be made each morning. They have two sittings, I believe they are 6:30 and 9:30. If you are not at the desk early in the morning to make your reservation, you will be scheduled for the late sitting. Also, you may not be able to make a reservation at the restraunt of your choice. If you do not make it to the desk in time to make your reservation, you may be out of luck and your options will be to eat at the buffet restaurant or try your luck with the restaurant that you wanted to make reservations for and ask if they have any cancellations. You can't make reservations at a restaurant your first night unless you get to the resort very early in the morning. Our first night, we ate at the buffet. We forgot to make dinner reservations for one night, and we were turned away from the restaurant which we attemtpted to dine in, even though they had empty tables available. Bar service around the pool area was also very poor. It wasn't because the help that they had wasn't trying, it's just that they didn't have enough help to cover the area. You could easily wait more than 30 minutes before help would come around. The swim up bar was not always manned. The service not what you would expect at a resort with such a high rating. Our room was very clean. We were on the second floor and it was very noisy. We were woke up every morning around 6:00 by the people upstairs and the small children in the room next to us. The walls are very thin and you can hear the conversations in the room next to you. Also, our air conditioning unit did not work very well. Each night it felt like our bed linens were damp and we would stick to the blankets. The humidity in the room made it difficult to sleep. We attemped to upgrade or even just change our room with the front desk. They were not very helpful. As a matter of fact, the first question that they asked was who did we book through. When we replied \"Apple Vacations\", they indicated they had no other room to move us to. However, we met a couple who arrived after our arrival date. They were not satisfied with their room and requested to be moved. They were moved to another room. We have traveled quite a bit. We love beach vacations. However, this resort is situated so that there are no ocean views. We really missed the ocean view and the sounds from the ocean. The beach is very clean and it is nice for walking. Also, it is very nice to be able to stop at the other Riu resorts and be able to swim in their pools, or have a drink at their bars or even enjoy lunch in their restraunts. This resort is rated a 6 golden apple by Apple Vacations. Therefore, our expectations were high. I would not rate this a 6 golden. This may be a 6 golden for the area of Play Del Carmen, but it really wasn't as nice as other resorts we have visited that were rated less. We decided that the accomodations were not going to ruin our vacation. We had a great time.

The Riu Palace had been highly recommended to us by friends, and all positive reports turned out to be perfectly accurate. The staff at the Riu Palace are wonderful. Everyone was friendly and extremely helpful. The PR folks walk around constantly chatting with guests to make sure that all is well. The room was great. Large and well-equipped. Excellent sound-proofing -- we couldn't hear TVs or any other noise from other rooms. The veranda was very nice as well. The food was great too, and there was a lot of it. Let's just say we availed ourselves of the buffets at Don Julian. Will hit the gym tomorrow as a consequence. Drinks were fun and plentiful. Other guests were pleasant, although why people think it's okay to smoke cigars in the presence of others is beyond me. There weren't too many cigar smokers there, but one cigar is too many in my book. Not many kids, and the only teenagers/young twenty-somethings were there with their parents. If you're looking to avoid spring breakers, the Riu Palace is a good place to go. The beach is awesome and much better than the other beach property we saw in the area (and we visited several other resorts, just out of curiosity). Always plenty of room, and lots of trees. The water is gorgeous. We didn't spend any time in the pool area (except to grab a drink at the bar), but it was very pretty. Location was great. Very nice to have Playa del Carmen so nearby (a nice 30 minute walk). We took a bus to Cancun and spent the day there. Ugh. If you like being surrounded by lots of people and noise, Cancun may suit you. We, on the other hand, were looking to escape the city, and Riu Palace Mexico was perfect for that. We ate lunch at the Riu Cancun while we were in Cancun, and the hotel was much more rambunctious and loud (and the guests were much younger) than at the Palace. It certainly appears that if you do your homework, you can pick a Riu which suits your personality. Chichen Itza was great, despite picking a rainy and rather cold day to go. We took the bus, rather than a tour, and thus were able to see it at our own pace. In summary, we highly recommend the Riu Palace Mexico.

We were there from 3/19 to 3/26 & it wasn't long enough! I tend to be a harsh critic, but I could not find one thing to complain about. I am very mold sensitive & I was concerned after reading some of the previous postings before we left, but I saw no evidence of mold anywhere in our room or anywhere else on the property. We were on the second floor facing the Wyndham & we never heard any noise from that resort at all & we are usually asleep by midnight. I was amazed at how clean the resort was kept--from our room which was cleaned twice a day to the pool area restrooms which were always being checked/restocked & cleaned. All of the people that worked at the resort were extremely helpful & friendly & would go out of their way to make you feel welcome--they seemed genuinely happy to assist you (a rare occurrance nowadays!). The food at the resort was fantastic--such a variety of choices! We ate at all of the reservation restaurants & liked the gourmet (Sir Edward) the best--the filet mignon was great & the lambchops suberb! For atmosphere, the beach steakhouse was very nice, although my husbands steak wasn't the greatest. I had the tuna steak which was excellent--I would recommend that instead of the steak. The Japanese restaurant had very good food & atmosphere also but we had a late lunch in town & I think we were still too full to fully enjoy it. The Brazilian restaurant was good but not our favorite--too much meat for us. As for the drinks, we usually drink wine or beer but we did try some of the frozen drinks & they were very good (maybe not super strong alcohol wise but you are drinking all day--probably better off this way!) Also, I would think if you requested an extra shot of alcohol in your drink the staff would happily comply. The beer that is served is Corona on tap & the wines were better than I expected. We did not like the Villamor wine (Portugese or Spanish I think) but we liked the Calafia (Mexican)alot (both red & white were good) & we had a rose' from Spain with dinner one night & it was also good. They also had a Chilean Cabernet that was very good. For dinner they will bring you a bottle of wine & put it on a stand next to your table which was a nice touch. They have nightly shows at 9:45pm either in the courtyard or on the stage (check with someone to find out where the show will be to get a good seat). They did a rendition of Grease that was very cute and had a traditonal Mayan ritual in full costume in the courtyard that was very interesting to see. We found the pool area very nice & although it would get crowded chairs were readily available all day long. The swim up pool bar is nice & if you bring an insulated mug from home they will fill it & your drinks stay cold. The beach is also very nice, again alot of available chairs & not as crowded most days as the pool. If it seems too hot by the pool, the beach gets the ocean breeze & will be a little cooler. We did decide to walk into PDC one day & my only advice is not to do this mid-day when it's 90 degrees & sunny. It was further than we thought & actually on that day we didn't make it into the center of town (which is the nicest part) because we were too hot & knew we still had to walk all the way back. There are alot of discount souvenir stands in town, so I would recommend buying souvenirs there rather than in the complex (t-shirts were $3 at one store in town & were the same as $12-$15 dollar ones at the little shops near the resort). Another thing, I don't think I would recommend this walk late at night unless you are in a large group. It isn't well lit at all. On our second walk there, we came back just after dark & there were still alot of other people walking around so it was fine. The only bad thing that happened during the entire trip was on the first or second day I got bit by something (mosquitos??)all over my leg. It was extremely itchy & we had to buy some cream to put on it from a pharmacy. I believe I got bitten on our room balcony because it faced the back of the complex & that area probably doesn't get sprayed for insects as much. My advice is if you are the type to get bitten by mosquitos at home (my husband is not -- not one bite ever!!) bring insect repellent & wear it after sunset. I brought some but never saw any mosquitos so I didn't think I needed it. After my episode I would wear it every night & never got any more bites. We did walk through all of the other Riu complexes & definately thought the Riu Palace Mexico was much nicer than all of the others. We met many nice people from England, Germany, Norway & of course all over the U.S. It seems that this resort does have alot more Europeans than the others & we enjoyed meeting & talking with them. To sum up a long review, I would just say that we thought that the Riu Palace exceeded our expectations on all accounts --the complex was beautiful/staff wonderful/rooms very large & clean/food was out of this world/the wine & other drinks very good/beach & pool exceptional--and would definately recommend it if you are looking for a nice relaxing vacation.

Hotel grounds: Amazing, clean, and beautiful The beach: Pleantly of chairs and shade could always be found, sometimes you had to get a little creative with the positioning of your chair. After walking up and down the beach looking at the other resorts near by, I am convinced that our beach was the nicest because there was pleantly of room between the chairs The pool: Again pleanty of chairs and shade. I had read reviews about the water being cool, but we found the water to be a great temperature, as did many others who were swimming. The rooms: I was a little nervous about reading the reviews about the mold on the couch. So the first thing we did was to inspect the couch. We saw no evidence of mold, but we were also on the second level. My only complaint was that the safe was rather small and was not electronic, but that is just small potatoes. The room did have an interesting smell, but to me it is the smell that all tropical places have and I did not notice it after the first day. The food: The food was good. The guacamole was amazing!! Breakfast was my favorite. I consider myself a very picky eater and will not eat any seafood. I always found enough to eat. We stayed at the buffet for most nights. We tried the steakhouse \"El Patio\" and it was good as well. They served steak, chicken, fish, ribs, and a vegatable entree so at that everyone could find something to eat there. We did not get sick at all, but we did had ciprofloxacin on hand just incase. The drinks: Not very strong. But by having weak drinks you can sample more cocktails from the menu. I recommend the \"Passion Dreams\". The staff and service: The staff was very polite and helpful. The service was outstanding, the best we have had at an all inclusive. We did bring along $1 bills to tip with. I don't think it improved our service, but the staff was very appreciative and we would have felt bad not tipping. The one place where it might have made a difference was with the maid-we got towel animals! Other: Make sure to bring lots of sunscreen because it is very expensive to purchase at the hotel!", "Date": "March 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4722540", "Content": "We stayed at the Riu Palace Mexico from March 9th through March 16th.

Here is my version of the short story concerning this hotel. We are from Texas, USA. -Hotel, grounds, beach, staff - primo, posh euro style. Beach is huge, palm trees had leaves torn off by hurricane, so not as much shade as there used to be as reported by return guests. -Rooms The Bad - Unbearable Bad Mildew - tried to switch, but it was more problem than it was worth. They gave us the run around, and I just wanted to get on with my honeymoon. Just dealth with it. My wife is very sensitive to molds, and it made her a little sick during the stay. Noisy on perimeter of hotel due to adjacent hotels. If you don't go to bed until 1:00, or pass out at night, not a problem. Didn't really bother me. -Rooms The Good - Very nice decor and water pressure. Nice bar in room -Food - Very good buffets. Also available is specialty restaraunts that require reservations, but very hard to get reservations. Must get up at 8:30AM the day of reservation, and then you might get a 9:00PM reservation if you are lucky. They schedule 6:30, and 9:00, that is all. -Drinks - OK. We all seem to think liquor is watered down by staff. By we all - I mean everyone we met during our stay - people from other countries, etc. Also, they do not carry premimum liquors, or at least what we consider permium liquors in Texas. -Age of Guests - ranged from 5-80. As a 41 year old that is 29 years old at heart, I felt there were a lot of old people there. However, I happen to like old people, so that was fine. Its better than putting up with punks who have just had their 1st beer ever. Just don't plan on coming down here looking to pick up young chicks at this hotel, you won't find many. Now on the other hand, if you are a woman that wants to do a little gold digging, this might be the place for you. A few \"stuffy\" ones in the crowd as well. I just didn't let them get to me. A few topless Grannies, didn't really need to see that...... a few topless hunees - that was nice - they were from other hotels, walkng down our beach. -Guests were from international locations all over the world. This was a cool. I enjoy meeting people from other countries. I've been to hotels in MX that everyone was from Houston. That is great, just attempting to explain this is not one of those places. -SCUBA - Got one 45' dive in, then too windy to get boat out after that. 45' dive was bad. reefs covered in sand. They owe me a refund, but I'll probably never see the money. One thing I've learned in Mexico is to pay as you go. Scuba crew was decent, but I've had better. They do not have a boat dock, but they do pull the boat in near the beach and you wade over to it with your equipment. You only bring yourself and your equipment. Leave sunglasses, towels, sunscreen etc behind. -Nightlife - Nice shows, I'm not much of a show guy. Nice dance club across the street, same hotel chain. Opens at 11:00PM and gets a little punkish after 12:45. -Gym - Weights are old, but functional for the most part. I've seen better in other resorts. Nice setting though, near the beach, with lots of open windows. They need to put more effort into maintaining it, because it has lots of potential. -Pool - Nice, but cold -Hot Tubs - COLD. -Bar - Very posh, european style. -Trip from airport - about 45 minutes to 1.5 hours depending on circumstances. they will return you to airport about 3 hours early if you let them. Wife got sick last night. She is adament about not drinking water, ate same thing everyone else ate except for the mussels, which she indicated did not taste right so she quit eating them immediately. Will I go back??? Probably not.

I did not see any mold, but thought the smell was that of heavy upholstery and drapes that have been in humid weather. Our room -- and the hotel -- were very clean. I was impressed that the hotel had small maintenance projects going on daily --- freshly painted trash cans, newly washed windows, etc. The entertainment was lame, but we were there to relax as a family, so we were happy there were lots of nice places to sit and have a drink so that we could talk. We took a trip to Chichen Itza one day -- it was a 12-hour day and, while we enjoyed it, would not have done it if we knew the bus would stop at a touristy souvenir shop for 30 minutes and that we would have to change buses on the side of the highway!

The grounds are beautiful, the workers are constantly pruning and grooming the property, the grounds are spectacular, but this resort puts nothing into the rooms. The moment that I entered the room I knew I was in trouble. The smell of the mold just totally overwhelms you. The sofa in my room and my childrens room was covered in mold, there was a cigarette burn hole in the comforter in my room, it was old and ragggedy. The final straw for me was when I found lipstick on the pillow in the childrens room and they do not wear lipstick.

Hotel Grounds - the grounds to the hotel are beautiful and very well kept. Every day the hotel staff were working so hard to keep the hotel grounds clean and well groomed. They worked so hard and did a fabulous job. They always greeted us with a smile on their face when we would pass by. The floor tiles shined, the chandeliers sparkled and the hotel was very very clean. The hotel rooms are big and beautiful and the service in the hotel rooms was fabulous. We would walk into animals made of towels, a rose on the bed and a thank you card for staying at the RIU. After our first night, the front desk called our room to see if there was anything that we needed and how we were enjoying our stay....great service. We received hotel room service every morning and every night. They would make our beds in the morning and get our room ready for night time. Food - There was a lot of variety in food and it was all delicious. We went to the specialty restaurants and really enjoyed the Japanese and loved the French restaurant. We also went to the Brazilian restaurant, but didn't enjoy that as much. The buffets were good and everything seemed so fresh. Lots of variety to meet all tastes. Service - The service was outstanding. There was always someone to offer a helping hand when we had a question. There was always someone to make sure our glasses were full whether it be at the dinner table or bar. All of the staff were always so pleasant after working such long hours. I really praise the staff as they really worked hard. There was always a smile on their faces. Entertainment - The hotel entertainment kept us busy with their daily activities and their nightly shows. The dancers worked really hard in the evening and did a great job. It was nice to have access to the other RIU hotels so that we could enjoy their facilities as well. The new hotel that just opened has an amazing pool. Beach - The beach was absolutely beautiful. It was long and wide and we never had any trouble getting a lounger. The ocean is a beautiful green/blue colour and was so very warm. There are lots of activities to do on the beach, such as parasailing, wave runners, scuba diving, snorkeling, etc. A lot of people were walking around selling silver, cigars and sunglasses. Not pushy at all and they were selling things at good prices. After taking a walk on the beach, I think our hotel had one of the best parts of the beach. Out of all the RIU hotels we had access too, we definitely liked the RIU Palace Mexico best and would stay there again. It was nice to have access to the disco across the street and it seemed real lively there, but as much fun as that was, it was nice to go back to a hotel that was quite. The Riu Palace, Riviera was beautiful, but it almost seemed too much. We loved everything about the RIU Palace Mexico and can't wait to go again.

It was our first time visiting Mexico. I pretty much knew what to expect after reading all of the reviews. The Palace met most all of my expectations. Lobby and Grounds: Spotless and beautiful. Pool: Some of the previous reviews mentioned that the pool was small, but it looked plenty big to me. We never actually used the pool. Beach: Incredible! Beautiful soft white sand, aqua blue warm water, plenty of loungers and shady spots. Bar is a short walk away. We loved the \"Costa Caribe\" frozen drinks! There were a few topless women on the beach, but it wasn't really noticible if you weren't looking for it. We absolutely LOVED the beach. Food: Pretty good. I'm not a big fan of buffets, but there was so much food that it would be difficult not to find something that you liked to eat. The fruit bar at dinner was amazing and the coconut ice cream was the best I've ever had. We all drank the water at lunch and dinner and ate plenty of fruit, salad and veggies and nobody got sick or had any stomach issues. Room: Stayed in room 1120. Looked pretty much like the pictures. Good sized room with a small sitting area and balcony. We had a garden view on the Viva Maya side. I kind of wish that I hadn't seen the posted picture of the moldy couch because even though our couch was not moldy, it still kind of gave me the creeps. I actually never sat on it. One morning I looked outside and noticed three couches out in the grass. I guess they may have a problem with those couches getting moldy and were trying to dry them in the sun. Our room did not have any moldy smell at all and was very clean. The bathroom was fine - decent size. Only issue was the lack of light in the shower, but it was really not a big deal. One thing... if you are looking for a quiet room, I would ask for one on the Riu Yucatan side. Every night between 10 and 11 the entertainment would start at the Viva Maya and it was LOUD! We could hear it CLEARLY, even with the sliding door closed as our room was directly across from the entertainment area. The music ranged from a Nora Jones type singer to a Santana cover band, which actually started at 11pm. We didn't really mind it most nights, but the Santana night nearly sent me over the edge. We were exhausted from a long day at Chichen Itza and had difficulty getting to sleep until it was over. Hey, we dealt with it. Not worth getting stressed about, but if you go to bed early and like things quiet, ask for a room on the other side! I was looking forward to seeing the towel art after all of the hype, but never did. We did tip daily, but never got towel art. We did get some beautiful flowers in the bath one day though! Staff: Great service. Incredibly warm and friendly people. I LOVED Manuel the doorman and Eduardo at the dinner buffet. One thing I also wanted to mention... We booked a day trip to Chichen Itza through Olympus Tours in the lobby. They ended up calling our room at 11pm to tell us that they would have to move our trip to the following day as they were overbooked. I wasn't crazy about taking a bus tour to begin with and was a bit nervous about renting a car, so I suggested to my husband that we ask if it was possible to hire a driver to take us there. For an additional $24.00 per person, we were able to get a private van and driver to take us! It was WONDERFUL! The driver gave us a tour of the city and explained all of the architecture and history. Once we arrived at C.I., there was a private guide waiting who gave us a tour through the ruins. Both the driver and guide were so passionate about the history of their country and were so wonderful. We felt spoiled having our own guides and wouldn't have gotten half as much out of the experience without them. Definitely worth the extra $24.00 per person (plus tips). I will say that the 3 hour drive was a bit long and about 30-40 minutes of it was over a VERY bumpy road. The tour bus may have been more comfortable, but we were so happy to have our own private van and be able to call our own shots, that it was a small price to pay. All in all it was a great trip.

We loved the fact that the balcony had a high wall. This gives you a little more privacy, if you know what I mean. We had a decent view when standing, no view at all when sitting. The room was cleaned 2 times a day. The only complaint that I had was when we went into Playa del Carmen one evening. My husband was approached to buy some drugs. Again, this was not at the resort. Never did we experience this there. Everything was perfect at the resort. Actually there was everything that we needed there. We didn't have to leave it at all!

When we checked in, there were rose petals sprinkled on the beds and bathroom and towel art in the shape of two swans made into a heart - very nice touch.

Beach: Amazing beach - tons of room, no problem getting a loungechair, very clean beach, crystal clear blue water. It's only a short walk to the beachbar to get a drink and staff does bring drinks to the beach periodically. Food: The food was good, but not great. There was a good variety to choose from at the breakfast buffet and lunch at the El Patio and La Travieta was good too with a good variety to choose from. We also ate ate at La Bodega and Sir Edward which we enjoyed very much. We did not care for the Japanese restaurant at all - the food did not taste fresh. People make too much regarding the dinner reservations - really it's no big deal at all. We never waited in line more than 5 minutes to get a reservation. Entertainment: During the daytime, there are many activities to choose from such as pool volleyball, beach volleyball, darts, scuba, snorkeling, jetskiing, parasailing - something for everyone. The nightime entertainment was nice too. There was always a band in the courtyard playing live music until 11pm and a 9:45pm show in the showlounge. The shows were by no means broadway performances, but were humorously entertaining. Staff: Very friendly staff always sincere and willing to serve you with a smile.

The Mediterrean dinner was lousy. We ended up walking out and hitting the buffet. The dinner buffet was OK - not what I expected. I thought there would be a lot of seafood and it would be very good.

Each night they had a different main meat - prime rib (just OK), ham, pork, etc. Then the potatoes, veggies, etc. There was also a pasta bar at both the lunch and dinner buffet which was very good. Fresh fruit all to die for! We talked to alot of people down there who go all the time and they said the food is the same at all the all-inclusives (except for maybe the really expensive ones?).

Activities all day long - there is large chart in the main lobby that tells you what is going on each day. My husband played beach volleyball every day and there was plenty of room at our beach. Some of other resorts had the volleyball but it was all squeezed in with the chaises, etc. Their beaches were just not as large or as nice as ours.

If I repeat what a lot of the reviews say I apologize. Flight-USAirways. No problems at all either way. The Cancun airport was a madhouse when we were on our way home but the lines went quickly and it was organized. Transfers-Olympus Tours. Very happy with them overall. Friendly, helpful, available at the hotel during the day for questions regarding the resort and excursions they offered. Resort-Spotless. Hard working employees cleaning constantly and maintaining the beautiful grounds. Beautiful fountains, green grass, lovely flowers and palm trees around. CAUTION-Be careful if it rains, the ground is very slippery however there are signs warning of this. I've never seen so much detail in the archetecture anywhere-marble and tiled floors and walls, arched roofs, spiral staircases, huge chandeliers in the lobby, high ceilings, mosaics and intricate woodwork throughout. Check out the chapel in the lobby if you can, it's beautiful. TIP-If you are physically unable to climb steps it's a good idea to get a room on the ground floor. There's only one elevator and it's in the lobby. Pool-I agree with other reviews that it is small and cold as well as the jacuzzi being cold. I liked the mosaic flowers at the bottom of the pool as a decoration though. Plenty of chairs at the pool available most of the days we were there. Plenty of umbrellas and small tables if you need them. Tons of hammocks between the pool area and beach to chill out on. My husband got a spa treatment and enjoyed it. Beach-Amazing. Clean. White sand that doesn't stick much to you. Water-Crystal clear and the bluest I've ever seen. Great waves. Only thing I wasn't too thrilled about were the people walking around trying to sell shells, jewerly and the motorized watersports. They weren't pushy but it was still a tad irritating. Employees-I found them to be extremely friendly yet they weren't overbearing as some can be at other resorts. They know that this particular Riu is one where most people go to relax and not need to be involved in a bunch of loud activities. I loved it. However there were activities every hour if intersted. Room-Fantastic. We were on the top floor with a terrace. Wasn't too flipped on that but it wasn't a huge deal. There are balconies in other rooms where you can see out, just ask for it. Room was sparkling clean and the water pressure in the shower was the best!!! Booze was available (unfortunately I couldn't drink it being preggo) in the room as well as a stocked fridge of water and soda. Don't drink the tap water in the room. The bed was firm but I didn't think it was as awful as some of the reviews said. Definitly a personal preference. Room was made up twice a day. Wonderful wonderful wonderful!!! OH-I did notice a little bit of mold on the top of the couch but if I didn't read the previous review about it, I wouldn't have even noticed! Food-I rate it between very good and fantastic. We didn't like the specialty restaurant (Sir Edwards) b/c the service was slow and our fish was dry. The buffet was awesome, so was the steakhouse (nice-it's on the beach), the Japanese restaurant was good and we didn't try the Brazilian one. Please--it's ok to drink the water they provide to you as well as eat the fruit and vegetables. We did not get sick at all. TIP-if you arrive in the afternoon and want to eat in one of the restaurants that night, go to the restaurant at 6:45 and ask if there's any cancellations. We were able to get a seat at the steakhouse without a problem. We had no problems getting a rez the other nights, we waited no longer than 2 minutes to sign up. It's not a hassle at all. Excursion-We rented a car and drove to Cancun then down to Tulum. Tulum was awesome especially being on the beach. CAUTION-Don't drive like you do at home. The roads are paved well but get extremely slippery when it rains. We saw 2 accidents that day! Just be careful, drive slower than usual and you'll be fine! And go into town (Playa del Carmen) onto 5th Avenue. It's an open street where you can walk down and check out shops, restaurants and bars. The Blue Parrot was fun and it's on the beach. Overall-This IS a 5 star resort for what we paid (good deal) and the experience we had. If you compare it to a Ritz-Carlton or one of the 5 star resorts in America, I would rank it up there, but wouldn't pay the ridiculous amount of money for a Ritz just b/c of the name. I know this was long-winded but hope it was helpful. Have a GREAT time!!

We originally planned to return in 2007 but had such a wonderful time in 2005 that we decided to return again this year. This year, we were a group of 6 and were very pleased to see that (almost) all evidence of the hurricanes at the hotel was gone. Except for the \"cropped\" palm trees, everything was as we remembered it...extremely clean rooms, extremely friendly service. It was fun to see many of the same faces working there from last year. We did notice more children there this year. We were disappointed that each night, there was an activity for the children in the lounge at around 8:45 which cut into the evening entertainment in the courtyard. We also thought we'd see some different entertainment than last year but the shows were pretty much the same. I personally would like to see a better variety of beer (only Corona and Negro Medelo) but that is not a complaint. We did Parasail this year which was beautiful. I recommend you do that mid-week as Friday, Saturday and Sunday were very busy. My wife and I also had massages in the Spa (not on the beach) which did not disappoint. The beach remains one of the very best we've ever been to. It was harder to find shade this time because of the beating the palm trees took during the hurricane but the palm branches are sprouting and will soon be regrown. (Since it was -14 degrees when we left Wisconsin, looking for shade was a nice problem to have). Our only bad experience came in Play del Carmen when we met our wives in town (after they spent the day shopping) to have a drink and dinner at one of the local restaurants. We met at a bar called \"La Pinata\" right on the beach near the pier where the shuttles to Cozumel embark. (La Pinata is NOT the little thatch covered bar right next to the shuttle pier but the next Thatch bar further down the beach). Our first clue should have been when the Mariachi Band demanded $10 after they did a song for us. But the real shock was the $110 bill we got for the 6 beers and 6 margarita's we drank! DON'T GO TO THIS PLACE unless you like $11 margarita's or you feel like getting ripped off. There are plenty of other bars in town where the people are grateful for your business (such as the Tequilla Barrel, or the one we called \"The Swing Bar\" which has rope swings around the bar). We were so put off after our experience at La Pinata that we decided to return to the Riu Palace for dinner. My advice is to visit Playa del Carmen for some fun shopping or to sample the Mexican beers and return to the RIU Palace to enjoy the wonderful amenities and great service that they provide.

So here i go..... First of all, we reserved a private van (Alltournative travel) to take us from the airport to the hotel. It cost us 110.00 round trip. THey were there waiting for us when we got out of the airport. They were also on time picking us up to take us back to the airport. THe van was very clean and the driver was very nice. When we got in the van he asked us if we wanted to stop and get beer or something to drink, which we didn't. We couldn't wait to get to the hotel. Once we arrived at the hotel, we couldn't believe our eyes, the entrance was beautiful and VERY clean. We checked in and were given a drink. THe staff at the front desk was very helpful and nice. We arrived at our room and couldn't believe how big it was even the bathroom. Very clean! We had a stocked refrigerator which was also included and an alcohol dispenser which also was included. The room did smell musty but i think they all do in Mexico. The beds were kind of hard so we requested a pad for it and they came right away. We did not have a room facing the courtyard which would of been beautiful. Our balcony was very big. They have two lawn chairs and you could actually layout there. The pool area was very clean and you do not need to get up extra early to get a chair. The pool water was very cold. THere were servers constantly walking around the pool asking if you needed a drink. THe beach was very nice but the water was also cold. THe one thing we didn't like about the beach is that it was a tiresome walk from the beach up to the pool area. You have to walk up a hill. THere were no servers on the beach you had to walk to a nearby bar. The only thing we really hated was you had to get up early to make reservations to the resturants. You have to get out of bed between 8:30-10:30 and go down and make reservations. They really need to change that. We really liked Miyagi and The Patio. Those were the only two we ate at, besides Don Julian (buffet). We thought the food was good at all of the above. We had no complaints. Although my husband and i are very simple eaters. The staff at all the resturants were very friendly and catered to your needs. The breakfast buffet was also very good with a lot to choose from. The lunch buffet at La Traviata and Il Patio were both very good. They do try to change up the food daily, they never had the same thing twice in a row. But don't expected to not see the same foods changed up in the buffet. But all of it was good. THe cleaning people were very nice and catered to your every need. Anything you needed you would call the front desk and they would have someone up to your room within 10 minutes. NO SIGNS OF THE HURRICANES!!! THe evening shows were very good so don't miss them. My husband loved the pool activities and did them every day. The activity staff is very friendly. All in all, we had a great trip and highly recommend this hotel to couples. There were not a lot of kids there so i don't know if you would want to bring your kids. This is a very relaxed hotel no partying. So if that is what your looking for, this hotel is not for you.

Ok so here we go...we booked the six apple deal, where you don't know which six apple hotel you are staying at, but you know it is \"six apples/stars\". We were pleasantly surprised when we arrived at the Riu. We were both taken back by the larger than life architecture and cleanliness. Getting there was a hassel...we paid for private transfers but we found out our travel agent never told apple about them. We quickly forgot about the trip to the hotel as we were handed a cold drink and treated like royalty. As most people do when they arrive, they walk around to check everything out and we were more impressed with every step we took and every where we looked. And then the real vacation started... the FOOD was absolutely horrible. Each day we would look forward to our meals and were always let down. What was served HOT for breakfast was usually served COLD for lunch and then STIRFRYED for dinner. and it all SUCKED!!! The same goes for the breads, salads and desserts. I lived on tortilla chips and fries for a week. the SERVICE was constantly working, but they never seemed to wait on my husband and I. At the buffet you were lucky to get someone's attention to get you a disgusting cup of what they called American coffee. the ACTIVITIES were lame. there was no one trying to get the shy people involved. it's always entertaining to see the people who are normally reserved act crazy on vacation. there definately missing that charismatic soul in their entertainment staff. i hate to be that person who complains about non English speaking people in a different country, but let's keep it real...you are catering to mostly Americans (who speak English) We could rarely find someone whom we could ask a question without pointing to the object or attempting to use my few words of Italian to find some similar words. Besides the other couples we met there and the abundance of lounge chairs around the pool I would not have to many good things to say about the Riu. Oh and by the way the APPLE REPRESENTATIVE at the hotel was soooooooooo rude. As we arrived we attempted to explain our whole private transfer debacle to her and she seemed bothered by the fact that we had interruppted her while she was tending to her personal credit card statement. She bascially told as that we were lucky to have been booked at the Riu considering our six apple deal, so we really shouldn't bother with concerning ourselves with out loss of money from the private transfers. No sooner did she pick up her personal cell phone while we were trying to resolve our issue, so we left her and started our \"vacation\" Thank the Lord for beautiful weather, because my only memories are my tanned skin which will soon fade along with the desire to ever return to Mexico. remember the food is horrible, so if you do go...pack some protein bars or mac and cheese.", "Date": "February 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cThe Way to Go\u201d", "Author": "Vance22", "ReviewID": "UR4466950", "Content": "My wife and I just spent a week in this hotel and really enjoyed it.

I must say, the Riu's in Playacar Mexico hardly had any damage due to Wilma last November. The Riu that got hit the worst believe it or not was the Riu Tequila, which is across the street from the beach! But it is back up and running. They did add another pool to the Riu Yucatan to help alleviate the people coming from the Tequila to use their facility since they are on the beach. The beaches are actually bigger (and they were quite big before). They are now opening the new Riu Palace Riviera Maya about 6 doors away from the Riu Palace Mexico. The biggest difference I can see is the tubs have jacuzzi's and instead of the seam in the middle of the KING BEDS, it is an actual King Size Bed. Plus, it is brand new!

Ages: 33 and 34 Length of stay: 10 days Number of previous visits to Mexico: approximately 10 This was not my husband and I's first all-inclusive vacation to Mexico so going into this 10 day vacation I was confident in our hotel choice because I was reading reviews daily and checking multiple sites to ensure good food (10 days is a long time if the food isn't good) and a non-party atmosphere (parties in Mexico go 'til the wee hours). Rest was the key to this long awaited vacation. Iberostar Tucan was rated #1 at the time but because we stayed at Iberstar Paraiso del Mar with our family the last time, we decided to try a new brand and make it our own experience, a second honeymoon of sorts. LOBBY AND GROUNDS: RIU Palace Mexico is a nice resort. When you walk into the lobby it is grand. Looks like something you would see in Europe and smells like India (Nag Champa incense is burning through out the day). Although beautiful, it was a bit much with the giant crystal chandeliers. The grounds are well kept and the fountains are beautiful. At times I felt I was in a Piazza in Italy as you can see in a photo. POOL: The pool is small and inconvenient. There are not steps into the pool, only ladders. The water was cold. Most guests were complaining of the temperature of the pool. The swim up bar is in the shade to top it off. You are only allowed one towel per towel card and they do not cover the lounger. When it was 90 degrees, the chair pads got VERY hot and burned our feet. The next day I tipped the towel associate and signed I would return all 4 towels in order to get them. Not a 5 star experience to say the least. BEACH: The beach is beautiful. Crystal clear and warm. Much warmer than the pool. Tons of lounge chairs and water sports available (when it's not windy which was 3 out of 10 days). Occasionally they would come through with trays of fruity drinks for refreshment which was a nice touch. The beach itself is crowded. RIU Tequila is across the street so they are on \"our\" beach too. The trade off is they have the disco that we can use. Resorts are on top of each other in Playacar so all you see is people. There are topless sun bathers which was great. Go for it ladies...you only live once! FOOD: The food was great. Sure you can eat french fries and fried jalapenos if you want but we were thrilled with the selection of meats and veggies. The salad bar is outstanding. There is a full Mexican food station, a carving station, pasta station (including shrimp and chicken), show cooking, fresh baked breads and desserts. The \"snack dinner\" from 10pm 'til 6am is a joke. Ham sandwiches and fruit...that's it. Nothing sweet after dinner closes. Kinda silly I think. Don't be fooled by room service...it is for continental breakfast only. TIPS: At Iberostar tips are DISCOURAGED during the stay and you tip at the end of the visit which really is nice. Tips are expected at RIU. Part of why we chose an all-inclusive is to not have to worry about carrying around money and change, etc. It would be easier to stay at a non-inclusive and charge the room for services rather than the hassle of tips. SERVICE: The service is outstanding in every area. We had to change our room and they were as accomodating as possible. ROOM: The musty smell that others spoke of in the postings are not to be taken lightly. I, unfortunately, did not listen. Because we live on the beach I assumed it was the damp smell that most are not used to. I was very wrong. RIU Palace Mexico has a serious mold problem and there are photos you can see with our own eyes. As soon as we opened the door we could smell mold. We opened the doors and hoped it would go away. It was evening time so we ran off to dinner. The next morning it was so bad we bagan smelling around to find the source of the problem. The couch was covered in mold. The dresser stunk of it and the shower was moldy too. Aside from the mold, the bathroom was small and certainly not 5 stars. I give it 1. RESORT IS FOR: Over 50 years and older. The kids area is a joke and the entertainment is for over 50. In all, we had a nice time but would not return to this resort. Besides the mold, it did not \"feel\" like we were in Mexico. The horrible 80's love songs like \"Wind beneath my wings\" and overdone decor is not what Mexico means to us. We prefer Mexican music and authentic decor when we visit Mexico. Can you imagine listening to Mariachi music in Venice, Italy? I didn't think so. Certainly not a 5 star resort. SIDE NOTE: We did visit the new RIU Palace Riviera Maya which has an amazing pool. It too is a beautiful resort. We spoke to a couple that was staying there and we asked how the rooms are. They said the rooms were comfortable but over all it didn't feel like they were in Mexico.

The only draw backs to the room were the hard beds (can live with it) and the small bathroom (what's up with the bidet..do people still use these??!!) You can't use the tap water to brush your teeth. They'll give you extra bottles of water for this. I can't say enough about how beautiful the beach was. The best I've been to since visiting the USVI. The food was good.

I think pants at a buffet is a bit much, as long as you're clean, nice shorts, what's the big deal?? The guests seem to be a quieter, more mature croud which we loved! Not much for kids to do, so there were not many little ones. The staff was friendly, professional, efficient. We tipped, but I didn't notice the staff not giving good service if you didn't tip. We greated staff with a good morining, hello, etc, and they would return the gesture! We found a little smile and trying to communicate in Spanish goes a long way.

We were booked at the Riu Yucatan, but were upgraded for our entire trip. We have previously stayed at the Riu Tequila. We had such a wonderful time at this hotel and we can't wait to return. The beach is large and there were always plenty of loungers. We were always able to find shade in the afternoon. The staff, especially the Entertainment team, made this trip really great. We participated in 1 or 2 activites every day. The Entertainment team knew our names within days and were always friendly. They really make an effort to connect with the guests. Other service was very good. As for the drink service on the beach, while nice, you may only get one drink the whole morning if you wait for them. For service at the pool, if you tip, the waitress will remember you and come by more often. We also noticed that the inner circle of loungers got served more often than the outer circle. Pool and whirlpools are not heated. The food was acceptable, but not memorable. The buffet offers many, many options. Vegetarians will have enough to eat. We ate at La Bodega twice becaused we enjoyed the different meats. We also ate at Sir Edwards which was also good, but mostly because it was different than the buffet. Service at these restaurants was excellent. We did not get sick at all while there. For the dress code, my husband got by with 2 pairs of pants and 2 polo shirts, which he only used for dinner and then changed into shorts. I panicked because I had expected to wear shorts to dinner (we were supposed to be at the Yucatan!) and only had 1 dress outfit and a pair of jeans. I opted to wear the jeans and a nice top at the buffet because I saw other people doing the same thing. The grounds are clean and well-kept. Our room was also very clean. We were in 0004, which was not the best room because the staff used that hallway in the mornings and the evening which created a lot of noise. Our room had a musty smell, but we figured it had flooded at least somewhat during the hurricane. Maybe the higher rooms wouldn't be so bad. The front desk had the worst service overall. During check-in and check-out, we had to stand in front of the desk until someone took the time to notice us. We had a light bulb burn out in our room and when we reported the problem the person explained that there are two light switches and we were using the wrong one. When we said, no, we are using the right one, he said ok, ok, I'll have someone fix it. It felt like we were tolerated, not welcomed. We brought mugs to use for our drinks. At any time I could have looked around and seen someone else with a mug; they were common. We only used ours a few times and tipped when we did. Other than that and tipping for service by the pool, we did not tip. Blended drinks are not strong. There are also drinks without alcohol. Mixed drinks had the right amount of alcohol. Then, there are also shots. All alcohol was brand-name: Jim Beam, Southern Comfort, Chivas, Beefeaters, Bacardi, Havanna Club etc. Beer selection included Corona and Modelo Negra. There are not very many kids at this hotel, which was nice. The kids that were there were very well behaved. There is no kids program, but there was a kids disco every night before the show. There's something for everyone here. The average age of a guest at this hotel is higher than at the surrounding Rius, but there is a great mix of people and nationalities. The mood of this hotel is more subdued than that of the other Rius, but there's always fun to be found. Young (like us, mid-twenties) or old, you will find what you are looking for here.

I had been to Playa Del Carmen several times, most recently to the Iberostar Quetzal/Tucan. I was excited to try the Palace because I had heard so many good things. First of all, the hotel is beautiful. Grounds are well-kept and gorgeous. Rooms are spacious and well-appointed. Beds were just fine with the mattress pads (ordered them when I arrived). It is a very quiet hotel, which was nice. I especially liked the door you could close between the room door and the bed--helped keep the room quiet. I liked the convenience to the small shopping area across the street and enjoyed the mile walk to town for shopping. The buffets were a bit \"off\" in quality and redundant--breakfasts were best. I went to 2 specialty restaurants: Steak house and Japanese. The Japanese restaurant wasn't good; the steak house was better. The smoking everywhere was REALLY irritating--very hard to escape. I'm happy the smokers could have a resort to love; I'm just hoping the smoke comes out of all my stuff! Yuck! Although the bartenders/waiters/waitresses are very nice, service was spotty. They have a goofy rule where a \"head waiter\" takes your drink order, hands it to a waiter/waitress, and then that person brings you your drink. Sometimes you got it right away; sometimes you never got it. It was bizarre that you couldn't have bar drinks in the restaurants--only wine, water, beer, and pop. That was a pain if you wanted to stick to one type of liquor all night. Made no sense to me. I really missed the great touches at the Quetzal/Tucan like daily papers, popcorn in the bars, real barbeques on the beach, pop machines throughout the resort, and casual dress at the buffets. One friend commented how funny it was to see women in evening gowns at the \"Old Country Buffet\". Most of the guests seemed to be quiet, smoking, older Europeans. Most of the young couples I met were pretty bored. I missed meeting Canadians who always seem to enjoy Mexico better than anyone!

We thought, why not? This is pretty much my comparison between the Palace and the RIU Cancun. The RIU Palace Mexico in Playa del Carmen was beautiful. The staff was not overly friendly (however, some were) The whole feel of the place was a bit stuffy. After being in Cancun first- I did not feel as relaxed at the Palace. I understand the Palace is a different hotel class than the RIU Cancun, however, I didn\u2019t feel the staff was as \u201coutgoing\u201d as the Cancun staff, but just as accommodating, which was great. The food was very good and the chocolate fountain at dessert was yummy- (get the coconut macaroons and dip them in the chocolate!) I really loved being able to have champagne all the time- the RIU Cancun did not offer it at their bars. Men have to wear pants for dinner- even at the buffet. I thought my husband looked much nicer in his dress shorts and button up shirt than some of the guys who had on jeans- just to accommodate the \u201cpants at dinner\u201d rule. The lobby bar was quite small and quite. We had a ground floor room facing the courtyard and the fountains. It was beautiful. The bathroom showerhead was kind of strange though- you had to take it off the holder or else it would spray right over your head\u2014that was annoying. The balcony was a really nice size, with chairs that can turn into loungers. What was great about the Palace is, they had room service which the RIU Cancun did not (for breakfast only) we enjoyed sitting on the balcony and having our morning coffee and croissants. The pool area was large enough where there were empty loungers. No one was saving chairs (there is a sign that this is not allowed anyway) Drink orders were taken at the pool. The pool was not heated- the pool bar was in the shade- it was a bit chilly and no one was hanging out at the pool bar. It was very quite. Complaints:the beach seemed really far. No staff on the beach for drink orders- you had to walk quite a ways to get a drink. There were too many jet skis in the water- you can smell the oil on the beach and I thought the noise was a bit annoying- try and get a beach chair closer to the RIU Yucatan, you can\u2019t smell the oil down there. I am not a \u201cpartier\u201d, or prefer the party atmosphere and I don\u2019t even drink that much but I must be a Cancun kind of girl at heart.

It was a superb trip. I have been there three times now, and I think this visit was the best as far as the resort and beach aspects. I was given a gift and invited to a special dinner for being a return guest. A big thanks to the folks who decided to go elsewhere because of the hurricane. I was able to get a better price on the resort, a better room, and less crowding at the beach. I hate to say it, but the hurricane was good to us. The entertainment was very good. David is still magnificent at the piano bar and the evenings in the courtyard had a good variety of entertainers. The weather was a little cool to start off with, but the temperature increased as the week progressed. We did have one full day of rain, and then it rained sporadically throughout the week. It didn\u2019t wreck our trip and it provided a little relief from the sun. All of our friends who work at the resort were still there. Manny the doorman is still excellent. Roy at the beach bar entertained all of us and all the waiters delivered superb service throughout the week. We tipped heavily, often, and to as many employees that we could. We even tipped a waiter that never waited on us. We met him on previous trips and felt bad that we didn\u2019t eat at his restaurant. He works at the Miyagi. That was the only restaurant than not everyone wanted to go to. There were six in our group. The beach was better than ever. It is so much bigger now after the hurricane. There were a few pebbles we encountered getting into the water, but nothing major. My husband did stub his toe pretty bad on a rock in the water. We never had this trouble before. I do believe the storm brought in some coral and rocks, but please don\u2019t be alarmed, as it is nothing to be concerned about. The men in our group did do a lot of water sports and loved every minute of it. A big favorite for one of them was walking down to the private beach after the Gala Resort. We also visisted the monkeys that roam between the Iberostar complex and the Riu Yucatan. There are about 15 that live in the trees. We gave them bananas, which they took right out of our hand. We later learned that you really shouldn\u2019t be feeding them so we stopped. I didn\u2019t go in the pools. It being January and all, I don\u2019t usually bother. I brought my Riu class card and received 15% off a massage. We took two quick trips into town. There were a lot of people in town and a lot of purchases being made, especially at the Playa Mart where the prices are really reasonable.

The RIU's biggest assets are the beach and tremendous staff! They do go out of their way to make sure your stay is perfect. The resort is immaculate and always clean. I can not say enough about how hard they work to keep the resort and grounds clean for all their guests. The courtyard area and view of the ocean are priceless! As for the rooms, I don't really think you can get rid of the musty smell when in a tropical area with humidity. And we agree with others on the food, they could use some work. However, as Americans, we are probably just used to our old ways! I would truly recommed this resort to anyone and everyone. I can not say enough about how enjoyable of a stay we had.

It was a very nice resort. I think the problem was I read so many wonderful reviews I expected way too much. We've been to Mexico once a year for over 10 years and while this was one of the nicest resorts, it wasn't the best value. 2 main complaints were the food and the noise of the rooms next door. The food was too greasy for my taste. Spent the 4th day of my trip in the bathroom all night and bed all day. Not fun. Our neighbors next door were simply rude. I had to call on them everynight. Their TV was so loud I could hear it word for word. The staff was very good about fixing the problem. Even went into the room one night when the people were so out of it they didn't hear the phone ring a million times or the banging on the door. Please be considerate of your neighbors. It really can make or break a trip. The drinks were very good. Esp at the lobby bar! I think her name was Miriam (like I said they were good) She really knows how to make a good everything! I did request one of the mattress covers and that did make a world of difference. I was a bit disappointed in the fact that it is not a real king bed. We ate at all of the specialty resturants and wished we hadn't wasted our time. The Sir Edwards was nice and we would go there again, but the buffet does have a better selection than the others and I think it tasted better than the other specialties. The beach was really crowded when we were there, but that could have been the week we were there. The staff was very helpful and friendly. All in all I guess my trip was OK. Actually at the last minute I found it cheaper on sale and because I was paying $1000 less than I originally booked for I was happy. If I had paid the original price I would be complaining alot more. It was a good trip, but I don't think I will ever go back there. As a reference, last year we went to Paradisus Rivera, and it was more \"palace like\" to me. I think I will go there again.

I myself have traveled enough times to the Caribbean to have set a pretty high standard when it comes to resorts. It was difficult to find a low cost, high quality honeymoon vacation. After extensive research, we selected the Riu and don't regret our decision at all. We did, however, have a few bumps. A couple weeks before our trip, Hurricane Wilma decided to make land and for over a week after it passed, we were unsure if we were going to get our honeymoon in Mexico. Not knowing what the condition was of the Riu, we decided to go ahead and continue our plans to come here. Thankfully our travel agent was able to send us pictures of the aftermath, and that eased our minds. Not being a regular to Palm trees, I honestly wouldn't have noticed the damage once we stepped onto the resort grounds. As all others have stated, the grounds are immaculate - there's simply no other word for it. Walking out onto the courtyard almost took my breath away (and made me wish we had a room facing it). The check in was quick and they gave us those yummy punch drinks. Just as we were about to go to our room and crash for the day, our travel group stopped us and told us we needed to come back later that night to arrange our pickup to go back to the airport later that week. We told him we were exhausted and asked if we could do it in the morning. We ended up checking out our room and then going out for a short walk around the resort to get a bite to eat. I think we had timed it just right so that there weren't a lot of options for us to eat, but we managed. We stopped back through and talked with our travel guy, gave him our flight info and he noted to touch back with them the day before we were to leave (more on this later). Having read a lot of comments from other people, we had some expectations that I'm glad we were prepared for. Making reservations for dinner being one. The resort must change how they do these because when we were there, we had to go to Don Julian between 10 and noon and we could make reservations for that evening and the next evening. We ate at Sir Edward and La Bodega. We really really like La Bodega. Sir Edward seemed kinda stuffy to us and it was rather empty. Don Julian was very good. We enjoyed getting up early enough in the morning before the big crowd showed, eating breakfast, then going down to the beach. We slept in later one morning and couldn't believe how many people we saw at breakfast. So we really like getting up early when it was quiet. The desserts were lacking I thought, but I've found that to be true all around Mexico. The chocolate fountain was a bit of a disappointment, but that is the way of the area. I was surprised to see that the last few days Don Julian ran out of pineapple which I love and had at every meal. The nacho cheese was awful and the butter had a funny taste - but that could be the American in me. One tip we will NEVER forget is to bring your own insulated mugs. People were so jealous to see us on the beach with these and we were SO glad we brought them. The glasses the resort provides on the beach are so small and get hot so quickly. I had a soda with ice in mine for nearly 3 hours and it never got hot. In previous travels, the bartendars are usually very outgoing, but I didn't see that here. If we ordered drinks, it seemed like a different person brought them to us each time. So we couldn't really personalize with any one of them. They didn't speak to you much anyways. Another tip was about the smell of the room. I assumed there wasn't anything the resort could do about the smell, but I'm a huge smell person so I brought my own air freshener. It didn't really do a whole lot since the rooms are pretty big, simply opening the patio door was suffice to rid of the musty scent. I was disappointed after leaving a couple dollars every day for our maid, we never got any fun towel art or anything until the day before we were to leave. Maybe they needed a bigger tip? :) Our room was located on the side facing the hotel being renovated. You could count on them beginning work no later than 7 a.m. Fortunately we were usually up by then, but for those that want to sleep in, this could have been an issue. Also, we had to be careful about walking around unexposed as workers could plainly see into our room and they were not that far away. Overall though, we weren't picky about it so we didn't request a new room at all. We did do a trip to Chichen Itza which was really neat. I've had several opportunities to go, but never did until now. It was about a 3 hour trip on a bus, on a gravel road with speed bumps! Made us feel like we were in the back country. Our tour guide was excellent - it was difficult to stay with him though as he had to repeat everything in two languages. I highly recommend this excursion to anyone. And plan on spending the whole day there and not much else. We were exhausted when we got back. Overall, this was a fantastic place. I was surely impressed by it. The value for the money is very good. You can't even compare the beauty of any of the resorts nearby to this one - and the price is only a tiny bit higher. The food was decent and the rooms were as expected. I would love to come back someday but my husband is one that likes to change things up. One thing is for certain, Riu Palace has set a VERY high bar for the others we end up visiting in the future. Our biggest complaint was on the return back to the airport which is by no means the fault of the Riu. The day before we were to leave, we got a call from the travel group asking why we hadn't come to talk to them about our return. I informed the gentleman that the man we talked to upon our arrival took all our information and asked us to stop back the day before our departure sometime. He asked who it was I talked to and I honestly couldn't remember. He asked for a description - well, dark hair, dark skin...that doesn't tell them much :). The gentleman on the phone seemed very worried about it, but I just told him we'd be down to talk with them in a little bit. So we went down to the lobby and there were several men waiting to talk to us. None of which were who we recognized from earlier that week. They kept asking us to describe who we talked to like that person was a criminal or something. All we cared about was getting our transportation arranged. They asked us to fill out a customer complaint form detailing the incident, describing the person we talked to earlier in the week, etc. They indicated this was to help them better organize so as not to happen again. Fine - great - we'll see you tomorrow when we need a ride to the airport. The next morning, we came down to check out and were waiting in the lobby to leave. My husband went over to the same people we had talked to the day before and they didn't know who he was and they didn't see a reservation for us to get a ride back. WHAT?! After everything we'd gone through the day before, filling out that form so that \"it didn't happen again\" - and here it does happen again. There was another group waiting in the lobby to leave and they apparently had an earlier flight then us, except that there were two men who showed up unexpectedly and I'm thinking they took our spots. For whatever reason, they didn't leave for 45 minutes, as we're continuing to wait for a ride. We found out that the large group's plane reservation had changed and had a later flight than ours. We checked in again with the travel group and they said they had a guy coming to get us but he was stuck in traffic in Playa. Finally he arrive (nearly an hour after we were supposed to have left). I think the drive normally takes about 45 minutes but we got there in under 30. The speedometer on the car was broken, otherwise I could tell you how fast he must have going!

The check-in at the Riu was quick and easy, and the welcome drink was fabulous. Manuel is the main doorkeeper and is really fabulous. Our favorite employee by far was Regalio. He is the bar manager and couldn't be nicer. If you go, please give Regalio a \"hello\" from his mamasita from Minnesota. The Riu beach is lovely, and the rooms are great. We had no problem with using the water in the room to brush teeth, etc. The patios are beautiful. Our room was pretty quiet and cleaned well every day. There is turn-down service every night. The Riu is also an easy walk to a small, lovely shopping area as well as the bus that takes one on tours. I would definetly recommend the snorkeling. I don't think it's worth a trip to downtown Playa for shopping, but it's kind of fun to walk around. We had seven in our party, ranging in age from 15 to 86, and everyone had an equally good time. My teenage son was never bored and reluctant to go home after 7 days. The Cancun airport is pretty hectic, at least on Saturday morning.

There won't be much shade available on the beach until the palm leaves grow back, but there are now a couple of \"ocean-view\" rooms. The Riu Palace is still among the cleanest and best maintained resorts we've visited. They have a great staff, we recognized several from our stay 1 1/2 yrs ago. We were even remembered at check in by one of the front desk staff. The staffers here are very friendly. We ate every meal at the buffet. It was much more than acceptable, even for some of the more \"picky\" in our 5-person family. Bar service was excellent, you want something stronger, just ask. One bartender at the pool bar didn't seem to be enjoying himself, but it didn't affect his service. They have an excellent watersports group. The on site dive operator, Scuba Caribe, was excellent. We went out on schedule even on the day there were only two divers! Saw several sharks, tons of turtles, moray eels and other fish as well as some very colorful coral. We especially like the open courtyard full of tables and a stage. We would sit there every evening after dinner enjoying a nightcap, listening to the live bands on stage, people-watching and waiting for the indoor entertainment to begin.

Edwardo in the restaraunt at dinner time was the best. He always had a table ready for us with our drinks and he always took good care of us. The cleaning staff left a different towel creature every day. I don't know if they do this for everyone or if it is just for the guests with children. The towel arrangements were a lot of fun. Lots of drinks, never a moment when someone wasn't asking if you would like a drink. We enjoyed going over to the yucatan pools (bigger and more kids there than at the palace), however, very nice to come back to our quieter resort.

We stayed for 7 nights (and got married) at the Aventura Spa Palace prior to our 3 night stay at the RIU Palace Mexico. Had we stayed at the RIU for the entire trip, it's very possible that I would have rated it Excellent rather than the Above Average that I actually did rate it. That said, here is a breakdown of the trip: CHECK IN: The first thing that we noticed was the beautiful lobby as we entered. It was enormous and was decorated for Christmas. The Check In process was very simple. We were greeted with a glass of punch as soon as we entered (very good stuff) and went directly to check in. The reception desk folks were very polite and courteous and we were assigned our room within a matter of minutes. The gentleman provided us with a map of the resort as well as explained the times that we would need to make reservations at the ala carte restaurants. The only issue we had at check in was minor, but worth mentioning. We arrived at the RIU at about 12:30pm. We were told that we could not make reservations for the evening for ANY of the restaurants because they were already all booked, we would need to eat that evening at the buffet and that we could make reservations the next morning for dinner that evening. Reservations for dinner are taken ONLY between 8:30 and 10:30am each morning in front of the restaurants. It makes in inconvenient to arrive for a 3 night stay and not be able to eat at one of the ala carte restaurants the evening of your arrival. This left only two evenings to eat at the 4 ala carte restaurants. I'm not sure how the situation could have been avoided, but it seemed that maybe the hotel should hold several reservations aside in case guests that are checking in later in the day wished to eat something other than the buffet that evening. More on this later. Besides this minor issue, the check in process went very smoothly. B+ (only due to the reservation issue) ROOMS: The room we were assigned was in the courtyard area closest to the pool. We were in room 1049 which is actually a second floor room. The rooms were pretty large and contained a separate sitting area with a couch, coffee table and television. The rooms were also decorated nicely and each had it's own balcony or terrace. The bathroom sink area was large, but the toilet and bidet area were quite cramped. The bathtub was pretty standard with a shower head and was the same size that you have at home. This was one big difference between this and other resorts in Mexico that we've stayed before. The bath and shower areas at the RIU were MUCH smaller than those of other resorts that we've stayed. Not too big of a deal, just worth noting. We had three concerns with the room. The first night we were there, our TV would function properly, then the sound would go out for 20 or 30 minutes. It would come back on for a minute or two, then go out again. We called reception and they said they would send someone right up to check on it. Over an hour later, I called reception again and they advised me that the technician was nearby. He showed up just a few minutes later. When he came into the room, of course the TV was working properly. I explained to him what it was doing, but he spoke no English. He had to call to the front desk so that I could tell them what the situation was and they relayed the information to him. He handed me back the phone after speaking with reception and they told me that he was going to take care of another guest and return in 10 minutes to check on it. 10 minutes turned into another hour and I called reception again and asked them if we could just have another TV brought up. To their credit, within about 20 minutes, the same gentleman was there with another TV that had OK written on it in magic marker. Evidently this was not the first issue that they had with the TV's. He put the new one in and took the old one with him and he was on his way. Total time wasted waiting on the TV issue to be resolved: About 2 1/2 hours. Again not a huge deal, could have happened to anybody, certainly worth noting though. The other issue was with the air in our room. The terrace doors are designed with sensors to detect when they are open thus cutting off the air in the room. I totally agree with this. Why waste power when the doors are open? The problem was that evidently our sensors only worked part of the time. We had the door closed for several hours and it was still way over 80 in the room. We called reception and they sent a technician up to check. He was able to resolve the issue in just a few minutes. The sensors were not meeting correctly and I guess he fiddled with them enough to where it was able to work properly. We were very appreciative. The last concern that we had was the unavailability of an ironing board and iron in the room. We called reception to find out if we simply overlooked it somewhere and they advised that they would deliver one to us for a maximum of 30 minutes before they would come back to retrieve it. I don't know that I've ever stayed in a hotel room that didn't have an ironing board and an iron in it before. When it was delivered, I was amazed. The board was one of those 2 foot long travel boards with two hinges on the bottom to sit on a table top. The iron looked like it was several years old. It worked well enough but it was inconvenient to have to wait on it to be brought up and then only have 30 minutes of use. Other than those minor issues, the rooms were OK. C+ GROUNDS: I can't say enough about the grounds on the resort. AWESOME. It was a beautiful, beautiful resort. The grounds were immaculate. This is probably the best looking resort that we have ever stayed before. The courtyard with the fountains was very nice as were the pool areas. This was definitely top notch. A+ BEACH: Again, AWESOME. This was the biggest beach at a Mexican resort that I've ever seen. It was very nice, always had chairs to lay out on, had plenty of trees to offer shade and generally was pretty packed with people. A+ FOOD: Overall, the food was above average for an all inclusive resort. We at the buffet (Don Julian) for breakfast and it was pretty good. It had a pretty decent selection of food including a cold cereal bar and a fresh juice station. The lunch buffets were OK. The beef is not USDA, but was not too bad. Everything generally is overcooked, but I guess that's better then the alternative. We ate at two of the ala carte restaurants. La Bodega is a Brazilian restaurant that was pretty good. You must make reservations for this restaurant. On the subject of reservations, the night we ate here, there were about 15 of the 20 tables unoccupied. The restaurant is pretty small, but I couldn't understand why we were told when we checked in that we couldn't get a reservation at any of the restaurants. I suppose we should have gone down and checked at the restaurant ourselves on the first night, but we decided to just go into Playa and have dinner at La Parilla. The food is bought out Brazilian gaucho style on a large skewer and you advise the waiter how much you want. You have choices between chicken wings, pork tenderloin, sausages, skirt steak, sirloin steak (more like roast beef) and one other that I've forgotten. You have an unlimited salad bar and the service was very good. The second evening we ate at the Sir Edward gourmet restaurant. It was excellent. The steak was great, the shrimp and scallops were awesome and the service was good. This is also a small restaurant but there were many empty tables here as well which made us wonder if the restaurants were really booked up when we arrived. Overall the food was pretty decent. B+ ROOM SERVICE: None available. D+ (only because RIU advertised 24 hour snacks and beverages. We can get the beverages in the room, but what about the snacks? I also now notice that the 24 hour all inclusive icon for this property on the RIU website has been changed to just all inclusive and dropped the 24 hour part.) MAID and MINI BAR SERVICE: The maid did an excellent job with our room. It was always clean upon our return and we only came up once while she was in there and we only had to wait for her to leave for just a minute or so. The mini bar was stocked when we arrived with soft drinks, water and Corona beer. The service was to be restocked every other day and as necessary. We had it stocked each of the days we were there. The in room liquor dispenser was pretty standard. Bacardi Rum, Jose Cuervo Gold Tequila, Presidente Scotch and some type of Scotch Whiskey. We used very little and drank mostly at the Lobby Bar and the Pool Bar. A POOL: The pool area is very nice and relaxing. There were always plenty of chairs and the swim up bar was always nice to hang out at. Raul was excellent and not only worked at the Pool Bar but in the Lobby Bar as well. Some of the other bartenders were not nearly as cordial and engaging as Raul, but were OK overall. A BARS and DRINKS: The bars were all very nice. The Lobby Bar especially was great. There was a section that had a piano bar in it as well as an Internet cafe. It was very laid back and relaxing there, yet had kind of a formal feeling to it. I wouldn't hang out in the Lobby Bar in just shorts and a t-shirt. The Bartenders at each of the bars did an adequate job and attempted to accommodate most every request. The selection of liquors were great!. There was a wide variety of Bourbons and Whiskeys as well as Rum, Tequila and Vodka. There was also a great selection of cordials as well. Mostly premium stuff. A+ OVERALL EXPERIENCE: As I said in the beginning of the review, had we stayed here for the entire trip, we probably would have rated it even higher. We were spoiled by the Aventura Spa Palace. The RIU has almost a stuffy kind of atmosphere. There was a noise policy after 11 pm. No noise at all to be heard. Everything was basically shut down at that point. There is a disco at the RIU Tequila next door (we didn't go) and it was pumping throughout the night (we should have gone). The employees at the resort that we came into contact with would only speak when they were spoken to or if we acknowledged them first with a nod or something. It didn't seem like they went out of their way to be personable to the guests. I'm definitely not saying the service was bad, but it was not what I expected. The RIU Palace is a beautiful resort with a beautiful beach, decent food and OK service. If this property could provide the same level of customer service as some other resorts, it would be extremely highly rated. I would definitely recommended staying at this resort if you are interested in a great looking resort with a great beach. We would definitely return to a different RIU property, but probably not this one.

A word of caution about the flight. We used Aero Mexico. Our departure was delayed for 65 minutes leaving Boston and 3 hours and 15 minutes leaving Cancun with no explanation in either case. Also, Cancun airport is not a world class international airport. It actually borders on controlled chaos in our opinion. Priority check-in is meaningless here.

The lobby is beautiful and service is exceptional. Especially Stephanie and a petit small blond who wore a CSI T-shirt after the Hurricane hit. The staff was extremely polite. I found the room perfect, yes the mattress was hard but corrected with the mattress pad. Loved the bathroom. The room did smell a little musty, but hey once you open the patio doors it clears in a few minutes. Please remember, you are staying close to the ocean. I was a little disappointed that they did not offer room service (for food). On days we had full day excursions, we did not feel like dressing in the required casual attire for dinner. I do suggest a limited menu, i.e. sandwiches, fruit platter etc. The view from our room was spectacular, we stayed facing the fountains and the beach was everything I wanted and more. Now for the OK part of the trip, if you wanted to try the other restaurants you had to make reservations which was fine. However, it was only done at a specific time and it was handled by only one person, needless to say the line was very, very long; so I did not have the opportunity. The Apple Vacations representative was very patient during the difficult days post Wilma, some people were verbally aggressive and demanded immediate answers. We were at first told we would not be able to leave until the 26th or 27th but my prayers were answered and we were able to leave on the 25th. I could not believe she came looking for us personally to deliver the news. Now that is service! Now for another only OK part, we had to double up with another couple in preparation for the Hurricane, the first room we went to the individual was rude and refused to let us in. He slammed the door in my face. When I informed the staff, we were changed immediately. Also travel representatives from Belgium met us in the lobby and apologized profusely. They assured us his behavior was not indicative of their country. So I can honestly say the hotel does care about your confort level. We ended up sharing a night with a wonderful French Canadian couple. I did meet two other couples from England who were extremely pleasant. I just thought a smile was a uniform way to communicate. If nothing else to warrant a nod of acknowledgment. While most of the other Americans would reciprocate, I found the Europeans would not. At times while at the Buffet, some would rush in front, grab the serving utensil and act as if you weren't there. During one of the Hurricane meals two young women were ahead of me and they literally removed all but two tea sandwiches from the recently refreshed platter. While using the phone in the small shopping plaza across the street, the connection was lost after a minute. I put the receiver back on the hook and the individual behind me reached over my shoulder and picked up the receiver. She did not wait to see if I was going to try again or let me move two inches. Since she did not speak english, I gave her a look that obviously revealed my displeasure, she put the phone back. I am an African American, so this sort of behavior was especially disheartening as we could tell it had to do with our ethnicity. But overall we did not allow a few bad apples to spoil our fun. The hotel cannot be liable for guest behavior. There is no shortage of idiots. The final OK part is the hotel was charging individuals who stayed after their scheduled departure dates, despite the fact the airport was closed and even if it were open the road was impassable. This I could not understand, as from 10/20 to 10/21 I roomed with another couple. When they returned to their previous room I cleaned, removed the trash, swept the floor, obtained disinfectant and cleaned the bathroom. We had no phone service and the lights were out from Thursday night until Sunday evening. And you know, I would not have cared as others at different hotels did not fair as well but an additional $$$ burden did annoy my sense of reason. There were a lot of unhappy guests at checkout time.

Here is a breakdown of our review of the resort: Location - Great location. About a 30 minute stroll into Playa del Carmen or a 5 minute taxi. Easily accessible to the tourist areas of Tulum, Xcaret, Xel-ha, etc. Structure - Riu Palace's are probably the best designed resorts in Mexico. Elegant lobby, great \"piazza\" feel with live music in the evenings, wonderful fountains, nice pools, and everything is very clean. Keep in mind, that my visit was the week after Wilma and I felt this way....it will only get better. (As an FYI, the Riu Palace Riviera Maya being built about 5 blocks north is looking even nicer although it wasn't finished when we walked around...incredible looking) Beach - The beach at Riu Palace Mexico is nice for the area. Plenty of large palms to provide shade, umbrellas on the beach if you need them. Didn't look like much damage from Wilma. If you haven't been to the Riviera Maya, please be aware that the water off the beach is not crystal clear like other areas of the Caribbean. Also, it it is not as calm. Food - The food at the resort was above average for an all-inclusive in Mexico but did not meet my 5-star expectations. The buffet was above average for breakfast and lunch, but after a couple of times there, it got boring quick as the variety did not change enough. Plenty of options however and some very good meals were had....just not 5 star, more 4 store in total. Entertainment - Live music in the Piazza was great and we saw a couple of shows after the resort started to fill up again. Average in total, especially since little was available after about 11 pm each night. Service - 4 star service. Some really great employees including the gentleman who checked us in. Others were not interested in going out of their way to provide exceptional service. Rooms - we had rooms 245 and 246, oceanview. Due to the location of the resort, being farther away from the beach, I do not believe that oceanview is worth the extra money. Fountain view rooms on the side, would be my top choice for they are closer to the main lobby and restaurants, especially since there is no room service at the resort. Other items of note (nit-picky) - 1) Towel cards, key & wristbands - I hate the fact that this resort forces people to carry towel cards and wristbands around. They are truely awful and are not appropriate for a resort that wishes to be 5-star. Also, they need to get electronic door locks, since carrying around their key is also a pain. Other 5 star resorts like Secrets have gone away from both and use your name and room number as ID at the restaurants. 2) Internet access - in the age of cheap internet, this resort has yet understood. Only available for rental and not cheap at that. Yes, I know some people want to get away from it all....I believe they can choose not to use it, but people who need affordable internet access have to walk into PDC to get it. 3) Bar service at the buffet - difficult getting bar drinks at more busy times...are people less likely to want a drink just because it is a buffet meal? 4) Bar service at the beach - not available during our stay Please feel free if you want some of the pics we took during our stay or if you have any questions about this or the other resorts we have been to.

After reading many reviews about the Rui Palace, we were not surprised by the musty rooms and hard beds. Now that I got that out of the way... ... The Rui Palace was very nice. The PALACE is in Playacar which is a five minute cab ride to Playa Del Carmen's 5th avenue for all of you shoppers out there. More on that later. The Rui Palace is surrounded by 3 other RUI Resorts all of which are in walking distance. The Palace IS INDEED THE FINEST of them all. Thought I should mention this just in case you get overbooked and they want to put you at another Rui location... Don't. Insist on the Palace. The Palace features probably one of the nicest beaches I've ever seen in Mexico... many other people will tell you the same. The atmostphere is more adult-laidback even though kids are welcome, the clientelle seems to be more upscale here than the other RUIs (which could be good or bad depending on what you're after). The service\\waitstaff is top-notch. I cannot say enough on how friendly these people are. The only negative thing I could bring up would be the whole dinner reservations thing. The RIU sports 4 different resturants, however, 3 require reservations for dinner. Man, I'm on vacation, I've left my organizer at home, WTF, reservations?!? Oh well, no biggie... just make sure that you are at the reservations desk (yep, I said DESK) before 10am if you want to try any of the 3 resturants. If you're going through Apple Vacations, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the snorkling excursion. Make sure it's through Mayan Adventures! Seriously, this excursion rawked. We spent 3/4 day snorkling at 3 different places and ended-up swimming with a seaturtle, which made my wife's whole vacation. Lastly... Playa Del Carmen. The wife likes to shop so we try to get down to 5th Avenue and find deals. Before this vacation, it had been two years since being in Playa. Soooo much has changed in downtown Playa. Before, Playa was REALLY rough which kinda had an element of danger. However, present day, Playa has cleaned-up a TON! More street lights, they finished the main road downtown, we actually saw policemen patrolling, and it was really fun hanging out at Carlos and Charlies. I don't normally give anywhere 5 stars but the Riu Palace was pretty darn close (if our room hadn't have been musty). Hope this review helps...

Sand was HOT HOT HOT but that was because we were there in May. You NEED to rinse your suit off when you get out at that time of year due to some alge bug \"which I caught\" called sea lice. Sounds worse than it is. Its not lice but that is the name of it. In all areas of bikini I had oversized mesquito bite type bumps that itched like hell but if you show the girls in the pharmacy they know right what to do.(only use cream.

They are on top of things and everyone is very friendly and accomodating. The only problem I had was the morning I ordered room service (coffee only), they brought me a cold pot of coffee. When I called to ask for another one, it never arrived so I finally went down and got my own. Rooms - the rooms are nice but ours did have a musty smell to it. The beds are a bit hard and although we didn't get a mattress pad, I highly suggest it. You can't really cuddle because of the crack in between the beds. The TV's are definitely small and only a few selections of English speaking channels. I also didn't like that they do not have coffee pots in the room. I am the kind of person that doesn't like getting dressed to get a cup of coffee. Pool - we spent a lot of time at the pool and found it to be very clean by the pool bar. The other side wasn't so great - the water was filthy most of the time. They play great music during the day, too. Beach - Absolutely gorgeous. I would suggest getting there early if you like to sit up front right by the ocean. Otherwise, they have plenty of chairs and lots of palm trees for those who like the shade. Restaurants - the main buffett was decent. They had a huge spread of food but most of it was things that I have never even heard of nor had any interest in trying. Some of the American food they did have was a bit bland. My favorite was breakfast because you can't go wrong with sausage, bacon & french toast! We at twice at Sir Edward. We loved the appetizers and dessert. I had the filet mignon for the main course and it wasn't that great. My husband had the red snapper and that was much better.

The waitstaff anticipates your needs before you do and takes care of them immediately. The moment you are clearly done w/your plate, it is removed and your water glass is never allowed to be emptied. The rooms were very nice. Only issue we had was the beds are 2 doubles pushed together, so each person has to be on either side of the crack. We did not get a mattress pad, which may have solved this problem. Even though the beds are harder than we are used to, we were very comfortable sleeping on them. The rooms have the mini bar stocked w/soda, water & Corona, as well as a few bottles of liquor. The pool and beach areas were great. The grounds were absolutely beautiful - again much nicer than the other 2 Riu's we visited next door & across the street. We walked up & down the beach and the Riu Palace had the nicest beach by far. If the pool area gets filled, which it did a couple of afternoons, there is always plenty of room at the beach or take a short walk next door to the Riu Yucatan and hang out at their pool. Great thing about exchange privileges! The food was fantastic at most of the places we went for dinner. Our only complaint was you can only sign up for the restaurants needing reservations up to a day ahead of time starting at 10 am. The line forms well before 10 and by the time we made it up to our turn (We got in line at 10:10), there was only 1 place left for dinner that night & 1 for the next night. We did several tours which left before 10 am so a few nights, we had no choice but to eat at Don Julian, where you don't need reservation. All the restaurants require men to wear pants. We were not told this by our travel agent, so my husband wore the same pair of jeans every night for a week. They do not budge on this rule AT ALL (we tried!). Only dinner we felt was ok was at El Patio. I had the steak, which I like rare. It was beyond medium and really thin. The salad bar, soup & dessert were good there and my husband enjoyed the ribs. Don Julian was actually our favorite and the selection there for breakfast, lunch and dinner is amazing! You name it, they have it, no matter what part of the world you are from. Although we did not eat there, we heard Miyagi and Sir Edward were great. This resort is definitely good for a more laid back vacation. The crowd is older and more mellow. Only a handful of kids running around. We enjoyed this being that it was our honeymoon. We did go across to the Riu Tequila one night and that was definitely more a party atmosphere! Again, great having exchange privileges but you can always go back to the easygoing place! We did watch a couple of the shows - the Michael Jackson one being the best!

As soon as we arrived at the Palace we were given our rooms within 10 minutes, we had requested courtyard view, but unfortuneately our request was not made. Not a big deal! My mom who requires a wheelchair which was given and also a handicapped room. The staff is terrific and they met all our needs. The one bad thing for my mom was that there where no steps in the pool area only ladders, which is difficult for her. Also, there should be a walkway made for wheelchair accessibility to and from the beach (Somewhere on the side) that would be very convenient for people who require wheel chairs. My mom could not walk to and from the beach, thus she mostly stayed at the pool area, again which was fine with her. As usual the rooms did have a musty smell and when I got home I did do laundry to get rid of the musty oder, again which is not a big deal. It's an outdoor area in Mexico with temperatures in the 90's and it does tend to get humid and thus causing the smell in the rooms. The beds were perfect for us and they provided a crib for the baby. This time around there were a lot of people with kids and they did provide entertainment for the little ones prior to their shows every night at around 8:30. The shows were alright and we did enjoy the ones especially when they did the Mr. and Ms. Riu Palace contests which were a lot of fun. Food was good. The buffet is the best place for breakfest and dinner, it has a wide variety of foods for I think every pallet. For kids they served pizza, burgers, french fries, hot dogs, lots of ice cream choices, my daughter was in heaven. We did go to the Japanese restaurant one night and it was alright, nothing special and we did prefer to eat at the buffet rather than all the other restaurants.

The pool is not THAT impressive, but nice. The gym is so-so, but you probably wont spend too much time there anyway. Entertainment was just ok, the shows are kinda cheesy. I guess my idea of entertainment is not watching a half-assed michael jackson impersonator. We went out to Playa del Carmen for entertainment, we liked the Blue Parrot. Good music, fire dancers right on the beach at 11pm, $5 entery gets you 2 beers or 1 mixed drink. There are also many up-scale bars and lounges, very west hollywood style for those people from Los Angeles. Speaking of entertainment, there were no adult channels on the television, but thats ok because we could hear the couple next door having sex!! :)~ I had read a review that commented about noises in the rooms. This was very true in our case. From about 9-10 am to 7pm there was constant noise in our room from the outside. We heard the \"furniture being dragged\" from upstairs and it was very annoying on the days we had partied late the night before and wanted slept in past 9. I had read about the \"amazing service\" in the reviews before, so I was expecting a lot. While the service is good I have a few complaints. I had to call 4-5 times for a mattress pad. When it was finally delivered, we found it is was just a bed cover placed underneath the sheets. Also, when you request the beds be joined there are still two seperate sets of sheets on the bed. This makes it very hard to snuggle since you cant really share the sheets and the two sets dont stay together. I had tipped the maids the first two nights and really wasnt satisfied with how the room was cleaned(no towel art may I add), so tipping the maids stopped after the second night. I am also a little suspicious about who else has the key to the safe box. The service in the buffet was really dependant on the server. There are no assigned seats or times anymore, so sometimes we would get a great server (I'd tip $2-5 depending on the service) and sometimes my glass would stay empty for 10 minutes before somebody would come to fill it (wouldnt leave a tip for that waiter). But I must say I thought the food was pretty darn good for a buffet! Loved the breakfast, loved the seafood pastas at dinner. We tried two ala carte resturants, miyagi's (japanese) and el patio (steakhouse). I thought the steakhouse was pretty good, we both had the ribeye, although the dessert and salad was still buffet. style The set-up of the japanese was excellent, but i thought the food was average/below average compared to the sushi bars in the los angeles area. The fried ice cream was awesome! My fiance got sick after the sushi night, but that might have been from the 5-6 bottles of sake we were downing with the food. she thinks it was from the shrimp since she ate it all. btw, corona really doesnt go with sushi imo, wish they had some japanese beer. oh well. Dont expect to get drunk on mixed drinks. They are pretty weak and asking for a double doesnt change much. I couldnt really tell if there was alcohol in them at all. I didnt use the alcohol dispensor in the room, but i suppose i could have gotten drunk if i really wanted by taking shots in the room. Smirnoff and Cuervo..yuk. There was Absolute at the main bar, but i usually just headed to PDC. I had read in a review that food couldn't be taken to the room from the buffet. Not true! at 10am we went and brought a bunch of plates of breakfast to the room. I dont know why a previous poster had to \"smuggle\" anything. kinda funny in retrospect. Oh, beware of the mosquitos! My fiance spent an hour the first day killing mosquitos in our room. We still got biten up. In regards to the bathroom, it was a little dark in the shower when the curtain was closed, but not a big deal. The towels are pretty nasty (partly why I was dismayed with the maid service). They were thin and old with stains. This was also true for the towel service at the pool. Let me just close by saying again that the beach was AWESOME. Plenty of lounge chairs at all times. The beach makes this resort. One more thing, if you decide on going scuba diving be warned about your ears!! nobody tells you this, but you will likely have some major ear pains for 12 hours afterwards, so save it for the end of your trip. Oh yeah, Xcaret, thumbs down. Dont waste your day and visit the zoo when you get home. And about Cozumel, plan on renting a car to explore the island or else you will be walking around the tourist shops. I probably wouldn't go back to this resort, only because there are other nice places to visit around that area i would like to try. But if you havent been there before, go and enjoy.

We chose the Palace based on Trip Advisor reviews. It was like a dream!!! The people, the service, the location, the grounds, the beach, the rooms, and of course, the value was far more than what we expected. AIRPORT TRANSFER - we booked through Apple Vacations. Arrival into the Cancun airport was very smooth. Representatives were waiting for us outside the baggage claim area very well identified. 45 minutes ride to the Riu. In the way to the hotel the shuttle showed us a video of excursions with Apple in the Riviera Maya. But you will save a lot of $$ and time by renting your own car and buying tickets at the sites. (instead of paying $160 for 2 adults to Tulum you can do that plus Cancun with less than $100) CHECK IN - very smooth, they welcomed us by sitting us on a table, gave us a cold drink and explained to us about the hotel. We arrived at 2PM and the rooms were not ready. We were told to come back at 4pm, so we spent about 2 hours eating and exploring the hotel and the beach, exactly what we wanted. Remember to ask for towel cards, they forgot to give them to us at check in and we had to walk from the pool back to the front desk. ROOMS- we were on room 0015 (first floor facing south to the trees). A lot of privacy, specially if you want to be on the balcony. Very spacious rooms, almost 1/2 bigger that the standard US rooms. Based on previous reviews we requested a matress pad by e-mail which turned out to be a great help. Bathroom is very spacious, we had plenty of light in the shower, so definitely wasn't dark as we have read on some reviews. Mini bar with drinks including Coronas at no charge. FOOD- excellent!!! loved Don Julian and La Bodega. No reservation needed for El Patio and La Traviata. But for dinner need to reserve Don Julian, La Bodega (our favorite), and Sir Edwards (specially the last two b/c they are smaller and fill up quickly-reserve them by 8am, although 10am is the latest you can reserve) . Need to reserve Don Julian by 10am as well, but if you don't, chances are that there will be seating available for the 9pm turn. POOL -very spacious and beautiful. The pool bar closes at 5pm. You have until 6pm to return the towels, otherwise will need to take them to your room and return them the next day by the pool. We loved the jacuzzis at the spa, there are two, one is warmer than the other and it closes at 7pm. BEACH - I have been in cancun, cabo san lucas, and puerto vallarta and this is by far the most beautiful beach I have been in Mx. Soft sand, crystal clear water, warm temperature, no rocks. Somedays it was calm, other days with some wave action, not enough to be dangerous but great to have a lot of fun. Great for romantic long walks. They bring you drinks to your beach chair. Never had a problem finding chairs even when we got there at 11am. SERVICE - we were always joking and asking ourselves, what pill do they get in order to have a smile in their faces at all times?? No words will never describe how impressed we were with the service at the Riu Palace...the best ever!!!!! TULUM AND CANCUN - rented a car for $60 including insurance (from 10am to 10am). The front desk arranged it for us. In the morning we went to Tulum (about 45 minute drive to the south) and in the evening to Cancun (45 minutes to the north). The roads are very well identified, and never felt even confused nor lost. PLAYA DEL CARMEN - about 25 minute walking from the Riu, felt very safe walking since the hotel is on the Playacar gated complex. Once you get out of the complex you are in downtown PDC. Taxi is $4 each way. TIP- tip if you want, service will be outstanding even if you don't BRING.... insect repelent, sunblock (will really need it), and an open mind!!! There were not many children which helps a lot when you are in on honeymoon (although we love children). There are not a lot of activities for children. The Riu is the best hotel in the Playacar complex (although there are others more expensive, including the Royal Hideway which has lost its beach due to erosion, unfortunately) We believe in always discovering a new place, that's the only reason we don't plan to go back to the Palace. But I will highly recomended it if you are on a honeymoon, want to relax, and at the same time be close to a vibrant town like Playa del Carmen.

Food: We ate at 3 of the ala carte restaraunts sir Edwards,La Bodega,El Patio.As far as food taste it was average but presentation was nice also atmosphere was good.But we feel the food was better by far as well as variety at Don Julian buffet and La Traviata for lunch by the beach Service: the service was very good and everyone who worked there was polite especially Noe who was was a pleasure to see everyday around the pool.We asked for a mattress pad upon arrival and it was there in an hour.Nightlife:Not much nightlife as for as dancing.We went to the tequila to the disco around 10:30 pm on 2 nights the first night there was at best 7 people in there and kind of boring not much dancing going on.And the second night we went there was 15 or so children running around the bar with no adults present and Shark Tales was playing on the big screen TV so no dancing for us.There were shows every night and were Ok but a little cheesy.But we would eat a late supper have a couple drinks and in bed by 11:00pm Resort and Beach:As for the resort,it was beautiful and impressive,lots of marble and tile with a hint of a new orleans feel in the iron work the palm trees are already showing signs of new growth and the grounds are continually being replanted from Emily. The beach was very nice and cleaned every evening and beach chairs all reset in rows.The palm trees on the beach still have an average of 5 to 9 full fronds on them and offer ample shade from the sun.Believe me it was very hot upper 90's and we had rain in the forcast everyday but we didn't see a drop.As for sunscreen we brought bullfrog waterproof 30spf and got great tans with no burning and we applied it before we went out if you applied it after you started sweating it would just glob on and not absorb,just a tip.As for the bug problems we didn't use anything while we were there sand fleas in the evening on the sand bite a bit but a small bottle of witch hazel and good to go.I actually got bit by mosquitos worse when i came home and checked my garden for 5 min. than I did in mexico no bites in mexico.But if you go near the jungle area it's bad from others that did cenote and jungle tours I talked to.We went on a sunset cruise $70usd each it was nice you were on a tri-hulled catamaran w/16 other couples they served drinks and hor'dourves and cruised around the calm waters for 45 min trip and then to the beach for a steak or lobster dinner under the palms.Lets see what have I forgotten? Oh yeah,check in was a breeze about 2 min. heres your key sir. We stayed in room 1114 the rooms were extremely nice and very spacious we weren't feeling closterfobic a bit.There was safe in the room and I was wary about who else had a key but did not have a problem and used it the whole trip.We left tips out for the cleaning people and they wouldn't take the money unless I specifically wrote tip on a piece of paper adjacent to it.Iv'e never said hola(hello) so many times in my life the people are very friendly and a complement as well as $ goes a long way.If you are worried about hurricane damage DON'T unless you look hard you wouldn't no it.This is not the Ritz Carlton but it is a very nice place with very nice people.Would I go back again? I would probably not.Because of the lack of things to do in the evening my wife and I are both 38 and still like to go dancing.If you want a place to relax this it!

Before our vacation I lived on this board trying to read all the reviews, and I have to say that most of them are dead on, I thought all the positive ones were too good to be true, but they were not - its really an amazing resort! We visited Aug 1 - Aug 6th, just after hurricane Emily and besides a few bare palm tree's you'd have no idea that a hurricane had hit. The grounds were amazing, and so clean! The staff was so attentive and gracious. I've stayed at five star resorts before and often felt unwelcome, or that the staff was too snobby. However, every member of the staff at the Riu Palace has a smile on and is there to help. I don't speak Spanish, and I had no problems communicating in any way. In fact the resort does cater to more of a European cliental, (it is a Spanish chain) so English is abundant for any one who had concerns. The rooms were fantastic, and so well cleaned. I read a lot of complaints about a musty smell, hard beds and a dark shower. There is no musty smell , its called humidity and there isn't much you can do about it. Things just stay a little more damp so it might bother some people who live in dryer climates. The bed's are hard, we didn't order a mattress pad though and were able to sleep just fine. The shower does not have a light, it would be a plus to have one but it wasn't an issue at all - we could see just fine! As everyone else says the beach is amazing, its a real slice of paradise. We never had any issue getting a lounge chair under the palm trees, there is shade but because of hurricane Emily the palm trees are a little bare - they grow pretty fast so in a couple months it should be back to normal. The resort was at 100% occupancy when we were there and it never felt overcrowded. The pool also looked very nice and clean, we never touched it though - I mean you can swim in a pool anywhere, so we spent most of our time at the beach. The restaurants were great, and yes you can now make reservations from 10:00 - Noon in front of Don Julian's restaurant. Here is a tip that we didn't pick up on till the end, you can book for more than one night, in fact you can book dinner reservations for the whole stay. If you don't have reservations, not to worry, we thought that the buffet at Don Julian's was great! They have different theme nights, so the food does vary. We were really impressed with the variety of food they offered. Like I said before there selection did seem to cater towards Europeans, but there is was plenty of choices for traditional American food, and they also have a great authentic Mexican section in the corner. Breakfast was great and so was lunch. El Patio is another one of their buffets, we ate there for lunch a couple of times. Not as large of a selection, but good nonethe less. We didn't get sick either, and I have a super sensitive stomach. I even came with medicine expecting to get sick because I always do in Mexico. The water is non-potable so you need to remember to brush your teeth with bottled water (supplied in room) and not open your mouth in the shower. When people complain of getting sick there can be several reasons, most of it is probably due to over indulgence in food, drinks, etc. Or just not remembering to stay away from the tap water. All the water that is served at the restaurants and the ice is purified. So no issue there. The resort does cater to a more mature audience, and isn't a wild party place if that is what you are looking for. My husband and I are in our late 20's and had a great relaxing time. Every night after dinner they have some sort of entertainment, and it you want more you can always go to downtown PDC or across the street to the Riu Tequila. Its not a place for young, active kids, there isn't really much to do for them there. One last thing to point out to everyone is that you are in another country - so there will be differences in food and the culture, appreciate the differences and don't let it bother. It was really refreshing to be surrounded by so many other cultures and be in a place that was less Americanized then Cancun.

Our previous travels to the Riviera Maya are as follows: July 1997Allegro (Diamond Resort) in Playacar (no kids yet) February 1998Iberostar Tucan (no kids yet) June 2000Iberostar Quetzel (with 1 year old son) July 2003Sunscape Tulum p/k/a Allure (with son and 1.5 year old daughter) June 2004Palladium (with both kids) We look for a good combo of picturesque beach, grounds and pool, a good variety of food, and some name brand liquor for me. We decided to celebrate our 10th anniversary with a trip alone, leaving our 6 and 3 year-olds at home. It was very difficult to arrange a trip because (1) I just started a new job and have no accrued vacation and lots of work; and (2) we don\u2019t really have any willing and able family members to watch our children. The two living grandmas are elderly and can\u2019t really handle the kids for more than one day. We originally planned a 3-night trip to the Riu Yucatan for the first weekend it opened (July 8) but canceled because Hurricane Dennis was moving by and we were concerned we would have 3 days of wind and rain. We re-booked for the Gala Resort the following weekend (7/15) and canceled at the last minute as Hurricane Emily was approaching. At this point, my wife was of the opinion that this trip just wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. We decided to try one more time. Very few rooms were available anywhere because of many other travelers canceling and re-booking. We ultimately decided to spend a little more money and splurge on the Riu Palace. I know there has been a lot of Apple Vacation bashing because of the way its reps handled Hurricane Emily cancellations, evacuations, etc. I for one had no problems canceling and re-booking twice without penalty. We also re-booked the original trip once when the price went down $100 pp, all without problems. I did have to use 2 different travel agents because my regular agent, who operates a one-person shop, was actually in Playa with a large group just prior to Emily hitting. Our trip went off without a hitch. We ended up with a tag team of grandparents and one of our old babysitters watching our kids for the 3 nights we were gone. FLIGHT \u2013 USA 3000, 6:00 a.m. flight \u2013 Got aisle seats, took off and landed early and had a free movie if you wanted to watch (Madagascar (sp)). No complaints, other than the breakfast being pretty bad. Flight home, landed an hour early, watched some movie with Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher. It was stupid, but help pass the time. Again, an inedible meal, supposedly chicken teriyaki. ARRIVAL AT CUN AIRPORT \u2013 Immigration and customs were quick at 8:30 in the morning and were outside in a small van by about 9:00 a.m. TRANSFER \u2013 Had to wait awhile for van to be filled up and made two fairly quick stops at Secrets and Paradisus, and then a smooth ride to Playacar, by about 10:30. CHECK-IN \u2013 Quick and easy by a very attractive clerk who explained the reservation system, towel cards, safe locks, etc. while we sipped some Mango juice. In my opinon, the best thing about RIU Palace check-in is that the lobby has AC! Note that ala carte reservations are now available from 10:00 a.m. to noon and you can reserve for the next day. There is no line by 11:30 and there are some spots remaining. Also, at this time you do not need to select a dinner seating time and table for Don Julian. Show up whenever you want. Our room was not ready, but the clerk said it would be in about 45 minutes. Given our past experiences, we though that really meant about 2 hours. She told us we could still catch continental breakfast at one of the Beach restaurants. We had a nice breakfast consisting of more than the usual continental variety. There were eggs, bacon, hash browns, etc., as well as fresh juices and coffee. By the time we finished breakfast and had a drink at the lobby bar, (a little over an hour) our room was ready. As I walked up to the desk, 2 different clerks were calling my name and telling me our room was ready. ROOM - I requested a courtyard view, noting it was a special anniversary trip, but did not get one. Our view of the neighboring Viva Wyndam resort, which is heavily damaged, closed and undergoing heavy reconstruction. I was not happy, but did not complain. I later received a call from Stephanie in Public Relations apologizing for not being able to provide a courtyard view and asking if there was anything else they could do for us, such as reservations at one of the ala cartes. We already had a reservation at Sir Edwards, so I said \u201cno thanks.\u201d I thought the gesture was nice. We also received a call from the desk, simply asking if all of the room amenities were functioning. I also thought this was also a nice gesture. Everything worked fine. AC was super cold. No general musty smell in the room, but the couch smelled bad, as noted by another recent report\u2026kind of like musty body odor smell. We threw a towel over the couch to sit. The look and design of the room was by far the best we have had in the Playa area. Whoever decided to have a hallway entry with an extra heavy wooden door is a genius. He or she eliminated one of the most common complaints about Playa resorts\u2026hallway and outdoor noise from doors slamming and yelling. If you kept the inside door to the hallway shut, you could not hear anything in the hall. If you left it ajar, it was noisy. We also liked the room size and sunken living area\u2026but try to remember there is a step down, especially after a day of drinking. I also loved the mini bar. Drinks were cold and being able to enjoy a Smirnoff and tonic or a Bacardi and cola in my room was really nice. One slight complaint \u2013 none of the nearby ice machines were working, but I had the lobby bartender fill our ice bucket a couple times with no complaints. The water was hot and had great pressure and lighting was adequate. Maid service was also adequate\u2026only one towel animal, but who cares. I hope the Riu management is not reading this, but we took our towel animal home. Sorry, but it was the perfect souvenir for our 3-year old daughter. It was a pig (I think) and had little stick-on eyes . We tipped the maid $2 a day and also put $2 in the minibar the first day. It was stocked each of our two full days we were there. RESORT LAYOUT \u2013 We absolutely loved the layout and look of the resort. It truly looks like a palace. The lobby is breathtaking and the courtyard is very inviting and beautiful. You could hardly tell a hurricane had hit, with the exception of the missing palms and the large buoy washed up on the beach. The Riu is the perfect size for the number of guests staying there. It never seemed crowded at any of the bars, the pool or the beach. I think I now prefer the openness of the Riu Palace, as opposed to the natural jungle setting of resorts like the IB* and Palladium. I think it also makes for fewer insects in the evening. The other great thing about the Palace is that you can walk to the Lobby or to the beach/pool area without ever actually going outside the buildings. You can walk down the hallways, which are shaded and breezy. I really enjoyed this, as the heat is intense, especially when drinking and carrying all of your beach gear. BEACH \u2013 Incredible. The Riu built back far enough that, whatever erosion has occurred, there is still plenty of beach. Same white sand and beautiful water from previous trips, but a little murky, perhaps from the hurricane. Also, more seaweed than I remember, but still much nicer than the sand and water at the Sunscape Tulum and Palladium, in my opinion. The beach never seemed that crowded at the Palace, but the Riu Yucatan and some of the other Playa resorts were very crowded. The Palace actually has too many loungers on the beach. I would suggest that they stack about 50 or so off to the side and unstuck them only if a need arises. Shade is hard to come by with the palm trees being stripped, but this will remedy itself eventually. It would be nice to have some umbrellas or Palapas for shade. My wife prefers the sun and kept me out on the beach and in the sun most of each day. I was applying sunscreen non-stop and only the lower half of my face burned, which I attribute to lots of time in the water with the sun reflecting. The beach bar is a short walk and was staffed by Roy, the most friendly and efficient bartender we have ever encountered. He will remember your drink preference and will gladly fill a giant Bubba Keg with Corona or anything else you want, then comment \u201cSee you in 10 minutes.\u201d There was a bee problem at the resort and poor Roy was swatting them with sticky board throughout the day. Please tip Roy a few bucks. He does his job without complaint under extreme conditions of heat. The only beach deeper and wider than the RIU Palace is the GALA. I would say it has the best beach of the Playacar resorts. There are tons of loungers and still room for 2 beach volleyball courts, a beach soccer field and just plain open space. The IB* beach was also crowded and nowhere near as deep as when we stayed there. Going further down (south?), the Royal Hideaway beach is very small and the Allegro (closed for hurricane repairs) is extremely small. Quite frankly, the Allegro needs to be completely rebuilt, with pool area moved away from the beach. There cannot be more than 50 or 60 feet from the resort\u2019s flood wall to the water. POOL \u2013 The Riu Palace pool is not very impressive. It is really just two semi-circles around the pool bar areas. There is room to expand, either on the beach or in the middle area of the pool bar area, where there is seating that is never used (too hot). I think the Palace should consider adding a pool, maybe an adult-only right on the beach. We found the pools at all of the RIU\u2019s to be too small for the number of guests. However, to our surprise, the Palace pool was never that crowded. We only had trouble finding loungers on one occasion in the early afternoon. The towel game is played here, despite a posted rule prohibiting the reservation of chairs. There were kids, but they were pretty well-behaved, much better than ours would have been. The quiet side of the pool is just that\u2026quiet and relaxing. There is quick drink service around the pool and I alternated between the bar and using wait service. I tipped a few times, whenever I had some singles with me, but there is no pressure to tip. The pools at the Riu Playacar and Riu Yucatan were extremely crowded and noisy, with lots of kids. The Yucatan had lots of kids, loud music and shouting. We are very glad we did not end up staying at the Yucatan. I think what happens is that the Riu Tequila guests use the beach at the Yucatan and then end up hanging out at the Yucatan pool and pool bars, which makes for way too many people. We have stayed at the IB* twice and never had crowds like at the Yucatan. I am a pretty frugal person, but for the extra money it costs to stay at the Palace, it is well worth it for the lack of crowding. BARS \u2013 All stocked with premium liquor for the asking. You get no good stuff hidden under the bar or frowns when you ask for Absolut Vodka or Beefeater Gin. The bartenders are eager to give you a double and even ask most of the time. I got really toasted on Absolut on the rocks with a splash of lime juice the first full day we were there, which did not please my wife. I stuck to mostly beer the next day and paced myself. The drink menus are nice, especially for those that want tropical drinks, but don\u2019t\u2019 know what to ask for. My wife liked the Blue Corals and they tasted pretty much the same at all the bars. The lobby bar is air conditioned and a great place to hang out during the day or early evening. There are way too many smokers for my enjoyment as the evening progresses and it really smells of cigarette smoke late at night or early in the morning, when the AC is turned off. SERVICE \u2013 Incredible, no comparison to other resorts we have stayed. The service in the Don Julian Buffet was great. We never had to wait for someone to take our drink order and once taken, it was acted upon. I had a huge problem with the service in the Palladium buffet last year. It ranged from inconsistent to poor. There were often waiters standing around while we needed drinks, including morning coffee. We would have gladly served ourselves, but that was not an option. At the RIU, service at breakfast and dinner was perfect. I tipped our waiter Hernandez a couple bucks each night at Dinner. He never let my Champagne glass run dry and brought my wife a bottle of Pepsi faster than lightning. I also tipped the wait captain, who pretty much backed up Hernandez when it was busy. Even though you don\u2019t have to sit at the same table each night, I would encourage everyone to do so. It is nice to get the same waiter each night. The courtyard drink service in the evening is nothing short of spectacular. When you sit down someone will take your drink order within less than a minute. The waiters are literally racing around with drinks and checking on you. If you indicate that you are fine, a piece of paper is placed under your ash tray to indicate that the waiter checked on you. There seems to be a very structured head waiter/waiter/busboy system, where service standards almost too strict. For example, we saw a cocktail napkin fly off a waiters tray when he was moving fast through the courtyard. The head waiter/supervisor immediately picked it up and then gave a pretty menacing glance at the waiter, presumably for letting this happen. We thought \u201clighten up, we couldn\u2019t be happier with the service.\u201d FOOD \u2013 Last, but not least, for the most part we enjoyed the food. Food is a very personal and subjective subject. My wife is sort of picky and really not that interested in food on vacation, other than getting basic nutrition and having some good ice cream and desserts available. I love to eat, especially things that are not available at home. In Mexico, I love to eat Ceviche, smoked salmon, grilled fish, etc. The Palace did not disappoint either of us. My wife was very happy with the breakfasts, burgers and guac at lunch and, especially the ice cream bar at dinner. She also enjoyed fajitas at Dinner, which are available in the Mexican area each night. I actually enjoyed breakfast the least. They pretty much had the standard fare, but no Mexican items and no changes. The bacon and omlettes were fine, as were the many juices and smoothies available. I was surprised and disappointed that there was no smoked salmon at breakfast. Lunches were great at the La Traviata and El Patio. We preferred El Patio, but it closes just before 3:00 and only managed lunch there one of the 3 days, based on our late lunch schedule preference. Both restaurants have the standard hot dogs and hamburgers, but La Traviata also has pizza and pasta, neither of which appeal to me at lunch. El Patio has grilled and fried fish (fish tacos rock), along with Mexican dishes. Both restaurants have really good salad bars. My wife enjoyed a chicken Caesar salad one day and she is usually afraid to eat salad in Mexico. Given our short time at the Palace, we only ate 2 dinners at Don Julian, but enjoyed both very much. I could almost live off the salad bar\u2026smoked salmon, whole salmon, fresh tuna, deviled eggs with caviar, hearts of palm. I had a whole plate of cold items before I even checked out what else was available. The foot long homemade bread sticks go great with smoked salmon and capers. Each night they had Paella, one night with rice, the other with pasta. They always had grilled chicken breasts and beef steaks, as well as many potatos and vegetable casseroles. They had a carving station with roast beef and turkey, as well as freshly prepared pasta. There was not much cooked seafood, other than squid and what was in the Paella, but I suspect this changes if you are there 7 nights. There were many wine choice, but I stuck to Champagne at dinner. If you try to sample everything, you would probably get bored over a week\u2019s stay. If you eat something different each night, you should be fine. The ice cream buffet is awesome. 5 different flavors and every topping imaginable. There is a chocolate fountain where diners can dip marshmallows. It doesn\u2019t actually taste very good, but it is fun to watch people smile and use it. There is a more fudge-like chocolate topping for the ice cream. Prior to this, my favorite dinner buffet was at IB* Tucan/Quezel. The RIU Palace was similar and just slightly better. We ate at Sir Edwards our second evening and were not very impressed. The food is served banquet style. Everyone\u2019s appetizers are brought out at the same time, then salads, then entr\u00e9e, etc. I had some stomach issues, which I am blaming on the muscles Rockafeller(sp). My lamb was okay. Quite frankly, I was kind of toasted and my wife was upset with me on this evening, so it did impact our meal in a negative way. If we would have been in a better mood, we probably would have gone to the buffet for ice cream after this meal. ENTERTAINMENT \u2013 We only watched one dancing show. It was fairly brief and entertaining. Our last night they had a pretty good band playing in the courtyard from about 9 to 10, followed by the show and then another few songs. It would have been nice if the band had played until midnight, but I guess some guests might complain. There were quite a few older couples there who tended to go back to their rooms early. This is definitely not an evening party place, but you can cross the street to the Tequila for that. We checked out the disco, which was pretty much a teens and 20\u2019s crowd. Note that the walk from the Palace lobby to the disco at the Tequila is probably shorter than the walk from most Tequila guestrooms. Also, there is late night food available outside the Tequila, including fresh grilled burgers. OVERALL \u2013 This is by far the best resort we have stayed at to date. I highly recommend it. Other than the minor complaints noted herein, this was a nearly perfect experience. If we can afford it, we may return with our kids next Summer. I know it is not the most kid-friendly resort, but I think if we alternate between the Yucatan pool and Palace beach, our kids won\u2019t disturb the other guests too much. If too expensive, we may try the GALA next year, as its beach is definitely the best in Playacar. This site was, as always, very helpful in planning our trip. Be wary of extremely negative reviews and reviews where it is obvious that the traveler is not accustomed to staying in the particular region. Many of the things complained of (e.g. no ocean view rooms, only domestic beer) are pretty much standard for most resorts in this area and such information is commonly known and available if you do your research. Often, extremely negative reviews are the result of unpleasant surprises and isolated negative experiences. I always look for the trends and discount overly postive and negative reviews.", "Date": "August 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dayton, OHio", "Title": "\u201c5 Stars All The Way Around!!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3750745", "Content": "From the moment we arrived, we were pampered and treated like royalty.

We loved it and our group of 8 guests loved it as well. They raved about how it was the best vacation they had ever taken. Many of them have traveled to various resorts and taken cruises and they agreed that the Palace was exceptional. I really don't understand the negative reviews. I've read complaints about the TV stations, but when I'm on vacation, TV is one of the last things on my mind. I can watch it at home. Besides, there were plenty of English speaking channels and I have never stayed at a hotel in the states that offered an overabundance of translated channels for foreign guests. Also, there is a spa. The spa staff is wonderful. I had a wonderful body exfoliation. It is located near the pool. The front desk staff will direct you there. Myself and three other guests did get sick, but we attributed it to an overindulgence in alcohol and food. We all agreed not to let it get the best of us. We took some medication, stayed away from alcohol for a day or so, and we all felt great! The disco is not very far. It is right across the street at the Tequila (short walk). Seems to cater to a younger (high school/college) crowd, but it's nice to check out. If you are interested in more night life, catch a cab into the city. Food: The food is really good. Everyone in our group always found something they liked. One person didn't care too much for the food and ordered from Domino's, but they readily admitted that they were a picky eater. Don Julian's is open with a buffet for all meals. For breakfast, you can choose from eggs, fruits, juices, pancakes, french toast, sausage, bacon, cereal, breads, etc. I never ate lunch there. We ususally ate at El Patio (Mexican foods, chips/salsa) or La Traviata (pizza, lasagna, etc). They both have salad bars and have an open patio style. You could always find hamburgers, hot dogs, and french fries, too! At dinner we ate at Don Julian's some evenings. There was usually a theme such as seafood, martinis, chocolate fondue fountain, Mexican, etc. Again there was something for everyone. The desserts were OK, but we usually stuck to the ice cream sundae bar. The specialty restaurants were usually easy to make reservations for, plus it gave us an excuse to get up and get the day started. La Bodega is a wonderful Brazilian steakhouse that serves tender meats in a cool Brazilian setting. If you like Japanese food, Miyagi's has a nice upscale setting. I never ate at Sir Edward's, but one person in our group informed me that the lamb was wonderful. POOL: Nice size, always clean and at a comfortable temperature, and never overcrowded. BEACH: The staff cleans the beach every morning. The water is turquoise and feels wonderful. We were warned not to buy silver jewelry from the vendors on the beach. You can go into the city (5th ave) and find beautiful jewelry and other products (only a $5.00 cab ride). ROOM: Cleaned daily and the staff does a great job. We tipped every day and had some form of towel art each day. Others in our group didn't tip and they did not have any towel art. The fridge is stocked daily with Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, 7Up, bottled water, Corona, etc. The liquor dispenser is available. Some reviews have noted that there is nothing to mix with, but we assumed that we should use the beverages in the fridge and it worked out great. A bottle opener is supplied as well. The bathroom is a nice size. The water pressure in our second room was great. We were upgraded to a new room the day after we arrived. On the day of our wedding, the room was decorated with ballons and flowers. WEDDING: Beautiful place for a wedding. The coordinators were so helpful and they accommodate large and small weddings. GROUNDS: We arrived only a few days after Hurricane Emily hit. The place looked great. It was very clean. The flowers were down and some of the tops of the palm trees were a little bare, but hey, a hurricane had just hit. The things that RIU could control looked great. Last note: Our driver to the airport told us that the staff is only paid $5/day on average! Even though RIU tells you not to, we were so glad that we had tipped the maids, bartenders, wait staff, etc. They work much harder than what they are paid, if that's true. If you are considering this resort, I would strongly suggest that you visit!", "Date": "August 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Potomac, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cAnother amazing vacation in paradise\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3742155", "Content": "We stayed at the Riu Palace from July 29th to August 5th. We were two families 9 people in total. This was our second time returning for our family and a first time for the family we came with. All of us agreed by the end of our week stay that this was the most relaxing and beautiful vacation we have ever taken. Here are a few tips to help you out: The Front Desk: This may be our ONLY complaint area about the hotel. We arrived to check in at about 3:00 pm and they told us the rooms would not be availabe until 4 pm. This was not such a big deal because we were starving and went to eat at the beach front restaurant, which by the way was delicious. They gave us the keys to our room at 4pm. We had reserved four rooms and one of them was occupied when we went in, so we went back to the front desk and they apologized for the mistake and gave us the room right next door. One major complaint we had was that the front desk forgot to give us the key to the safe in the room so my mother had $100 stolen from her purse in the room on one of the days. After the incident we went and requested a key and they looked at us shocked and responded with \"wow you didnt get one at check-in?\" This is our only warning....ask for the safe key!! Other than this, our stay went much more smoothly. The Rooms: The rooms at the palace are very spacious and immaculately clean. Our room never smelled musty although our couch in the sitting area did smell a little damp but that was taken care of after we let them know. The shower in one of our rooms was leaking...we never complained about it but I think the maid noticed it and had it fixed which was much appreciated. We left daily tips for the maid and she always made towel animals in each of our four rooms (1090, 1118, 1086, and 1112). For my mother's birthday they decorated the entire room with balloons and surprised her, it was a very nice gesture that the hotel staff made for her. Every evening the maids would come by and asked if we needed extra towels which was nice even though we didnt really need them. The air conditioning in the rooms was very powerful and made if very comfortable for sleeping. The beds were a little hard but not a big deal, just drink some tequila from the mini bar and you will have no problems sleeping!! The Beach: The beach is absolutely gorgeous. We had sunny days our whole week and never any rain except for a few sprinkles at night. Turqouise waters clear to the floor and schools of fish swimming everywhere, it was truly a paradise. We never had any problems finding beach chairs and the shade provided from the palm trees was always great. We were all very nervous before going because we thought hurricane Emily had destroyed the beach, but the Palace's beach was completely intact and it seemed untouched! White sand everywhere and very refreshing ocean water makes it so that you never want to leave the beach. If you walk to the right of the Rui Palace, go all the way down past the last hotel (probably a half a mile or less) and there is a very beautiful deserted beach with blue water and white sand...the perfect setting for one of those corona commercials. I just hope it stays undeveloped. Trust me when I say this, I have traveled all over the world and never have I seen a beach this beautiful. It is like a dream. I could go on and on about it but I will just let you see it to believe it because words cannot describe the paradise. The Grounds: Again, we were apprehensive because we expected the hurricane to have left a mess, but when we got to the palace it looked perfect. Except for a few \"balding\" palm trees, the Palace grounds looked perfect. We couldnt even tell that there had been a hurricane, absolutely incredible. The landscaping is quite breathtaking and very much picture worthy. The Riu Palace is by far the best and most beautiful of the hotels in Playacar by comparison. There are always people sweeping, cleaning, and manicuring the landscape everytime with a smile and welcoming words for you. The pool looked nice although I can't comment too much because I never set foot in it. Why go to the pool when you have such a beautiful beach right in front? There is a swim up bar and also a seperate pool bar that we went to everyday when leaving the bach in the evening with a nicely stocked nacho bar and a popcorn machine...very convenient for a late afternoon drink and snack. The Food: The food at this place is absolutely extraordinary. Whoever disagrees with this had not traveled or tasted what real food is like because this is it my friends. Not once did any one of the nine of us get sick in any way, and trust me when I say we ate and drank our all inclusive's worth. The buffet at the Don Julian Restaurant is very very good and the food never gets old. One of the nights they had was Mexican night where it was a Mexican theme food with mariachis...very nice. The A-la-carte restaurants were also very good. You dont have to wake up early anymore to make reservations because they finally allow you to reserve between 10 am and 12 PM. We went to Sir Edwards on the second night for my Mother's birthday and they had decorated our whole table and the waiters then came out and sang \"La Mananita\" for her as the whole restaurant sang along. It was hilarious but very special to her. By the way, the waiters there are very keen on getting everyone drunk so be prepared! Another one of the restaurants was the new Japanese one called Miyagi. Needless to say, the food was excellent. Top notch Sushi and chicken teriyaki kabobs with tempura ice cream, all very very good. The atmosphere and decor even looks authentically Japanese ( I have been to Japan and can vouche for it). El Patio is the restaurant buffet on the beach for lunch but at night it turns into a Mexican A La Carte. I ordered the beef fajitas and they were incredible. Others in our party ordered the salmon and also thought it was fantastic. The meat itself was very soft and cooked to perfection. DO NOT doubt that the food at the Palace is absolutely extraordinary. On one of the occasions the chef even came out to our table during lunch and described to us in detail what that night's dinner buffet at Don Julian would be offering. He even kindly offered to make us whatever we wanted at anytime even if it was not on the menu...talk about service! Drinks: I don't know what most people complain about, but the Palace is DEFINATELY not stingy with alcohol. Every drink we ordered, whether it was cocktails or mixed drinks or beer were always very well loaded with alcohol. If you want more in your drink, you can ask and the awesome waiters and bar tenders have no problem in practically handing you the bottle. Roy is one of the waiters at the beach bar and he is EXTREMEMLY friendly and good at what he does. Ask him for anything and he will make it with a smile every time. Just remember, tipping these people a dollars goes a very long way and they will remember you for the rest of your stay. The mini bar in the room was always fully stocked with Bacardi Rum, Jose Cuervo tequila, Presidente Brandy, and Smirnoff Vodka. The fridge had bottles of Corona along with water bottles and various soft drinks. They restocked the fridge every single day. It was like living as a drunken king at the Palace! On some days there were even servers going around the beach offering tropical drinks to people...that was something new that I didn't remember from last year. Entertainment: This is the part where the Riu Palace can get a bit boring, but have no fear because Palace guests are free to use any of the other Riu resorts surrounding the area. For the younger crowd in our group, we went across the street to the Riu Tequila to enjoy drinks, shows, and a cool night club with a nice atmosphere for dancing and having fun. The best is being able to meet so many people from around the world. It is a great spot where all cultures come together to have fun. The Riu Yucatan has a lot of great activites during the day which you can also use such as volleyball, waterpolo, dancing, darts, etc...never a dull moment over there. The Riu Palace is more of a calm atmosphere with a relaxation mode setting. I like that beacuse you can relax but also have fun in the other hotels. The best part is that Riu Palace guests are allowed to use the other Riu hotels but the other guests cannot use the Palace....pure exclusivity keeping lower crowd numbers both at the Palace's beach and restaurants. All in all, there is always something to do if it's not jetski's, parasailing, snorkeling, or katamaraning. The Palace along with the other Riu resorts has a lot of great water activities to choose from. Our group did pretty much all of them. The Spa/Gym: Out of our group of 9 people, 7 of us did massages at the spa. $50 each for a 50 minute swedish massage...definately worth it and I highly recommend it. We all loved it. There is also a hot tub that you can use before your \"spa treatment\" located on the terrace that overlooks the ocean, very spectacular. The gym is not anything grand but it is nicely airconditioned and well equipped for the most part. Much better than other gyms in other resorts I have stayed in around the Riviera Maya area. I don't know where some people comment on the fact that the hotel does not have a spa...maybe they didnt look well enough because there most definately was a spa with a sauna, hot tubs, salon, massages, everything. All in all it was an incredible week. We are all planning our return trip for next year because the friends we made both with the staff and other foreigners left us with unbelieveable memories of a great vacation. The hotel staff really goes the extra step beyond their job requirements to make you laugh and enjoy your stay.

I found SEVERAL incorrect comments made in some reviews I have read, so I feel, since I was just there, I should dispel some of the false comments. Here they go: First of all, there IS room service. Simply look in the drawer underneath the television, they would see a menu for breakfast room service. Second of all, there are drinks brought to your room\u2026if they\u2019re not already in your fridge, that is! We have friends who asked for a different type of liquor that was not already in the dispensers, and an entire bottle was brought to them immediately. Third, there is food to be found 24-7: My husband and I were hungry at 2 am and when we referred to our food service schedule sheet that we received upon check in, we found that in the lobby bar, there was a large table with sandwiches and other snacks\u2026as well as a fully functioning\u2014WELL LIT\u2014bar. Fourth, if you simply ask the folks at the restaurant, they do allow you to bring food to your room. My husband did so for me when we were rushing to get ready for a snorkeling trip at 7 in the morning. Fifth, I also noticed that the drinks seemed to need a little weak, so I simply ASKED, \u201cBartender, do you think I could have a double?\u201d Sure wasn\u2019t too difficult to simply ask. Sixth, regardless of WHERE in the world you eat, if it is not the American food you are used to, it can tend to upset a weak stomach. So just come prepared with pepto, tums and immodium. I had a little heartburn for 2 days, but of course, found that it was a bit more enjoyable to endure on the beach or by the pool instead of whining in my bedroom. I must say, the food was absolutely delicious, and I couldn't get enough of it, hence the likely reason for my discomfort...And just so that it is clear, I live in the city, and enjoy eating out several times a week. I know what good food is, and I can say it can certainly be found there. Their menu does a great job at appealing to many different palates. Seventh, there certainly is a full service spa and salon (with services such as manicures and pedicures, and hair cutting, coloring, waxing\u2026). I happened to get a VERY enjoyable massage there\u2026and as far as a disco, it was a brief. 5 minute stroll across the street to the Tequila. Personally, I actually prefer that so that I don\u2019t have to listen to the pounding music while trying to sleep. In fact, that is why I chose the Riu Palace, so that I don\u2019t have to endure loud and obnoxious people that tend to migrate toward those places. Eighth, there IS a beach bar, just a 25 second walk from your lounge chair (heaven forbid anyone actually get up and walk), and I also happened to get some very delicious drinks from the kind waiters who were enduring the heat on the beach to pass around some drinks. Ninth, it is correct, there are no umbrellas at the beach, but previous to Emily, the palm trees provided 100% shade instead of the partial shade seen when I was there, hence no need for the umbrellas. Tenth, there were plenty of mixers to go with the alcohol in the room\u2014tonic water, sodas, and if not, the front desk is very obliging to bring up what you need. Eleventh, the small television across the room was across from the couch, where many people like to watch TV\u2026and I enjoyed a few good movies on the Hallmark channel (not cheesy like our American Hallmark channel). Twelfth, I have heard this in many reviews, and had NO CLUE what the people were talking about: I had no problem AT ALL seeing in the shower, even though there wasn\u2019t a light in there. All in all, I had the time of my life. The ONE negative comment I could make would be that the heat was a little too much for me (hallelujah the rooms are air conditioned), and I would recommend going November or December through May. My husband and I walked along the beach and also drove through Playacar, and found that by far, Riu Palace was the best of them all. Definitely go!", "Date": "August 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "CLEVELAND, OH", "Title": "\u201cConsistently Outstanding Resort with Wonderful Employees & Service\u201d", "Author": "LeopoldButtersStotch", "ReviewID": "UR3739264", "Content": "My wife & I stayed for a short 5 night stay from July 30 - August 4, 2005. This was our third time at RIU Palace and our 7th stay in the Mayan Riviera. Let me first start off by saying there is no PERFECT resort. All of them have an issue or two, with RIU Palace being no different. We have tried to stay at a 5 or 6 star each trip and have tried a few of the adults only, which we liked. We felt that even though RIU Palace is not adults only, there are not that many kids there. (Before we get bashed...YES, we do have children). Anyhow, I will not bore everyone with the obvious details, but let me higlight a few points: RIU Palace is in fantastic shape considering a category 4 hurricane went through 2 weeks ago. The ONLY remnants at the RIU Palace were stripped off palm trees which we all saw the pictures of and MAYBE the loss of a few, unnoticeable yards of beach. Other than that, you could not tell. This is even more amazing since the resort directly to the north (Viva Maya Wyndam) is CLOSED and the amount of lost vegetation at the RIU Yucatan & Tequila. Don't worry though if you plan on going to the Tequila or Yucatan, both are functioning at 100%, except the vegetation. The Yucatan has done a very good job with the renovations and actually has a pool area nicer than the Palace now. The Beach is still wonderful, large with crystal clear water and alot to do. We spent an inordinant amount of time on the beach and in the ocean since we went to Aventura Spa last year and spent a week at a pool, since they have no beach. (We also got tired of 8 year olds cannonballing over our heads at the pool while their parents laughed, but more on that later). The beach bar was NEVER damaged as some reports said after Emily and the 8 ton buoy, while still there on the beach, is really not that big (and it still lights up and flashes at night). And the reports of the \"big glass above the bar broke during the hurricane\" are also completely false. First there is no big glass above the bar, everything was secured prior and it was a hurricane, not an earthquake. Rooms - RIU Palace has some of the better standard rooms in Riviera Maya, all marble and ceramic tile with GREAT, I MEAN GREAT housekeeping service with nightly turndown. We would go to breakfast at 8:15 AM and the room would be done when we got back. The Air conditioning seemed to work better this year and was cooler, for some reason. We also finally figured out the slight musty smell after 3 trips there (it never did bother us anyhow, but some folks make a big deal out of it) The sofa loveseat in the step down sitting area absords moisture and sea air all year with no de-humidifier - that is what smells musty!! - Again No big deal. Service - Again, out of all the resorts we stayed at, the service at the RIU Palace is the best. And I mean better, yes better than The Royal Hideaway where we had our own concierge. The RIU Palace's attention to detail is meticulous, from scrubbing the tile in the courtyard several times a day to the way the drink menus should be placed in the holders on the tables. Everyone greets you with a smile no matter what and they are very, very friendly to all guests, no matter what pains in the you know what the guests can be. The resort, like always was at capacity, with its normal collection of several nationalities. But again, the resort never feels overcrowded. I personally love meeting folks from Britain, Germany, Netherlands, etc, etc. And another point...please don't get caught up in the whole political/world events/everyone hates the USA thing. People are there to have a GOOD time, not discuss the United Nations. They really don't care - regardless what the media leads you to believe. The Brits are some of the BEST - when the subject of the London bombings did come up very briefly, this gentleman from the UK said one thing.....\"Now, it is our turn to get those --------\".....nuff said. The Food - This is where I can never truly fall in love with the RIU Palace. The food is good to very good for an all inclusive, but I am not a big buffet person and the food at the buffet begins to all taste alike after a while. The food is the sole reason we visit Royal Hideway, Aventura Spa, Moon Palace, etc so we can have good ala carte options for dinner. Now, as far as the ala carte goes, they have recently changed the reservation system so listen up everyone...... Ala Carte (lets call then non-buffet) reservations are now made each morning between 10:00 am and 12:00 noon, not 7-9 am like in the past. And you can book the next day in addition. I personally like the old method, I always got what I wanted because I would set the alarm, run down at 6:50 am, be first get the reservation than run back to bed. Now, there is a line of 30-60 people which starts forming at 9:40 AM and everyone is mad because they want to be at the beach or need to leave for a tour. Adn let me tell you something, the curent day is practically filled very early from folks booking from the day before. So you can be one of the first in line and not get anything for the current night. I understand there is no perfect system, I actually liked the old one. The other problem is that the two best non-buffets are very, very small, seating only 40 people each. (Sir Edward & Miyagi). I call them non-buffets because a true ala-carte allows you to come anytime, not at just 6:30 & 9:00. Overall the food at Sir Edwards & Miyagi was very good, but Miyagi was way too slow for what you got. This actually was not the restaurant's fault but the inconsiderate guests who came in groups of 10 with kids 20 minutes late and expected everyone to wait for them since all the food comes out in courses. My best advice is to try alot of foods and be open minded. Don Julian, the buffet had great carving stations every night and pasta stations - it was the skillet meats at the main buffet that all tasted alike. Breakfast was exactly the same everyday, but that is expected at all buffets. Again, we prefer sit-down ala cartes where you can order off of a menu for dinner. RIU Palace as a whole, does a very good job with what they have to work with. We went in late July this year for family reasons, we usually go in early May and there were a few big differences.....Number one was bugs. I realize I am in the jungle in July but in 7 trips we never encountered that many mosquitos ever. Please do yourself a favor and bring bug spray. This also ruins the dinner experience at La-Traviata and El Patio, the two outdoor restaurants near the pool. Second was school was out and we never encountered that many kids at a resort that really isn' tfamily oriented. I cannot fathom why a family would go to RIU Palace with no child amenities when there is a great Iberostar complex two doors down and a fantstic 6 star Iberostar 15 miles north with lazy river, kid clubs, suites, ala cartes, etc, etc, etc. We would never take our kids here...period. They would be bored in my opinion, which would lead them to sit at the swim up bar all day order food and non-alcoholic drinks and spill it all in the pool. It would lead them to flood the bathroom at the pool, cannonball 20 times an hour off the side of the pool while honeymooners are trying to order a glass of champagne, or something like that. (those all happended). look I know they have as much rights, etc, etc, etc...but please, where are the parents??? I think the parents were waiting for a staff member to say something and no staff member is going to reprimand a guest - some it whent on and on and on. What really got interesting were the teenagers who were under 18 with the red wristbands that could not drink. Well, guess what color the other side of the red wristband is?...White. Which happens to be the same color as the adult wristbands. Again, not to beat a dead horse, but where are the parents and why would you bring a family, especially small kids, to a non-family resort? As a whole, it was a very good trip at a consistently great resort. The place has some challenges as far as dining, but the RIU Palace makes up for it in other areas. We will go back, but not in late July - When we do go back, we might try the new RIU Palace Riviera Maya scheduled to open in February, 2006. It is about 6 lots north of the current Palace between the Allegro and the Reef Club. It is going to be great.", "Date": "August 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cRiu Palace -- It really is the Corona commercial!\u201d", "Author": "deputysilva", "ReviewID": "UR3734641", "Content": "WOW!! Well, Annabana (my wife) and I just got back last night from a week's stay at the Palace. I have lots to write but I will try to keep this as informative as possible. I've kept up with TripAdvisor for about 2 months before our stay at the palace. I have to say that most of the reviews are very correct. Our stay was from the 26th of July through the 2nd of August. Our Travel Agent booked our trip through RunAway Tours which did a fairly decent job at getting us to and from the Palace without any hiccups. The Cancun airport can be tricky when you are trying to find your driver. Do not get suckered into one of the many salesmen trying to sell you a cab ride to your destination. Be sure that when you do find your driver double check that they have a document that has your name on it. (Don't hesitate to be firm with anyone trying to be pushy, i.e (Taxi Drivers). With that said, I will begin my review of the palace. Introduction: The ride to the Palace is not much to look at. Very rural and poor. (The Hurricane that came through did very minimal damage so have no worries). As we arrived at the Palace you will understand why they call it as such! It is huge. It is clearly the best looking resort next to all of it's sizeably smaller neighbors. As we proceeded through the doors we were greeted by an extremely friendly concierge. She gave us a very detailed orientation of the grounds, where and when the meals were served, etc. We did not however, receive any welcome drink. It was fine though, we didn't even realize it until we were in our room. We were assigned to room 1147! If you can get this room, get it! It was perfect. A courtyard view, overlooking the beautiful fountains. Our room was very clean and did not smell at all musty. The A/C in the room was top notch. Almost too cold at times, but I enjoyed it as the weather in Playa del Carmen at this time is extremely hot! The beds were a little firm, I know everyone comments on this so I had to as well. We asked for a mattress pad and were none the wiser. Lots of closet space, plenty of dresser drawer space for all of your clothes and belongings. GROUNDS: After hearing very little about the damage of Hurricane Emily I was unsure about what the grounds would look like. Let me tell you that we could hardly even tell that anything happened at all. Some of the flowers from the shrubery are missing, some palm fronds were missing and that was about it. It was so clean, I couldn't believe it. The pools at the palace are very nice. They have a party side and a quiet side. Party side, of course where the bar is, has volleyball. The quiet side is where we spent most of our time, relaxing and taking in the sun! Now I will segue into the beach! BEACH: UNBELIEVABLE! Turquoise is the color of the water. The Palace has the best beach, hands down. It has the best of both worlds, shade and sun. We never had a hard time finding a lounge. The water is not only amazing in color, but the temperature is about 82 degrees! It is so warm! We took a walk down the beach on both sides of the Palace and it will make you appreciate how good you have it. Some of the other beaches are extremely busy, some have a lot of seaweed and other junk floating in the water. At the Palace, its just beautiful water and white sand. FOOD: I will be as detailed as possible. I'm sure everyone wants to know how the food was. I was very impressed with the amount of food and the presentation. I will start by telling you that you no longer have to wake up early to make reservations! You can now make reservations from 1000-1200. Much better. Don Julians which is where you will eat a lot of your meals is very good. I can only describe it as a grand buffet. It is catered more to the european pallete but it was very good. I was always able to find something yummy. Miyagi: Japanese style- Sashimi and tempura. Very tasty meal, you won't be too full though. Hey, you can always go to Don Julians if you're still hungry. Miyagis seems to be the most popular place but I wasn't totally impressed. Sir Edwards was very nice but too quiet. It was very formal. Food was very tasty, believe you me, they will try to get you drunk so be careful.... I was extremely impressed with the very underrated \"La Bodega\" Let me tell you, this was a feast! They serve you with 5 different kinds of meat! It was wonderful. I have never been so full in my life! Not sure if it was just me, but I was dissapointed in the dessert selection. It was pretty much just chocolate candies and little cakes. It was fine though, I couldn't eat much more after dinner anyway. Evening entertainment: After dinner everyone heads out to the courtyard to watch the live shows. We saw the Michael Jackson show which was rather interesting. Lots of dancing shows but if you want more to do after 11:00pm you'll have to venture out to 5th St. (Carlos n' Charlies or Senor Frogs). Overall: The price that you pay for the Palace is well worth it. There are so many details that this review does not do it justice. You will have to see for yourself. If I could do anything over, I would go to the Palace in March. Reason being, it was super hot during our stay. Almost too hot to do any excursions. If you go to the Yucatan Peninsula, stay at this resort. You will be well taken care of. If I've missed anything, my wife Annabana will cover it.

This place is amazing...from when you walk in to when you check out this place rocks. The beds were hard and I knew that from the other reviews so I ordered the pads and they were delivered to me with in 1/2 hour. Beds and the room were always clean, room wasn't musty, we were in room 2063 (third floor), which over looks the fountains and is well worth the money...if you don't book it at home then slip them some money at the desk and ask them to upgrade you. While we were there the changed the rule to booking for meals..for all you lazy guys....now you book from 10am-12pm and at the lobby instead of at the restaurant. you can also book for 3 days in advance. This was a huge bonus as the waking up early wasn't an issue with me but when we got there you really don't like to wake up that early unless you were picky on the restaurant and time you wanted..don't believe everything you read here..some people are just out to make a bad name for this place. I didn't like the El Patio very much but the rest of the places are great and make excellent food. Beach: WAS amazing!!, lots of nice sand, water was great..not rocky as people say..I never went into the pool...not once....so I can't comment but the beach was great. Don't pay all this money to play in a pool....do that at home...save the money. There were always 100+ beach chairs to use..never had to wait or wake up early to get a chair.... Service: A++++ Everything I asked for I got..even asked for coconut rum in the room and bam...1/2 hour and it was in the room already..a full 750ml bottle. We got our honeymoon \"kit\" which was nice...got the nice towels folding into animals and that was very nice....we got about 5 made for us within the 2 weeks. Beds were turned down around 8pm every night as we has some afternoon naps and the beds were always made for the evenings. Staying for 2 weeks staff gets very freindly and shakes your hand on the way by and even some get to know you by name so it gets very cozy. I never got sick once in 2 weeks, food was always fresh and was replaced 5-6 times each in the sitting we were at. My only complait was with our sunquest tour girl, she never bent over backward once for us, even though we had some tough times with the huricane, which btw the staff took care of very well and never once did I feel unsafe and nor did we not have power, hydro or even food..as we had a hot breakfast the next morning :thumbs up: this place rocks!! I would go back in a minute and next year they are openingup the grand palace just up the street...and I think for our 5th anni. we will visit again. RIU's are top notch, then excel in everything they do, cook and clean..I have never been happier then after leaving the Riu Palace.

We were all extremley impressed with the hotel, it is absolutely stunning. The service was above average too. We did have the little towel animals in our room, my parents did not however. We figured out that if you tipped the maids every day, you got the animal towels, my parents waited until the end to tip, so no animal towels for them!

My grandmother who is 76 went parasailing and snorkeling with us, it is impossible to not have a good time there. There is plenty to do at the hotel and the other 3 that are located within walking distance. The wedding day was absolutely perfect. Weather, ceremony, flowers, nothing could have been better. There was another wedding there after ours and it rained, so the photographer made arrangements to come back the following day for the outdoor pictures, which I thought was very nice. We were upgraded to a suite free of charge for the second week we were there, which was so nice of them. The food wasn't over the top, but it was fine. I am a pretty picky eater and I had no trouble at all finding good food to eat three times a day. This is definitely not a party place, a few of our friends went elsewhere for night life, but there is live music and shows each night, but it ends around 11:00, if not before.

Everything was just perfect. The rooms are spacious with two beds pushed together. No problem for us. The beds are a little firm, but I have back problems and I slept like a rose without hurting my back. There was a nice minibar full stucked with sodas, coronas and enough bottles of water in it. They refill the bar every day. Also ther are four bottles of liquor (rum, vodka, tequila and brandy) above the minibar. Everything is included. The lobby and all the areas of the hotel were just beautiful and kept very clean. The buffet restaurant Don Julian was amazing. The food was great and there was a lot of variety. The other restaurants were also good. The Japanese restaurant is the most popular one, so for reservation you have to be there at 07.00h in the morning. The swimming pool was nice. There is a quit and a crowded side where they play volleybal. The beach was one of the most beautiful beaches I have ever seen. It was very clean. We never had problems to find two chairs any time of the day. The bars at the swimming pool and at the beach were exellent.

They are always smiling and they greet you whenever they see you. Even if they don't get a tip, they will be friendly all the time. So take extra dollars with you and tip a lot.

While the damage to the building was minimal, there was substantial destruction of trees and bushes, which made the grounds a mess. Prior to the storm, the hotel was stunning, especially the landscaping, which I would expect to be replanted and resculpted in the coming weeks. Our goal of catching some R & R was certainly met at the Riu Palace, not withstanding the interruption of the hurricaine. The Palace's staff did an admirable job in preparing for the storm. We had a ground floor room and were transferred to a room on the third floor that we had to share with another couple. At first we were put-off by the move, especially the manner in which the cleaning staff rushed us out of our original room. Even though the storm was not scheduled to reach land for 10 hours, we were given no time to gather our things and were asked to leave the room immediately. Sure, the staff had a job to do, but we could have been given a warning that had given us, say, 15 minutes to pack our belongings. Other than this minor complaint, the emergency was handled incredibly well. The hotel never lost power, although the TV signal went out. We were able to sleep through the storm with mattresses on the floor whose matching boxsprings were (as we were instructed) butted up against the sliding glass doors to protect us. The next morning breakfast was served in the dining room, just hours after the storm. Here are a few pre-hurricane insights: I preface this by saying I am a rather discerning traveler, meaning that I notice (and am sometimes bothered by) things that other (less picky)people could care less about. The Palace is the most elegant hotel in the area that we saw. There were very few kids; most of the clientele were more-or-less classy Europeans or Americans, many in their 30's, 40's or 50's. Some of the other properties looked crowded, and the clientele trashy in comparison. The beach is outstanding, the nicest around, with plenty of lounge chairs and palm trees for shade. Be warned: the sun is EXTREMELY strong and you should put sunscreen on every few hours. I thought my after-shower application of SPF 30 was enough, but I wound up getting pretty badly burned, which can be a real downer when you're on vacation. The food is really very good. The main buffet restaurant was great and had plenty of selection. We liked the Japanese restaurand and Sir Edwards also. True, it isn't Michelin 5-fork quality, but who expects that at an all-inclusive? For what it is, it's excellent. Other Tripadvisor reviewers have laueded the staff as outstanding. I speak fluent spanish and found them to be pleasant and correct, but not exceedingly friendly, even though we gave extra tips (gratuities are included) from time to time. The maintance of the grounds was impressive. The maid did a great job cleaning the room, but each day seemed to find an inconvenient (for us) time to want to make up the room. The room was great, large, with a separate sitting area and couch. The bedspreads are pilly need to be replaced. The shower needs an overhead light. A vacation at the Riu Palace can get a little boring because I found that there isn't that much to do there besides relaxing near the beach and pool. Definately get out to the ruins and other attractions in the area. Take a walk to Playa del Carmen, the small town that is about a 30 minute walk from the hotel. The area is very safe and you will find good shopping, bars and restaurants. During our trip the heat made it difficult to do some of these things, so consider going when the heat isn't as oppressive. All in all I highly reccommend the Riu Palace and hope that they are able to quickly recover from Hurricane Emily.

That gives you access to about 14 bars in all. We decided to map out a bar tour and finish up at the Disoc at Riu Tequilla one evening. We also made use of the beachfront dining at Riu Yucatan for lunch serval times. The service at Riu Palace is what sets it apart. The employees really want your stay to be as wonderful as possible and do anything they can for you. If your looking for a party time kind of resort, this is not for you.

I thought the bathroom was pretty dark when taking a shower, a walk in shower would be better, i tripped twice climbing in and out of the bath to have a shower, not good for the less mobile or elderley.

The beach is gorgeous, lots of white fluffly sand, the widest beach ive ever been on, lots of swaying palm trees too for shade if you want it. The weather was not too good whilst we were there, it rained a lot. I know this is the rainy season but some days it would just rain all through to night, we get enough rain in Britain! But when the sun did come out, it was very hot indeed. We both came back with tans, not the deepest however for a two week stay. We went to Chichen Itza - very long day, the coach picked us up at 7.45 am and we got back at 7.30 pm. It is a very interesting place but beware of all the sellers that come up to you every 5 seconds, that got on my nerves.

I wont say much, but you must go here, especially if you have children. We also went on a speed boat trip where you drive them yourself. I was scared to death i must admit. My husband however thought he was James Bond and just wound me up even more. It is a bit of a silly thing they have going on with the dinner reservations and should sort it. We couldnt stay at the Palace on our first night they were overbooked so we had to stay at the Royal Hideaway for one night. It was gorgeous though and apparently Brad Pitt, Jennifer Anniston and Tom Cruise stopped there, so if its good enough for them. However, the beach at the Hideaway is no way as good as the one at the Palace. We would go back but there are so many other places in the world to see.

Beach: Also Stunning - The beach has two large areas - One on the open beach and one under a great number of palm trees. Plenty of chairs and space for all. Rooms: All rooms are junior suites and are clean and spacious. My room was on the second floor with a courtyard view, this is the best location! Food: Buffet is buffet - The food was fine but nothing special. The four \"high-end\" resturants are average at best. Just do not expect gourment food and you will enjoy the buffet. Drinks: The number one issue with the resort - No top shelf, beer is Corona on tap only, drinks are served in small plastic cups, frozen drinks are terrible and the wine is average. Entertainment: The group does a nice job with the evening shows and daily activities. Service: Great job - Manuel is a the perfect person for his job! The front desk needs some help and Karima needs to smile more. Pool: Plenty of space and chairs - The water is very warm but clean. RIU PALACE - I hope they read these and encourage feedback! 1. Change your Beverage service to include more choices - Develop a \"signiture\" drink thats better then a standard mix in the bottle. 2. Have more late night snacks - Cold hamburgers and hotdogs are not he answer. 3. Fix the front desk - Too many people with no answers. 4. Change the reservation system - 7:00am on vacation is too early! 5. Teach the German guests some manners - They ignore lines and push though without concern for anyone. 6. Give Manuel a big raise!

If I am not mistaken, the Riu has been given high ratings in customer service and they do not let you down. THE ROOMS- I was nervous about the rooms because some reviews I read said the rooms had little bugs in them and that the bathrooms were small- NOT SO. The rooms were very clean, and quite large- and there were NO bugs in sight. THE FOOD- I am a picky eater, and thought I would have trouble finding something I liked to eat instead it was the POLAR OPPOSITE. Everything to eat was great. Don Julian is the main restaurant served buffet style and there is NOT a shortage of selection- everything from steak to freah seafood, great sald bar, and an unbelievable Mexican section. La Bodega is a great Brazillian steakhouse, Sir Edward is a great restaurant where I had the best lamb ever, and if you like Oriental-Miyagi will blow you away. ENTERTAINMENT- Nightly performances that are amazing- Professional dancers and great music. Aesthetics- We checked out many other resorts while we were ther and NONE compared to the beauty or service of the RIU palace- they did not come close. LOCATION- Riu Palace is a 3 minute car ride to Playa Del Carmen, where you can shop and eat- Need I say more. The bottom line is, we met many people on our trip who said their resorts were o.k. but no one said they loved their resort. I, however, can say without a doubt that Riu Palace FAR exceeded my expectations, and we will be going back every year.

What a fantastic place. My wife and I spent our Honeymoon at the Riu between May 23-30. We had a great time. When you first enter the hotel, you enter a grand foyer with beautiful marble floors. We had arrived at the hotel after a very long flight and were able to get into our room after a small wait. The room was also fantastic. The majority of rooms are equiped with 2 double beds pushed together. There is also a nice little sitting area, with a TV. Our room was on the \"1st floor\" (really the 2nd floor), about half way down facing the waterfountains. Make sure you ask for a room facing the fountains or you will be facing the back side of the hotels next door. The only thing we were unhappy about, was that the rooms have thin walls. Not too big of a problem, considering it gave us something to laugh about.... The restaurants are pretty good. We ate at the buffet some nights (can't remember the name of it) and the gourmet and beach grill 2 nights each. The buffet always had a wide range of food, whether it was for breakfast, lunch or dinner. I was quite surprised that many people did not try the Mexican section as the local food was quite good. The gourmet wasn't too bad. We preferred the beach grill as men are allowed to wear shorts down there and the staff were very friendly. The first night we ate there, the waiter did a shot of Tequila with us! The one issue I have with the restaurants was having to book something in the mornings. If you are not down at the main restaurant to book by 8:30am for that evening, you will be eating at the buffet. Not the greatest thing, especially if you like to sleep in.... The pool was great. We never had a problem finding 2 chairs with an umbrella. A waiter always kept our drinks full. The beach was also nice. Again, never had problems finding 2 chairs and there are plenty of palm trees to keep you shaded. We went into the water twice. It was rough but lots of fun. The best part of the beach was the hammocks. We shared a large hammock almost every day. The only other issue we had, was that on the morning of check-out, we were up quite early to catch our flight. Unfortunately, the foyer does not have the Air Conditioning on overnight and it was bloody hot! They need to consider turning on the AC earlier in the morning.... Overall, the hotel is stunning and the staff extremely friendly. We had a fantastic time and look forward to going back in the future.", "Date": "July 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "england", "Title": "\u201cwho could ask for more\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3634114", "Content": "my husband and myself stayed at the palace may 23rd -6th june, we were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary. from the moment we arrived the standard of service we recieved was second to none. food- where do i start, endless choice in the buffet, we did eat at sir edwards that was great, wasn't keen on the steak house (steak tough) but hey we certainly didn't go hungry!! rooms- beautiful and immaculate, we got back to our room one afternoon to find it full of red and white heart shaped balloons and fresh flowers. what an anniversary treat!! beach-beautiful we never had a problem finding a lounger no matter what time of day we decided to go, neither did we have to wait long before we were served cocktails pool- perhaps a little on the small side but even so a welcome break from the midday heat. on the whole this holiday was great, the property is stunning and the service was outstanding. if you are due to visit this wonderful place im sure you'll agree so enjoy. if your thinking of going- do it you wont regret it.", "Date": "July 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Place\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3630242", "Content": "My husband and I (honeymooners) stayed at the Riu Palace for eight days. The place was unbelieveable. The grounds were immaculate. The workers worked so hard all day long even in the rain. They were constantly cleaning the tile floor just for it to get dirty again. Upon arrival, we were given a ground floor room. It had rained all day and for one reason or another the room was infested with what looked like flying ants. (We did not notice until at night). The room was cleaned immediately..sheets, etc. The same night as we were trying to sleep we could hear loud banging. Like stated previously they work all the time and had been doing some type of construction at 12pm. We also could hear the people walking on the top floor above us. The walls are very thin. We were told that there was no other room available so we stuck it out. We spoke with our Apple rep. the next day. We had a new room within two hrs. Definitely go with Apple!! Mario is great. He will make sure you are more than happy. We then got moved to the highest floor. It was great. No noise or bugs. The maid service was amazing. I am a neat freak and when I say the room was clean I mean it. The beach was great. More than enough chairs. Bring bug spray. I used it but still got some bites. The food was really good for a buffet. It was always different. There was something for even the most particular person. I must say be sure to bring Pepto. My stomach did give me some problems. I heard a lot of others say that they were a bit sick also. Once I took Pepto I was fine. The best part is the workers. They are awesome. The waitstaff/ bartenders are unbelieveable. They wait on you hand and foot. We tipped everyone. They all deserved it. We also found that if you tip you get better service. Remember a dollar to them goes a long way. Our expectations were met.

We are beach lovers and, believe me, this beach is the very best. I was reading about comments about beach erosion - you can't win a battle with Nature. Of course there will be some erosion, but they work on the beach daily. If you have visited other beaches in the Riviera Maya, you will realize that this beach is Paradise. The color of the water is not to be believed. We met people who were world travelers--you name the beach and they were on it. They told us that the Palace is their favorite beach--in the world! This was our first trip to Mexico and I wasn't sure what to expect. The Mexican people are quite gracious and very helpful. We were never fearful--day or night. We even had a smooth transition through the Cancun airport and customs. The hotel and its entire staff were wonderful. The rooms were spacious and lovely--no foul odors. The grounds are beautiful--constantly being cleaned and spruced up. This is the best hotel for adults. Before dinner you can listen to the piano player in the beautiful hotel lobby and, after dinner you can listen to live music in the courtyard and enjoy tropical drinks. The fact that you can enjoy breakfast, lunch, drinks, dancing and shows at the other 3 RIUs within walking distance of the Palace is another plus. The town of Playa del Carmen is a 5 minute cab ride ($5) - don't miss this fun shopping experience. The Market Place across the street is also nice to visit.

From the time we arrived we were so pleased with our choice. The lobby and all areas of the hotel were very gorgeous! We have been to Mexico 7 times and this was the nicest hotel we have stayed at so far. We very much enjoy Cancun and the nightlife and the Marriott Casamagna and the JW are our top choices there however we have not ever stayed at the Rui hotels offered there. When we arrived at the Palace I did nothing but look around and feel I was in paradise. Our room was very nice and we lucked out and were given a courtyard room on the first floor which turned out to be very nice for gazing out into the courtyard in the evening before getting ready for dinner. The food was very good at Don Julian and we never made reservations for the alacart dining because we did not want to miss anything at the buffet and it was changed every night and had a different theme. We never watched the entertainment but it looked very good. If you want to watch the entertainment make sure to make your dinner seating for the 6:45 or you will not be able to get a seat for the shows. We took the 9:00 seating because we wanted to have a long beach day and thought that 6:45 would be too early for us but we should have thought about that because 9:00 was too late and we were really hungry by that time and then just wanted to turn in afterward. I really think they should have normal dinner times that people are used too such as 6:30 or 7:30, 6:45 and 9:00 are not average dining times. Also the beds are extremely HARD!!!! If you have a need for a soft bed insist on a bed topper. We had to be put on a list for one and were promised one our second day and still had to go to the front desk and call twice before one was put on for us. This was our only aggravation which was resolved and is to be expected at least once on a vacation anyway. We tipped the girl well that brought it for us and slept wonderful the rest of our week They made little towel animals for the bed which was very cute and a neat surprise to come back from the beach too. We took an Alourtnative tour called The Jungle Crossing which was a very neat experience. The ride on the Unimog through the jungle is very rough and the tour if definetly for the wild at heart. The tour also included ocean kayaking to a reef for snorkeling. You tied off your kayaks in the middle of the ocean and then jumped off. It was amazing! We then ate at a Mayan village and swam in 2 different places including a wonderful cenote that just blew us away by the beauty. Make sure to take sneakers with you for any tours, we did not and our feet took a beating! Make sure to take bug repellent! I used the Expedition by Avon Skin So Soft and it worked great without the harmful deet contaminates. Take insulated cups and they will fill them at the pool or beach bar. Your drink be it soda or beer will last a lot longer and the cups they give you are very small and only last a few sips and then your out and walking back again. That is about it. If you go it will not be a dissapointment. It is a beautiful, relaxing paradise.

This resort met all our expectations and more. We were warned ahead of time that the resort mostly attracted an older crowd. Although this is true there are lots of couples that honeymoon there that are in the 20's and 30's. We met wonderful friends durning the trip. The resort grounds are beautiful but some of the rooms have a horrible view. When we arrived they gave us a room facing the resort next door(which is under construction). This was a disaster because when we opended our balcony there were construction workers looking right back at us. We had to spend one night there but were soon moved to a room right on the front of the building facing the pool. This room was one of the best in the resort (room 128). I highly recommend that you ask to change if you are not happy, they are very accomadating. The food was great. There is something for everyone. We went on one tour, where we got to drive a 2 seater boats out to a coral reef and snorkel. This was so much fun! It was really resonably priced and worth it. My advice is to stay away from the snorkel people on the beach. They sell packages that include bananna boating, snorkelling and parasailing. It is dangerous and the snorkelling is a ripe off. Our friends did this and said they only followed a guide that had fish food and saw the same fish school for an hour. Lastly if you don't like to watch weddings the resort had about 14 in the week we were there. This did not bother me but it does mean lots of big groups of people.

Fair warning: This report is downright ponderous at times. But there are a few nuggets in here that can help you in your plans for a Rivera Maya vacation. The USAir flights were very smooth \u2013 Boston to Charlotte, Charlotte to Cancun and hour later \u2013 so that we were right on schedule when we arrived in Mexico. We went through the check-in area very quickly, surprised at how easy it was, thinking that was customs. We were waiting for our bags by noon. That took a while, seeming longer I\u2019m sure because we were impatient to get the vacation started. We finally got our bags and proceeded to the exit, then saw the actual customs area and laughed that we hadn\u2019t realized that the previous checkpoint wasn\u2019t the main one. But no problems, Sue pushed the button, it was green and when I went to do the same, the lady stopped me and just motioned for me to go along. I had read about the timeshare people so knew to be on the lookout for them, but I didn\u2019t realize how sneaky and effective they would be. One guy in a uniform approached us near an official looking desk that I think said \u2018Informacion\u2019 and asked who we were with. We told him the name of the tour that was handling our transport to the RIU, and he swept us over to the desk. Now at this point, we\u2019re thinking this might even be someone from our tour place, or someone who works for the airport. But he goes on to show us places on a map, and asks us questions \u2013 \u2018Honeymoon or anniversary?\u2019 \u2013 and shakes our hands in congratulations. We should\u2019ve recognized the salesman spiel. A few minutes into him telling us where we were headed and how we would get there, he mentions The Spa Palace and how we should check it out and we\u2019d get free tickets to Xel-ha, and it finally clicked for sure that this guy was one of the ones we\u2019re supposed to avoid. I waited another minute for an opening in his selling pitch, said \u2018No thanks\u2019 firmly and pulled Sue away. We walked along toward the front of the airport, still unsure where we would find our transport, when another guy in a uniform pulled us aside. I quickly extricated us this time, and we made a break through the front doors, to sweet freedom and stifling heat. Sue noticed a \u2018Best Day\u2019 representative immediately, and we waited near him for about 15 minutes (and one $3.50 Sprite) before being escorted to our van. A guy insisted on taking our luggage on the short walk to the van. We gave him a buck, and he made sure the driver knew our destination \u2013 RIU Palace. We drove along the main highway for about a half-hour or so, then veered off to a smallish but nice resort and dropped off a couple. The driver pulled back out and told us RIU Palace was next. Ten minutes or so later we were there, and the few couples left on the bus said \u2018Wow\u2019 when they saw the entrance. It was kind of cool to think we would be staying at the best. The lobby was expansive and well appointed, with plush, red sitting pagodas, shining marble tile underfoot and somewhat garish chandeliers high above. The front desk was busy. We waited in line about 10 minutes before being helped by a smiling but distracted female employee. As she went through the wheres, whats and whens of the hotel, another worker brought us our welcome fruit drinks. A very pleasant welcome. As she finished her instructions, I mentioned that I had emailed a request ahead of time, and she asked another worker who seemed to be the boss. He smiled and said \u2018yes, I know what you wanted, but I give you much better. You face the courtyard.\u2019 When someone that I\u2019m buying something from tells me \u2018I give you something better than you ask for,\u2019 my knee-jerk reaction is to think of the car salesman Eugene Levy played in \u2018Vacation,\u2019 when he tells Clark he doesn\u2019t have the Arctic Blue Sports Sedan in stock, but instead he gets much better \u2013 the Family Truckster. So I laughed, said \u2018much better, ok,\u2019 and we were off to our room right away because it was already ready for us. We were going to take our bags, but a worker with his little luggage cart insisted that he take it for us. I forgot my welcome drink at the desk, and the woman called out to remind me to take it. I had done so much research beforehand that it actually detracted a little from the experience, because upon seeing the room, though I was excited, I wasn\u2019t totally psyched because I had seen many pictures already. It was a great room, though. To address popular points: the beds are firm, but not too hard. Why they have two put together rather than one big one doesn\u2019t make sense to me though. It was a little inconvenient. Hallway noise penetrates the walls, but hallway noise is infrequent. A really nice feature is the high ceilings with fan over the bed, giving it a chamber-like feel rather than just a room. The patio was also good-sized and a nice treat to sit out on and look down on the fountains directly below, or the main courtyard just to our right. That is, as long as the smoke fiends in the rooms surrounding us weren\u2019t out sucking on their nicotine sticks. The shower was great, big, with plenty of room to move around and a strong, soothing stream. After unpacking, we put on our suits and hit the beach. The beach was expansive, palms everywhere, giving way to a wide swath of sand beyond and into the sea, which was hued in blue swatches, azure to sky blue and back again. The surf was strong but not overpowering. The extent of erosion was that the beach dropped suddenly about 8-10 inches right at the line of sea and sand, but it didn\u2019t detract at all. We never had to work hard to find lounge chairs, either at beach or pool, despite the resort being crowded. The water was bath warm, clear to the sandy bottom and eye-stingingly salty. A man fed bread to a swarm of medium-sized fish in waist-deep surf and schools of minnows swept back and forth through the froth. I took a walk about 20 minutes south, past all the resorts, the last being the Gala, to where the forest still stands and the sand gets cluttered with refuse because there\u2019s no cleaning crew patrolling undeveloped beach. Not sure why it remains undeveloped, but I hope it stays that way. I did some snorkeling from the beach there, almost nothing to see. I grabbed a few little shells, and swam through ubiquitous schools of minnows, but pretty boring. At a pile of rocks jutting into the sea, I sat for a bit to watch a pelican preening itself. I enjoyed our first meal \u2013 lunch at La Traviata, the open-air beachfront dining room \u2013 more than Sue did, but we were both happy with it overall. Plenty of choices, just that nothing was outstanding. I looked around for volleyball but couldn\u2019t find a game to get into. I checked out the scuba shack to see when the earliest was that I could borrow fins, and found out they were only free of charge for one hour. Any longer cost $6, starting at 8 am. Dinner at Don Julian\u2019s was pretty good, but Sue doesn\u2019t like buffet as much, so we planned for me to get up early enough every day to make reservations at the a la carte restaurants (La Bodega, Sir Edwards, Miyagi\u2019s, La Patio). I\u2019d get to the little reservation desk everyday by about 7:15 AM or so, and already the early seatings were pretty much filled, so we ate at the 9 PM sittings mostly, which wasn\u2019t bad because we prefer later meals anyway. With Sue being pregnant, this was not going to be a big party vacation. She didn\u2019t have a single drink the entire trip, and I had just a few a day, except for the second night, when I had about 8 drinks over a few hours. They weren\u2019t very strong. After our first dinner, we were still pretty tired from travel and just came back to the room, but caught some of the entertainment on the plaza and it didn\u2019t seem like we were missing much. We did look at some of the wares the locals were selling on tables set up like a flea market around the plaza fountain. Our second day, I was determined to get in a volleyball game and saw on the activity board that there was a 3 pm match. I was up early to make the first sitting at La Bodega for that night, then did laps in the pool, which I had all to myself at that time, about 7:30 am. Breakfast was awesome, a huge selection and delicious, and I got to catch up on my \u2018Walden\u2019 while Sue slept back at the room (not a big breakfast person). After, I wandered around to take pics of the grounds, and checked out the RIU Tequila, a good-sized property. Though nice, it wasn\u2019t quite up to the quality of the Palace. There were some feral cats wandering around which was cool to see. I wanted to make sure to show Sue later. The Tequila did have a good vibe, with a large, bustling open-air lobby. I noticed on their activities board -- which unlike the Palace\u2019s, was large and in a conspicuous place, seemingly encouraging games and interaction among the guests, whereas Palace let that side go without fanfare \u2013 that there would be a tennis tournament on Friday evening, so I planned to take part in that. Sue and I hung out by the pool most of the day, finding a spot on the quieter side in some shade. We swam together, which we always enjoy doing. The water makes Sue silly. She likes to laugh in the pool, so I make stupid jokes and we pretend we\u2019re professional dancers or secret lovers or something much more exciting than what we are. Of all the tremendously pleasant and accommodating workers we came across at the Palace, the towel girl, situated in a shack by the pool, was the nicest, always flashing a contagious smile and waving \u2018hola.\u2019 Sue liked her a lot. The volleyball was fun and competitive. A perfect mix of players, so that, while it certainly wasn\u2019t pro level, we sustained good volleys and all put forth quite an effort. This taller German guy ended up on my team, and we played a few more games together in the ensuing days, along with Palace worker \u2018King,\u2019 who was a real wise-guy and a good player, and another Palace worker, who was a tall, mediocre player, about on par with me, who worked at night in the shows. Sue and I ended up taking lunch at La Patio, the beachfront restaurant that shared a building with La Traviata, for most of the days. Sue discovered the best guacamole she\u2019s ever tasted, and ate that every day with fresh salsa and thick homemade nacho chips. Birds we identified as mocking birds, but don\u2019t really know what they were \u2013 about the size and look of a small crow that issued so many different kinds of chirps and trills it seemed to imitate the sounds around it \u2013 were all around the grounds, and weren\u2019t shy about sitting on the restaurant tables to snatch scraps. We also saw our first Agouti, a rodent-looking mammal about the size of a rabbit, with long hind legs and rat ears. Later, when we toured RIU Playacar, we saw a herd of them, like five or six, grazing on a lawn. Dinner that night at La Bodega was good. They brought meats in stages, slicing chunks from skewers right onto your plate, with a big dish of sides (spinach, mini potatoes, onion). We sat next to a nice mother/daughter from the Midwest. Sue enjoyed talking with them. She could identify with their relationship I think. After dinner, we had a couple drinks in the courtyard (the usual, mojitos) with Sue\u2019s drink a virgin, which always required an explanation when the waiter gave a quizzical look or wry comment, like \u2018why, who\u2019s driving?\u2019 The ambience at night is incredible. Home and its responsibilities fade away in the courtyard\u2019s soft lights, cooling breeze, plentiful drinks, music (even if only so-so), and the din of blithe interactions of people from all over the world. The scene provides a perfect transition to bedtime, either as aphrodisiac or soporific. The next day I had a snorkeling trip to Akumal planned. Sue wasn\u2019t up for off-site travel, so it was just going to be me. Plan was to rise early, eat breakfast, make dinner reservations (Miyagis) and grab a pair of fins just as the dive shop opened at 8 am. I got the fins and a woman at the shack took 10 minutes to explain to me the best way to get to Akumal. Just another example of the tremendously kind staff. With her advice, I was off to catch a taxi in front of the Palace, a reasonable quarenta pesos to the calle in Playa where you can pick up a collectivo. I enjoyed the ride into town, watching the locals chug and the occasional tourist trip along, past a small Maya ruins site and the Xaman-ha aviary, into the rough yet amicable and oft-speed-bumped streets of Playa del Carmen. I just missed the first collectivo to Tulum, but was first in line for the next, which came along in five minutes or so. A couple of U.S. ladies fell in behind me and I enjoyed eavesdropping on their conversation about their traveling experiences, mostly in Europe, on the cheap, living in hostels, eating authentic cuisine, things like that. We spoke a few words to each other on the bus trip since we were sitting right next to each other. As I saw the Akumal exit approaching, I told the driver, \u2018Akumal por favor,\u2019 and he pulled into a turnout. I handed him two twenties (pesos), not sure exactly how much the trip cost, and he asked it I was paying for anyone else. \u2018No, solo mi.\u2019 he handed me back one of the twenties. Very cheap transport. I knew from what the scuba shack lady told me that I had to cross the highway to get to the Akumal entrance. It was about a five minute walk from the highway to the arch proclaiming \u2018Akumal,\u2019 past a water purifying plant and the Akumal biblioteca, which was being tended to by a young woman who carefully swept its steps, dressed delicately in a sundress with a sweater folded around her shoulders. A feeling akin to envy at the beautiful simplicity of what her life must be like struck me. The reality probably was that her life was not simple at all, that she had as many everyday troubles as me. But why let reality get in the way of a tourist\u2019s vantage point? At the archway, there was a hotel whose open-air lobby I passed through, and shops, a bank, some taxis, parking areas, and a flea-market style peddler\u2019s row. A treed park gave way to the beach, where I was approached by a Mexican looking to give me a personal snorkeling tour. He promised to show me tortugas and all the best fish. I promised that, if on my own I didn\u2019t see anything good, I would be coming back to him. It was still early enough that there were only a few people on the beach, which curved out far to my right as I faced the water. To my left, the beach came to an end as the shoreline became rocky and jutted out. Beyond that, where I could not see but was told, the beach picks up again around a bay known as Half-Moon. I wanted to get a feel for the place and maybe get some info from a local on the best entry point, so I ambled over to a beach-front restaurant just to my right and ordered a beer. Never too early para una cerveza en Mexico. The waiter told me he\u2019d bring it to me so I took a seat in one of several wooden beach chairs situated along a low wall that separated the restaurant\u2019s outdoor seating area from the beach proper. Relaxing there in anticipation \u2013 waiting for a beer, feeling the breeze-tempered sun, smelling the salted sea, hearing the muted excitability of a few hung-over tourists eating breakfast, wondering exactly what kind of exotic creatures I\u2019d be seeing, and whether they\u2019d include a majestic sea turtle \u2013 may have been the best four minutes of my vacation. Directly in front of the restaurant, close to shore and further off, many boats rocked on the waves. I assumed I\u2019d be going off a little down the beach, away from the boats. When the waiter delivered my beer, I asked him about it -- first in broken Spanish before he switched, effortlessly (as was common among the locals) into English -- and he dismissed that notion, informing me that if I wanted to see turtles, then I should enter the water right where the boats were and swim out to just past where the furthest boat from shore was moored. Could I just leave my bag here in my chair? Of course, senor. I thanked and paid him, then sat back to imbibe the beer and ambience. I soaked it in for a while, then hit the bathroom, which was behind the inside seating area, past a little courtyard with outdoor showers. I don\u2019t recall the name of the restaurant and I\u2019m hoping this description will be enough to trigger someone familiar with the area to write me back with its name. I was primed for a great experience by the time I hit the water. I haven\u2019t snorkeled much and was trepidatious at first as the sand became rock right at the water\u2019s edge. But as soon as I was thigh-deep, I just fell to my belly and crawled my way along. Immediately I saw little fish. I swam past boats into deeper water, the sea floor dropping away, sand giving way to a bed of sea grass. The visibility was great, but not crystal clear. I saw a large, shadowy shape in the distance. It was too big to be anything but a rock, but I propelled myself toward it in curiosity. As I got closer, it took shape, my mouth drying and stomach leaping as it dawned on me that this \u2018boulder\u2019 was moving. No more than 15 feet below me was a gargantuan sea turtle, not bothered in the least by my clumsy splashing. He had a head the size of a pineapple, his beaked mouth lazily opening and closing on clumps of grass. Attached to its back was the biggest remora I\u2019d ever seen, probably four feet long, but still shy of covering the shell\u2019s diameter. I stayed with him for a while, occasionally raising my head above the water to make sure no boats were bearing down on me, before my excitement ebbed to an urge to see what else I could discover. In the two hours I spent there, I saw massive amounts of exotic fish \u2013 including a really cool-looking reed-shaped fish that was vertical instead of horizontal, and a large, long silvery bugger that darted off before I could get a good look at him, but that I suspect was a barracuda -- incredible coral formations, another turtle -- much smaller, and playful, leading me on a chase, continually rising to the surface four or five feet in front of me before diving again, leaving me in his vapor trail -- and one stingray, which glided through the grass in relatively shallow water as I made my way back in. I gathered my things from the restaurant chair and took the half-hour walk up the road to Half-Moon Bay. But I saw no turtles there, and the snorkeling was a relative disappointment. Set along the beach side of the road is a string of beautiful villas, with a few restaurants. Next time in Mexico, we\u2019ll skip the all-inclusive resort and just rent a one-bedroom condo. It\u2019s more satisfying here along the open road of Akumal than behind the gates of Playacar. Bikes outnumbered the cars. Lizards may have outnumbered the people. One lizard in particular was exciting to see, as it raced across the road ahead of me on two legs, its chest and stomach thrust out, perpendicular to the gravel, eyes skyward. Later, as I made my way back to 307, several iguanas sunned themselves in the rock-strewn courtyard of the library. The librarian was back inside. I spent a lot of the next day reflecting on the beauty of Akumal, and I felt the need to snorkel again, but didn\u2019t want to leave Sue for as long a time it would take for another collectivo trip, so I went back south down the beach, past the first set of rocks to a bigger, second set. The snorkeling here is pretty good. Lots of big fish that like to stay close to the crags and their hiding places. Be careful not to let the surf smack you into the rocks. There\u2019s nothing exceptional to see, but it did satiate my yen for snorkeling. Swimming around the first outcropping, I saw that it was just the start of an expanse of rocky shoreline. The water clarity becomes smoky here. I knew from trip research that that meant fresh water was entering the sea. I thought there may have been a cenote somewhere there, but wasn\u2019t brave enough to dive in search for it, especially in the fuscous light of near-dusk. There was a fisherman casting deep into the ocean and I tried to explain how many big fish I was seeing right next to shore, but my English was gibberish in his German ears. Having had enough snorkeling, I decided to explore the rocks for tide pools. I didn\u2019t find much interesting life in them, though. I walked along the intertidal shoreline for quite a while, not seeing much, then decided to make my way back, this time through a path on the edge of the forest. Here I saw five or six small lizards, which was almost worth the swarms of gnats that intermittently hung head-level along the path. It was getting closer to dark, so I hurried back north up the beach, pausing only to watch a small white crab \u2013 there were hundreds along the deserted beach \u2013 scuttle across the sand and down his hole, which seemed man-made in its perfect roundness. I\u2019ll just finish up now with a few notable events that happened during the rest of out time at the Palace. First, the Michael Jackson show. Very entertaining. However, all the seats from which you can view the indoor shows are in smoking sections, which are dense with smoke from the heavy population of tobacco-happy Germans. Apparently, word that smoking is bad for you hasn\u2019t reached Europe. Second, one night a very drunk man and a few others stayed in the courtyard until about 3 am being incredibly loud. Kept us up. I would think a Palace worker would\u2019ve quieted him down. Third, I never got to do the tennis tournament because it poured for about two hours right when it was slated to happen. I think this was the only rain during the six days we were there. Other than a few small negatives, this was a great trip. The Palace grounds, workers, and beach are top-notch, while some other aspects, like food, bed, entertainment, and activities, didn\u2019t quite measure up to the rest of the experience.", "Date": "June 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "St Louis, MO", "Title": "\u201cAwsome Experience.

Arrival at the airport: Go on a friday if possible, the airport was empty, we flew through baggage & customs so fast, we were amazed! Checked in with the Apple rep & they had our transportation ready for us. I paid the premium for the private transfer, worth every penny. You go strait to the resort! Arrival at the resort: Manuel greeted us as we pulled up. He is the best! Always a smile on his face & I don't know how he does it, but he remembered our names! We were greeted at the desk with some fresh cold juice. Since we arrived at 10:30 am. (Yes 10:30! Less than 2 hours to get from the plane to the resort!) our rooms were not ready, no biggie, they escorted us to a room to get changed & freshed up, then we gave ourselves the nickel tour & sank right in! The lobby, grounds, pool & beach were constantly maintained & look as if they just cleaned it right before you showed up. I don't know how they do it, but every staff member makes eye contact with you & says \"hola!\" It's nice to be treated as if you are their friend. Not once did I see a disgruntled guest or staff member, nor did I ever experience any negativity from a staff member. Kudos to Jimmy & the anamation staff for really making things great. Go there & you'll find out. Be sure to go to Super Bingo @ 4:00. The restaurants were fabulous! I kind of regret not getting to Myagi's sooner. It was awsome. The buffet always had tons of fresh delicious entree's ready. The rooms were not musty. I'm not making this up here, it's as if they were keeping watch for when we left, because when we returned, BAM! Nice & fresh! Ask for a matress pad at checkin & you wont notice the firm beds. If the bed is still too hard, walk over to the liquor dispenser in the room & keep taking shots of tequila until is softens up. The only bad thing I can say about our stay was leaving. They really pamper you there. As for my daughters birthday,, they decorated the dinner table, came out & sang to her. Then, at the show that night, called her up on stage & the entire audience sang happy birthday to her. When she returned to her room, the room was all decorated with balloons & streamers, & the chambermaid made 2 animals & put them on her bed. THis was truly a value & time well spent!

Champagne, four course meal...INCREDIBLE. The thing that made this resort shine was its attention to detail. A new specialty trink in the courtyard before dinner, roaming cheese card after dinner, greeting line at every meal, and nonstop kindness.

I'll try to give you the quick but specific run-down as we saw it. FOOD: (first things first) The buffets were great for all three meals. Great selection and quality. Not Bellagio style buffets, but more Flamingo Hilton style, if you are familar with Vegas. We ate at both La Bodega and Sir Edward, La Bodega was very good but I would beg to differ with the glowing reviews of Sir Edward. Being that it is billed as a \"gourmet\" restaurant, we expected a great meal and were terribly let down. Nice room and great service, but the food was seriously lacking. If you truly want a gourmet experience, take a cab to PDC and go to Ajua!, those guys rip (this is coming from former cook and Southern Californian who knows Mexican food). DRINKS: They were great, also had top shelf stuff if you ask for it (why drink the regular beer when you can have Negra Modelo?). Always found the mini-bar restocked upon our return. And, there are plenty of bars throughout the resort. POOL: Ok for me , a bit warm for the end of May, also a little small (my girlfriend thought it was perfect) but we were always able to find a lounger. And, fairly frequent bar service. BEACH: Great. Great water (my girlfriend thought it was a bit murky) great sand, great palm trees for shade and great hammocks. We were, again, always able to find a hammock or beach chair without any issue and without going down there at 8:00a to save one. ROOM: A little musty, but roomy with a great balcony. We lucked out and got a room with a courtyard view. The beds were pretty funny (2 fulls pushed together) and hard, but really no big deal. We did find ants and several other bugs in the room, which we found odd for such a nice property, and it's not like we left Jolly Ranchers on the counter.... Housekeeping did constantly throw my girlfriend's clothes on the floor when they cleaned, which was not cool. GROUNDS: Beautiful, immaculate, and always being tended to by the staff. Great lobby, really striking, just like you would expect in a grand hotel. Bar Cubano was very very nice as well. STAFF: They were all great, some remembered your drink order from 3 days prior, ergo my Mr. Johnny Walker monicker. Manuel was always at the front door and always friendly. I can't believe the lack of tipping we saw. Please understand that you have paid for the room, food and drinks but not the service. DO BRING PLENTLY OF ONES !!!! There was nothing worse than ordering your third drink and only having a pocket of $20s. OVERALL: I think we'd give it a 4-star rating, and qualify any 5-star ratings by saying that it is only 5-star by Mexican standards. The room (bugs and cleaning service) and Sir Edward were our only real disappointments, but again, beautiful property, great service, idillic beach and great food at the buffets. Plan your trip accordingly: If you are used to dry air, don't go between May and August. It was really hot and humid. Make sure you go into PDC, lots of fun at night with colorful shops and restaurants. Don't waste your time in Cozumel (Tiujuana east). The only nice beach is Playa Bonito and you have to rent a jeep to get that far south on the island, the rest of the beaches have guys hawking their wares .. and who needs another Monkey on a Surfboard statue?", "Date": "May 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shelton, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cVacation in Paradise\u201d", "Author": "lds0508", "ReviewID": "UR3497960", "Content": "We just returned from a week at the Riu Palace Mexico 5/7-5/14.

The hotel is absolutely beautiful and meticulously clean. The lobby is all marble with crystal chandeliers, dark woods in the Cubano Lobby Bar, tile and wrought iron in the courtyard Los Mariachis bar with gazebo. The rooms were spacious and clean, fridge stocked fully, nightly turn down service. The entire center of the resort is palm trees and fountains, where you will be hard-pressed to find a fallen leaf, as the staff is out there cleaning constantly. The pools were the perfect temperature and the pool bar service was great. The Riu Palace has probably the best beach in Playacar. Plenty of palm trees for shade and still a large amount of beach in an area hit hard by erosion. We had no trouble finding lounge chairs at the pool or the beach at any time of the day. The food at the Riu is very good. Don Julian's, the buffet, has so much to offer that there has to be something for everyone. Breakfast was phenomenal with everything from eggs to french toast, all types of fruit, breads, etc. The coffee does leave something to be desired, so be proactive and order a cappuccino or double espresso instead! We only ate at one of the ala carte restaurants, Sir Edwards, and the food and service were very good. Getting reservations each day is not at all difficult, but we enjoyed the variety of the buffet so much and chatting with new friends at neighboring tables that we ate dinner there. Lunch at El Patio or La Traviata offers a good variety of buffet items and desserts, along with self-serve ice cream. The most outstanding thing about this resort is the service. The waiters, bartenders, animation team, and front desk personnel could not have done more for us to ensure that we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Everyone has an \"Hola\" when you pass by and is more than happy to fulfill your requests. We asked for a mattress pad, as the beds are firm, and it was on the bed by the time we returned to our room the first day. The bar personnel do an awesome job of making sure your glass is never empty, your ashtray is clean and even replace your coaster under your glass if wet. The animation team runs activities all day long, and it is fun to join in and get to know these great young people, many of whom are multilingual. They also put on shows at night several times a week and work quite hard at keeping you entertained. Other evening entertainment included dance shows and a magic show. They were all good. Each night a band plays dance music in the gazebo from dinner until 10:00 pm when the show starts. Before our trip, I read every review I could find on the Riu Palace.

Some research was done and the Riu Palace seemed the perfect fit and came highly recommended by Trip Advisor reviewers.We were not disappointed. The place is as immaculate as they write about. Every morning and throughout the day a throng of staff was polishing, mopping and doing paint touch ups. The staff was friendly and though ever visible were non-intrusive. They always seemed to put down what they were doing to help carry bags or greet us or see if there was anything we needed.The beach is first rate with hammocks a plenty and beach chairs (some in the sun,some under palm trees) all over. The beach is amazing and the water a breathtaking turquoise. Be prepared to see European style sunbathing, which was very subtle and tasteful but just know ahead that your children may have some questions. It was also fun to explore the other Riu premises open to Riu Palace guests. Each has its own atmosphere. The Palace is more elegant and low key. Several weddings took place during our stay. The Playacar is more kid friendly and has a \"happening swimup bar\" where the guests can feel comfortable to be a bit more jovial and \"let their hair down.\" The Tequila also seemed a better choice for children and teens with a more casual element. The Yucatan was closed for remodeling. There are many activities available right from the immediate beach area and they are reasonably priced. We were able to do a snorkle and parasail package for just $58 per person. The service was superior to any we have had during our previous 4 all-iclusive vacations(and we thought those vacations were great) The rooms were well stocked- no second rate liquor here-the in room bars have Smirnoff, Bacardi, Jose Cuervo etc as well as mixers, sodas and tonic waters. Also plenty of bottled water. We never had to ask for any items to be restocked....the minibar items were replaced constantly. The restaurants we tried provided excellent food and service. We ate at Don Julian's most frequently. There is a great variety offered for all meals. The only thing we missed a little was finer wines, but the Mexican wine offered was OK and flowed freely. At breakfast, there were eggs prepared in every style imaginable, several meats and many freshly squeezed juices plus excellent espresso in addition to coffee and buckets of champagne to make our own mimosas. The dress code for men's evening attire demands long pants, so be sure to pack a few pair....we wish the hotel would consider dress shorts for men (ie Dockers) because it is quite warm in the evenings and the dress for women was very lenient. The only other thing that was a little bit difficult was making sure we had dinner reservations each night...they need to be made early and there were times when our excursions took us out earlier than the reservation desk opened. If there were one casual restaurant that could be available without dinner reservations, it would beneficial. There was nightly entertainment and we especially enjoyed the talented dancers. The excursions we arranged were done right at the hotel at the Sun Trips desk. Monique, the Sun Trips representative, was very helpful and informative. We chose to go to Tulum/XelHa for one day and it was a great combination. Our favorite though was a full day adventure to Chichen Itza. It does take a few hours to get there, but the bus ride was comfortable and the guide entertaining and knowledgable...all was highly organized; we were well cared for with beverages and food, too. The stop at a cenote for a quick swim was welcome and beautiful...we did give our input on the tour survey that more time could have been allowed at the Cenote and the brief shopping stop omitted (the things you could buy at this stop were no different than all the stuff you could buy in the hotel or other Playa del Carmen shops) The ruins were amazing. We could not believe how up close we were allowed to experience them and touch them, etc. We learned from more than one tour personnel that the pyramid is very likely to be restricted from climbing after this year....so if it is something you have always wanted to do, you may want to consider it as soon as possible. There was an abundance of shopping on 5th Avenue only a few minutes cab ride away from the Palace (be prepared for assertive sales approach), but it was good to discover that taxi fairs have been regulated so it only costs $4-$5 dollars one way per taxiload (not per person).

This hotel was unlike other all-inclusives where I have stayed. For one, the grounds and room were spotless. Two, the food was of five-star quality. Extremely varied and of North American, five-star cosmopolitan standard (i.e. Montreal, New York, Los Angeles). The Mexican food, of course, was especially delightful. I wish to highlight the many \"special touches\" that made this place one to remember for my boyfriend and I: - the spacious beach with many symmetrically planted palm trees that offer shaded areas (including hammocks) far from the busy, motorized beach sports; - the amazing buffets for all meals and high quality a-la-carte and steak house restaurants; - the many activities available near the hotel (at walking distance or short $5 cab ride away); - the convenient and well-stocked mini bar in the room; - the roomy bathroom (excellent marble shower) with even a bidet; - the served drinks (with a photo-menu) that are never watered down. Some tips that made the trip even more enjoyable for us: We never bothered spending the money for the tours and travelled using first-class buses leaving from the main bus terminal in Playa Del Carmen. This way, you can travel for $3 (Tulum) to $10 (Chichen Iza) safely, with air conditioning and DVD movies. Much cheaper than the $75 tours being offered at the hotel. Even paying for entry fees and lunch, we were never out more than $25 per person for a whole day trip. Other tip: the nightlife in Playa Del Carmen is worth exploring, especially the firedancers at 11PM at The Blue Parrot. But, watch drink prices. In one \"high scale\" roof-top bar [forgot the name unfortunately] we were charged US$10 for one margarita! Another tip for ScubaDivers, the hotel scubadiving was much too expensive for us so we explored dive shops in the town. My boyfriend negotiated a $30 per dive rate, instead of the $65 per dive offered at the hotel, and enjoyed 15 dives, including 2 cenotes and 1 Cozumel (we had to get there ourselves with the ferry though). The only disadvantage is getting to town for each dive yourself, but it's only a short 20 minute walk on the beach and very relaxing in the early morning. You are also less bothered with crowded expeditions filled with less experienced divers. One last tip: bring enough suntan lotion, because one small bottle runs you $15 in the town. So overall, while Playa Del Carmen is more pricey than other Carribean destinations such as Cuba, it was well worth the extra money if you account for the fantastic service and food/drink quality, and the many activities nearby. I was never so sad to return home from a vacation. Did not miss my own bed at all.

(Would say 'excellent' but respectful of food snobs) Wine is $5 a bottle but very drinkable. Calafia from Baja & a Portuguese Liquor not tippy-top shelf but very close - just ask for Bacardi, Jose Cuervo, Finlandia, etc. Beer was Corona or Modelo. ROH rooms are very, very nice - spacious, sparkling clean. Two full-sized beds pushed together are firm & comfortable. In-room bar stocked with top-shelf liquor. Fridge constantly stocked with water, Pepsi, Pepsi light, 7-up, orange pop & mixer. Plenty of closet space & drawers. Grounds are immaculate & gorgeous. Courtyard tile polished 2x a week, cleaned daily. Landscaping outstanding. Pool is perfect - I mean perfect. Split into two, one side is for the \"whoo-hoo!\" crowd playing volleyball, includes the gorgeous swim-up bar Las Conchas. The other side of the pool is quiet & calm. Kiddy pool, too. Hot tub was closed for remodeling. Work out facility very, very nice. Free weights galore, three treadmills, two bikes IIRC, universal machine, leg machine, etc. Beach was the best in Playacar - both the public portion & the guest-only area. The guest-only part was by far the best - we walked all up & down Playacar to confirm this. Hammocks everywhere surrounded by pristine sand and shady palms. Clientele 75% non-USA. Either Canadians or Western Europeans (predominantly German). If you are sensitive to cigarette smoke & men in tight bathing suits you will have a hard time here. Apparently the smoking-is-harmful message has not gotten out everywhere! Clientele for the most part was upscale. Age range approximately: 98% over 30 years old. 60% over 50 years old.

I won't go into all the good things as they have already been mentioned. I'll just say what is true and that is it is stunning. We walked to the other RIU hotels and they were not even close to being as spectacular. The beach and pool were excellent and the food was great. I really have to hand it to them, the food was really well done. I was expecting average food for an all inclusive resort but it was really great. I recommend trying all the restaurants. Our favorites were La Bodega and the Japanese place. The rest however were top notch. The service was excellent also and everyone was very friendly. Now I only have a couple complaints. One was the disco next door. at anothere resort. If you are in one of the rooms on the outer part of the right side (right if you are facing the beach) you will know what I mean. Every night at 11PM until 2AM the music booms. I don't know what the other reviewer was talking about it not being that bad but it was loud. We were closer to the middle so maybe we were closer. The first night I asked for another room but it was fully booked. With the door closed you can still hear the thumping beat. To me this is not acceptable for a 4 star resort. For the money you pay and the older clientle it was unexpected. The bad part is it is a totally different resort (Wyndam Resorts I think?) and there isn't much RIU can do about it. They should however complain. So if you can get a courtyard room grab it as soon as possible. If not then you will get used to it and by the middle of your trip you will get used to it. Though you should not have to on you vacation. The only other complaint was the checkout time we got which was 12 NOON. Our shuttle for our plane left at 5PM so we were a little limited. They couldn't give us a later check-out time becasue they really needed the rooms (they say). However they do put your bags into the room and provide a place to change if you need to. Now don't let those two complaints deter you from going. Just be aware that no hotel is perfect. The RIU Palace comes close though. That being said I would stay there again in a heartbeat.

Although I had read alot of reviews on the palace - I was not prepared for the beauty of this hotel and it's beach. Our biggest problem occurred with the first room they put us in - it faced the Riu Yucatan. Our travel agent called and asked if it would be noisy and he was assured we would not hear anything = wrong!!! The construction starts at 7am and continues to 6pm. They are putting in another pool, repairing roofs, and the noise was generated by a jackhammer and what sounded like a nailing gun. It could be heard in our room. We asked to change rooms, and had to wait a day to switch to a room that faced the Wyndham. They are also making repairs, but the noise was not that noticeble and it only lasted a few days. That side of the hotel also faces the Wydham disco/club area and you could hear music, but not overbearing. The food was outstatnding, and we tried most of the restaurants. Most impressive was Sir Edwards. We liked the buffet, and probably could have eaten there each nite - Chef's night was the best - Beef Wellington, shrimp, salmon. All excellent. They do not serve cocktails at the restraunts, but you can get beer or wine. Seom folks stop at the bar and bring a drink in with them. We did take huge insulated mugs, and that worked out perfectly for us. No complaints when we asked for drinks in them. We ate at the steak house and it was very good. They do run a tight schedule with reservations - we arrived at the steak house at 715 - got our meal at 820 - and were then prompted that we had 5 minutes left at 840 as the next seating was coming. We stayed a few minutes longer for dessert and then left. Our second room was beautiful, very clean - I was amazed to see the housekeepers scrubbing the balcony area with a scrub brush. The entire resort is cleaned thoroughly every day. We did ask if we could switch to a courtyard room, but were told it is $60 extra per day. The reservation sytem is a pain, but I got up early two days to make reservations. The beds are hard, so ask for the mattress pads when you check in - we did that with both rooms and they quickly came and remade the bed. This hotel is beautiful - but more importantly is the attitude of the staff. They work extemely hard to make you happy and they are always smiling and greeting everyone with a Hola! My friend and I both agreed that this was the best place that we have ever stayed at and we can't wait to return. The beach was perfect, and there was no need to \"put a towel down\" - we always found lounge chairs and just put them where we wanted them. Other information - taxi's to Playa are $5. And worth it if you are going in the day and don't want to contend with the heat. (90's) The 5th avenue area is a great place to visit and has many shops and stands and clubs.

I will say that prior to my trip I read just about every review of this hotel listed on this site and on the forum here. I learned one thing: Some people will never be happy. We honestly can\u2019t find one thing to complain about. We arrived at the hotel around noon on Wednesday. We were blown away by the lobby alone. The resort is gorgeous, and immaculate. You can tell that a lot of work goes into keeping the grounds so clean. We were greeted with a welcome drink at the front desk and told our room wouldn\u2019t be ready until 3:00. They took our luggage for us and we walked around the resort a bit and ate at lunch Don Julian\u2019s. We went back to the desk at 2:00 and were given room 1041. The rooms are very spacious. You walk into a hallway with the bathroom off of it. Then through another doorway is the sleeping area. There is a sitting area with couch, table, television and dresser just beyond the sleeping are. The balcony is just beyond that. There wasn\u2019t much of a view but we had a private balcony with high walls. The rooms were big and spacious with plenty of closet space. The hallways are tile so footsteps outside the room do carry. We shut the interior door to the room every night when we went to sleep and couldn\u2019t hear a thing. We did get towel animals on 4 days of the trip\u2026they were very cute. But towel animals won\u2019t make or break a vacation. I would stay here even if there were NO towel animals. The nightly turn down service was nice. In addition to turning down your bed that actually bring fresh towels (for the 2nd time that day) and take out your trash. The room fridge was stocked with water, soda and Corona. And the cabinet contained dispensers of Jose Cuervo, Bacardi, Absolut and some kind of Brandy. We actually didn\u2019t use any of the liquor provided in the room. We drank at the bars around the resort. Our favorite bar was La Cubana: we enjoyed a few drinks there while listening to the pianist every night before dinner. I cannot say enough about the staff at this hotel. Everyone we met was friendly and accommodating. The servers at the bars and restaurants are just lovely people who seem to really enjoy working at this resort. I would love to know the staff to guest ratio because I would guess that it is quite high. We ate at all of the restaurants except for Miyagi\u2019s and they were all very good. Sir Edward\u2019s was our favorite meal. The atmosphere and service there was impeccable. Don\u2019t forget to try the coconut ice cream at Don Julian\u2019s\u2026its amazing! Don Julian\u2019s is really wonderful for every meal\u2026we could always find something that we liked and the staff was always so helpful. They do a very nice job setting it up every night with fruit carvings and displays and specialty stations. The beach at the Riu Palace is probably one of the nicest of the surrounding resorts. Just up the beach a bit was the Royal Hideaway and there was, literally, no beach. They have to walk down steps to get to the water. The beach at the Palace was very large and very well maintained. If there is an erosion problem there, I didn\u2019t notice it. A few comments about frequent complaints: 1. I was armed with my Glade Plug-In because I had read there was a musty smell in the rooms. Not true at all! 2. The lighting in the bathroom: There are two lights in the bathroom; One in the main area and one in the toilet/bidet. We never had trouble seeing in the bathroom. I don\u2019t know what all the fuss was about there. They use energy saving bulbs and they do get brighter after a minute or so. 3. The beds: They were firm but not at all unbearable. The hotel will be happy to put a mattress pad on the bed for you if you just ask. So, instead of complaining about it\u2026ask! 4. Beach Chairs: We never had a problem finding a chair on the beach. And we are not early risers. I always saw empty lounge chairs for the taking. 5: The Food: We found the food to be very good. We enjoyed Don Julian\u2019s (the main dining room) the most because there was always something new to try. There\u2019s a theme there each evening so before making your reservations at a specialty restaurant find out what it is. 6. Reservations: We never once had a problem getting a reservation at the restaurant of our choice and we never got down to the reservation desk before 9:30 am. The first morning of our trip I was worried about it so we went down at 7:15 and got a reservation for the early seating. Well, the early seating was really crowded so from then on we ate at the later seating and had a snack at La Traviata in the afternoon if we were hungry. 7. The walk to the beach bar: 100 feet depending on where you\u2019re sitting. We brought our insulated mugs and they were always happy to fill them but really, not a long trek. I did like having the mugs though because it kept the drinks cooler, longer. Overall, this was a dream vacation for us. It\u2019s a quiet and relaxing resort.

We had been three years ago for our honeymoon, and this trip was for our third anniversary. The Palace was exactly how we remembered it to be...wonderful! 1. Grounds - The grounds of the resort are absolutely perfect. Every time we left our room, someone was mopping the hallway, shaping the bushes, painting the edge of the pool, etc. These people work so hard to keep the Palace beautiful. 2. Beach - If you are worried about beach erosion, fear no more. The beach is fabulous, and we couldn't even tell a difference. The water is the most amazing tuquoise color, and the sand is so light and fluffy...not packed down. 3. Rooms - Although nice, the rooms would probably be my only complaint. For a Palace hotel, the bedding was definitely not up to par. The bedspreads are getting really old (same ones from three years ago), and the sheets are stiff and rough. I think this is one way the Palace could improve. Besides that, the room stayed cool, and there was no musty smell. The maids did an excellent job of keeping the room clean and changing out towels. We even got a towel swan one day. * Hint - If you want to avoid a lot of noise, ask for a room beginning in \"2.\" These rooms are on the top floor. If possible, get one facing the courtyard. It's nice to sit on your balcony and overlook the grounds, instead of overlooking another hotel or the beach pathway to the Tequilla. 4. Food - It's an all-inclusive, so the food's not fabulous, but it's good. We ate at Sir Edward's (gourmet) one night, and the other five nights, we went to the main buffet, Don Julian. Don Julian usually has a theme each night, like Oriental, French, Mexican, Italian, etc. You can always find something you like because there's so much variety. Breakfast was my favorite meal. Their homemade donuts (donas) are sinful but delish! * Hint - The reviews we read about the coffee are true. It is very salty. To avoid this, ask for a cappucino instead. They are wonderful! You can order them at breakfast and dinner. Other advice: To avoid getting sick, make sure you don't put your toothbrush under the water in the bathroom sink. Use the bottled water provided in your mini-fridge instead (also has Corona, Pepsi, Pepsi Light, 7-Up, and orange soda!). Also, try not to let the shower water hit you directly in the face. We also watched out for fresh produce that may have been washed in the non-potable water before it came to the hotel (lettuce and fruits without a shell). So far, we're both still healthy! :) If you're looking for a fun day trip to do on your own, you can go into town to 5th Avenue, take the ferry to Cozumel and rent mopeds to ride around the island (gorgeous!), or take a ferry down to the cute marina town of Puerto Aventuras (about 20 minutes).

Where do I start? I was going expecting paradise, and it blew my expectations out of the salt water! From the minute we arrived, we were treated like royalty. Now I know what it must feel like to be a rock star! Definitely a 5 star resort. The room was great, plenty of room and very clean, wood trim and tile galore. NO musty smell!!! The beds were 2 doubles pushed together, but I don't like to share my covers, so it worked well for us. The beds were hard, but when your in heaven, why sleep all day? Every day when returning from the beach, we were excited to see what towel creature the maid had left. We had a swan, a rabbit, a duck etc. and one day returned to a huge boquet of flowers! The room had a mini fridge that they kept stocked, and a liqour dispensor with 4 different liqours. I used the fridge a lot, but if we wanted a cocktail, we went to one of the many bars on site. By the third day, Carlos and Herberto knew what drinks we liked and were quick and friendly. We took $50 in ones for tips. I thought this would last, but I wasn't ready for the amazing level of service we were receiving, and it didn't last long. Make sure that you bring smaller bills because the resort will not make change for US dollars (only pesos). So, the rest of the week I tipped in pesos. I would rate the food a 9 out of 10. Everything you could imagine to eat was at Don Julians. I would rate Sir Edwards as the best, follwed by Don Julians, followed by Miyakoes. The only restaurant we were not inpressed with was the grill (steak restaurant). Yes, it was annoying having to make reservations in the morning to the a-la-carte dinners, but you always had a seat at the buffet restaurant. The beach was very beutifull, the water was a bit choppy, but very clear. We went parasailing which was fun, but I don't think the people who run that are employed by RIU, becuase they were rude. Maybe I was just used to being treated so nicely by the Palace staff, that I gotten spoiled. We went to the nightclub at the RIU Tequila across the street. They needed a bouncer. Drinking age is 18 in Mexico, so you had to put up with some kids that didn't know how to handle their liquor and were acting like idiots in there. It may sound like I am complaining a lot, but I could write a novel on how nice the place was, and how great the staff was. I would definetly recomend the RIU Palace for someone who wants to relax. If I were single, I would go somewehere in Cancun, but for us we will definitely return. If you plan on any excursions, I would definitely recomend Xel-Ha. The snorkeling was awesome. If you do this, get the all-inclusive there, it will save you money in the long run. We also went to Tulum. If you go there make SURE you by some bug spray! The ruins were nice, but the small nat like bugs were everywhere, and made the ruins hard to enjoy. We also went to Isle Mujures. I would not recomend this, it was a wasted day.

I can\u2019t thank her enough for her recommendation. Check in was very quick and painless. We had sent an e-mail in advance requesting a courtside room on the top floor of the north side. We received courtside, top floor on the south side which worked out well. The room had a huge balcony which we really enjoyed. Shortly after we arrived at the room, we called the front desk to request mattress pads. This was our sole source of frustration during the trip. It took 4 phone calls (each time speaking with a different person) and 24 hours until the pads finally arrived \u2013 thank you to Borja at the front desk who finally made it happen. Food was excellent. We\u2019re accustomed to eating well and managed to do so at every meal (much to the detriment of our waistlines). We are both vegetarians but we do eat fish and seafood, and we never had any problem finding a variety of delicious dishes. We ate all dinners except one at Don Julien\u2019s. The one a la carte we ate at was Miyagi, which unfortunately was disappointing. We are big sushi fans, and the sushi at Miyagi catered to a very unsophisticated palate. For lunch La Traviata was terrific. Excellent pizza, pasta, fish, vegetables and salad bar. Service was stellar. Santoyo at Don Julien\u2019s, Carlos at La Traviata and Jose Luis at the pool did an outstanding job. As did all the staff at the Palace. We brought our own air mattresses for the pool. There is a sign posted that they\u2019re not allowed. As long as they\u2019re used with discretion and don\u2019t disturb the other guests enjoying the pool, there is no problem. The pool water temperature was perfect, however the Jacuzzi (notice we aren\u2019t saying hot tub) was frigid. Plus it is in a shaded area, which does not help. We took an excursion arranged through playa.info called Tulum and Beyond and had a fantastic time. If you go to Tulum hire a guide or you\u2019ll get nothing out of the experience. The joy of Tulum was not just seeing it but also learning about it. Truly a fascinating place. After Tulum we visited the breathtaking Gran Cenote for snorkeling. Then off to a private beach for lunch and a swim in the ocean. We were very impressed by lunch. Expecting sandwiches and a bag of chips, we were amazed at the spread that was laid out. Chicken, fish (only if you request it in advance), rice, potato salad, avocado, fresh tortillas, salsa, beer, soda, juice, fruit. What a feast.

The kids were spoiled and oblivious to the other guests. It was somewhat embarassing to us as fellow Americans to watch these teenagers give American tourists a bad name. I think the resort would do well to try to prevent such \"spring breakers\" from tarnishing the reputation of the resort. We would love to return to the Riu Palace, but are somewhat hesitant to return at the traditional spring break period because of the experience with some rude high schoolers (and negligent parents) this year.", "Date": "April 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "wales", "Title": "\u201cYou cannot complain about this hotel\u201d", "Author": "nodnyl", "ReviewID": "UR3394204", "Content": "Having stayed at the Palace in 2002 we rebooked for this year having stayed at various 4 / 5* hotels around the world but noted & were concerned by some of the comments made by other visitors. Do not take any notice of the negative criticism. Although the beds are firm we enjoyed complete rest & relation but if a firm bed is not to your liking request a soft mattress topper when checking in. Reports of a musty atmosphere were probably caused by the wooden furniture draws not being used. This soon disappeared once the draws & cupboards were opened and a full blast of air cleared the room by opening the patio doors. The bathroom, washing area and toilet were certainly well lit and it was good to see the Palace using energy saving lightbulbs. Our room contained animals made out of towels which made a nice touch & the twice daily maid service ensured we never needed a new towel or anything else. Staff were attentive , curteous & obliging & were certainly efficient in clearing tables & serving you with the next drink. Besides the minibar and optics in the room you are well served in the Piano bar for pre & after dinner drinks as well as in the courtyard & at the beach bar whilst the daily specialty cocktails served on the beach by the immaculately dressed waiters was supberb. The presentation of the whole resort was excellent & the nightly drinks display welcoming guest to Dinner was abolutely awesome and the Palace should feature photos of the displays in their brochures. The dining experience at the Palace is as good as or better than at many restaraunts we have eaten in around the world. Don Julian: Buffett self service with a choice of foods to accomodate all tastes but better suited to children. ( Breakfast / Lunch & Dinner ) Myagi: Japanese sushi specialty in a minamilist fashion. ( Dinner ) Sir Edwards : Gourmet French Cuisine with impeccable waiter service ( Dinner ) La Bodega: Argentinian Meats in a relaxed setting once again with full waiter service ( Dinner ) La Traviatta: Beach side Italian Restaraunt ( Lunch only ) El Patio: Beach side fast food during the day / Specialty waiter service for set menu dinner. Whilst you can attend the Don Julian every night once allocated your first table you do need to make reservations for Dinner in the more formal Dining rooms. Although you need to do this before 10 am it's well worth the effort to make the reservations that you want as the dining experience certainly enhanced our visit & we only ate in the Don Julian for breakfast & one lunch preferring the hands on full waiter service at the other restaraunts. Preferring the beach to the pool it was interesting to note that there is a lot of erosion occurring nearby but the beach right outside the hotel was idyllic with shade from the palm trees keeping you cool whilst a dip in the azure blue sea certainly refreshed the skin . One half of the pool was secluded and suited the honeymooners but the other side with the swim up bar was more lively & entertaining. The Spa & Gym were sufficient for the little time you are away from home but the nightly entertainment in the Courtyard & theatre was old fashioned to say the least & could be improved although you could also use the facilities of the other nearby Riu Hotels. With the manager making regular visits all around the resort and continually seeking guests opinions the Riu Palace team certainly strive to make your stay with them as memorable as possible.

The beach is the best in the Playacar area, with significant erosion affecting most other resorts north of the RIU palace. The pool was nice and not too cool. Our room was near the front of the hotel, and was kept very clean and tidy with no problems.

You can see him all day long visiting with guests and inspecting the property. The morale of the employees is so much better now - they are all very nice, and seem to be happy to be there. Kudos to RIU for turning this place around. We will be back next year for sure! We can hardly wait for the newest RIU Palace Mayan to open in December. My only wimpy negative comment is that the coffee at the buffet restaurant at breakfast is not so great - it is kind of salty and of poor quality - but I drank it anyway. If you are a young person hipster type you may want to go somewhere more active. This resort is calm and quiet with many 40+ people and honeymooners/newlyweds/weddings. There is no disco on site.

Our ceremony was in the sand just off the beach near one of the massage huts. Our dinner that evening was at El Patio.

We traveled with another couple and all left our kids at home. We love our children (ages 3-11) but were so glad that we didn't attempt to bring them along to this resort which is definitely adult-oriented. The RIU is the perfect location for luxury and relaxation. We range in age from 38-42 and weren't in search of a \"party\" vacation. We had rooms 1121 and 1123, good beach proximity and both lovely but we did hear the music from the disco at the neighboring property at night. We read MANY reviews prior to our trip and agree, the beds are hard! Two nights prior to our return home, we saw some fluffy mattress toppers by a housekeeping cart and figured that if you request them, they will add them to the top of the beds. Ask for it on night #1, you'll sleep better! We thought the beach and the water were truly wonderful!!! Nice soft sand, great fun to jump the waves too! We hit the beach by 8 to reserve primo lounge chairs at the ocean's edge, left our towels, etc. there, then went for breakfast. As the week got busier (likely families on Spring Break), it was necessary to stake out a chair or it was quite a hunt! Loved the reviews that advised to take insulated tumblers along. We used ours every day! The wonderful beach bar staff filled them with their yummy frozen margaritas. Then, while we lounged on the beach, they stayed cold and delicious. Scuba Caribe (on the property) worked well for two afternoon scuba dives, one to a reef and one with giant sea turtles. One of their excellent Dutch staff did a thorough refresher course with us prior to our first dive too. We were tickled to be able to buy a DVD of our dive with the turtles to bring home and show our children! The weather was perfect during our week, high temperatures in the upper seventies. It was a bit cool in the evenings, upper sixties, a light jacket is a must. We took $100 in one dollar bills and used them throughout our week for tipping. The staff is so pleasant and we wanted to tip even though it's not expected. The food at the Palace was good, but not great. (I've been on 5 cruises and would say that the ship's food is superior.) RIU definitely caters to the European palate. There was delicious fresh fruit, salad fixings, soups and fresh-squeezed juices. The desserts were fair. The theme nights that we felt were great were the Italian night, the chef special night and the Mexican night. One delicious after-dinner coffee drink from the bar that we enjoyed every night was the Cafe Palace, gotta try it!! We ate at the Japanese and the steak house specialty restaurants. In our view, the effort of making a reservation for them (at 7 AM) was not worth it. Both meals were good but not outstanding enough to warrant waking up early to make a reservation for! All four of us stayed well during our trip but we did use bottled water even for brushing our teeth. OUTINGS: We went to the downtown area by cab twice and greatly enjoyed shopping and strolling. We spent 9-10 hours one day at Xcaret (the eco park) and all loved the place! It was well worth the time and money and floating down the underground river was fabulous!!! Wish I'd have had a disposable underwater camera with a flash! Though we hated to be gone from the Palace for a whole day, we all agreed that it was a day well spent. This is a long review, but this was a special vacation, greatly researched by myself and my mother (a travel agent who also loved the Riu Palace & spent a week there in Feb.) and I wanted to share my positive thoughts about this beautiful part of Mexico and this wonderful resort.

Members of our budget-conscious group of have been fortunate over the years to have stayed at beach resorts in Mexico before (Ixtapa, Cancun, Manzanillo, Cabo, Cozumel, etc.) as well as numerous Caribbean islands and Europe. We do not go to all-inclusives to eat and drink ourselves into a stupor. Overall, we were pleased with the RIU Palace and it is run much better than the standard Mexican beach resort, we\u2019d stay again At the resort, the RIU staff gatekeeper for the guest internet-access computers was typing away all day, everyday, and we began to wonder if she is posting bogus reports on travel boards like this one. Who knows? I can promise you this review is a legitimate review from a legitimate guest. Here are a few miscellaneous notes: Pool and Beach: Pool was never crowded and temperature fine. Ocean is great for swimming, body-surfing, etc., the Beach is long but has narrowed and has visibly eroded somewhat since the storms in fall 2004. Just north 100 yards up the beach from the RIU Palace a crew was cutting out the stumps of palm trees that had been covered at high tide and securing other trees with ropes so they would not topple into the ocean. Walking south from the Palace about 300 yards the beach widens considerably to almost 50-75 yards of exposed beach. The RIU Palace has plenty of beach (50-75 yards deep), mostly covered with palm trees as all but about 10 yards of exposed, unshaded beach has been washed away. This was not a big deal to us as we lounged by the pool but walked down to the beach to walk and swim. Rooms: the suites are spacious, high ceilings. Furniture, tiles, etc. were all in great shape. The A/C would not turn on in our first room so they moved us quickly to another room where A/C worked great. No musty odors at all. Water pressure in showers was great though temperature sometimes got lukewarm at peak demand times like before dinner. The beds are very firm as reported. If you are 30 yrs old you can deal with it for a week, but when you are 60 it can make sleep difficult if you are not used to a really firm bed. The other Mexican and European hotels we\u2019ve stayed at never had such firm beds. We tipped the maid $20 on the first day for the whole week and we got towels folded to look like swans and rabbits as well as fresh flowers three times during our stay. Dining: A surprisingly rewarding experience. Anyone who complains about the quality or choice of foods here is too picky (you know someone like this, we all do). The quality of the food at the Don Julian main dining buffet was excellent, but if you are accustomed to dining at 5-star restaurants in NYC, Chicago, etc., and expect the same at RIU Palace resort, you will be disappointed. It has loads of fresh fruits, juices, etc. At least 40-50 different types of cold selections at the salad bar areas. 5 or more meats, from grilled to fried. 10 or more vegetables, from steamed to saut\u00e9ed. 8 or more dessert selections including 6 ice cream flavors. We also ate at the Brazilian and the Japanese restaurants which were very good quality but in hindsight we would have been happy at the Don Julian every night. Other Notes: Estimate 60% of the guests were European which is not surprising given the RIU chain is based out of Spain and the value of the Euro right now. The Palace has a low-key adult atmosphere, quiet as a mouse after 11pm. No partying college spring breakers at all. Also, the RIU Palace is not a resort designed for unsupervised young children. There are no activities for kids at the Palace. So parents, do us all a favor and leave the kids at home or stay at a different resort. We brought many $1 bills with us and tipped $100 over the week. The staff never asked for nor expected tips, though they were very appreciative, and we noticed sometimes the liquor quality from the bar was better with a tip. There is a guy on staff who sells cigars that you can watch him hand-roll from tobacco leaves. It is a $6 taxi ride to Playa Del Carmen and the ferry there to Cozumel ($16 RT) takes 45 minutes and we went scuba diving in Cozumel with Blue Sea XT diving there (the diving in Cozumel is world-class and so close don\u2019t miss that opportunity if you staying at the Palace.) The resort\u2019s most noteworthy attribute is service and positive attitudes of the staff. In our experience the Mexican staff at other Mexican resorts were generally friendly, but the RIU Palace staff from top to bottom was exceptionally hospitable. Checkout was simple at the Palace, unlike at every other Mexican resort we\u2019ve every stayed at where there were always strange charges to dispute. Keep your expectations realistic--if you select the \u201c5-star\u201d RIU Palace expecting the Ritz Carlton you will be disappointed; if you expect a high-quality Mexican resort, as we did, then you will be very happy with RIU Palace.", "Date": "March 26, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExcellent!

You might not be able to eat until 8:45 p.m., but then again you are on vacation and time isn't a issue. The beach for beatiful! I don't know what people are talking about when they say it was a tiny strip of beach? The beach had more than enough room for people. They also had palm trees off of the beach, so when you got hot or too much sun you could just move back towards the palm trees, but still be on the beach. Please wear your sunscreen. I saw soo many people with really bad sunburns. They did not look like they were having a good time, because they were in soo much pain from their sunburns. My husband and I have olive color skin and tan real easily, but we still wore sunscreen SPF 30. And we got a little burnt but not bad.

My wife is very picky and usually is not pleased unless we are at a five diamond resort.

We chose this resort solely on the reviews that were posted with Trip Advisor, since I had expected to book Secrets. But Secrets was getting spotty reviews, so I looked for something more sure, and we wound up choosing the Palace, solely based on reviews, and then were even more assured when we found the price to be much cheaper than other 5 star resorts in the area. Airport was crowded, but quick to get thru. After Customs, go straight to bagage. There will be many uniformed people trying to help you, but they are timeshare salespeople, and you do not need anyones help to get to your transfer. 45 minute ride to the Palace. When we arrived at the front door, a white uniformed doorman welcomed us by saying \"welcome to your home for the next week\". He knew what was in store for us, a week in paradise. Check in fine, beautiful combination lobby and main bar area. We got second floor room, about 10 rooms from lobby hallway entrance with a view of rear gardens. I have seen people complaining that they asked for a fountains view room due to a special occasion and were denied. Of Course, those rooms cost more, and if that is important, pay the extra for it!! Room has dark wood decor, large closet, 4 liquor bar(tequila, rum, vodka and brandy), fridge with water, mixers and beer. Sunken living room with outdoor patio, bathroom with toilet and bidet, and, yes, the dimly lit shower. Beds are hard, but you can request a softer cover when arriving. The food is on a whole, excellent!! Don Miguels, the main buffet restaurant is undoubtedly, the best buffet style restaurant I have ever been to. Huge, amazing salad bar, different foods every night, always fresh, most main meats and entrees are cooked right in front of you, and if anything looks like its been sitting a while, it gets changed immediately(roving head chef). You will get assigned a table the first day, and you will use the same table each night at the sitting of your choice 6:30 or 8:45 I believe. We eat out just about every week at home, and the food was in the top 10% of all restaurants I go to. If you pay over 150 bucks for dinner all the time, you might be dissapointed, but the common man will eat like a king. Ate at La Bodega one night(ala carte), more formal, but the food is basically the same quality, just less choices. Activities during the day are the usual, lots of pool stuff, shooting, volleyball, dance lessons, spanish lessons, Etc... Beach is beautiful, lots of sun area, lots of shade area, kept clean and saleman free, good security. Bar between pool and beach, can be quite a walk on hot sand, so bring the large cup everyone is talking about. Did tandem parasailing(70 bucks), was amazing, and waverunner(which is not endorsed by the hotel)(50 bucks). both worth it. Had some little catamarans which if you took a lesson(40 bucks) you could use free all week, will do that next time. Took cab to Playa downtown(4 bucks) nice safe waking area for shopping, and some nice bars and restaurants if that interests you. Great liquor prices for bringing home. Did 2 excursions. Lobster and steak dinner cruise in Cancun bay, was nice, little crowded, but LObster was great, and had romantic music playing with a live saxophonist, nice night out. Went to a 4 wheeler excursion, which was dangerous and fun. Not recommended for the rookie quad driver, unless daring. They had courses in the sand beach, and used them fully at full speed, a definate rush!! All our excursions were arranged by our Apple representative. This is an upscale resort, one of 4 Rius in the enclosed area of Playacar., but it is the best of them. You will be allowed to use the other 3, but they cannot enter the Palace. All 3 are within walking distance easily. The most important is the Riu Tequila across the street, because it is the party place, and has a very above average dance club. Great music every night, which is not common in resorts, they usually are pretty lame. Important things to know. Long pants are required at dinner for the men, so bring plenty. It is very hot and humid in the daytime, comfy at night. People dress very well at this resort, which made it all the more impressive. The bars have alot of top shelf liquors, not everything, but much better selection than I have experienced at most all inclusives. All employees of the resort are ultra friendly and will go out of their way to please you, especially the bartenders and waiters. I don't know what else to say except that I have been to about 6 all inclusives in the last 8 years, and this is by far the best one I have stayed at, and the price is amazing compared to the others in the area and in other carribean places. We felt like royalty the whole time there. Please don't hesitate to ask any questions you would like answered, as I know this site can be ultra helpfull.

This is a wonderful resort with excellent service. The main structure and entrance are architecturally handsome and capture the feel of a Mexican estate or villa. The entrance area has a small chapel that creates a sense of Mexican culture. The terra cotta tiled central walkway from the main building to the pool is beautiful with a central fountain the entire length of this area. The rooms are nicely decorated, very clean, and a good size, including the bathroom. The pool is nice but nondescript. The beach is the best we've experienced. It's deep with plentiful palm trees for shade. It has several hammocks, a bar, and a massage center. We were pleasantly surprised to have a staff member provide lounges for us on a busy beach morning. You can also get a henna tatoo or paint clay sculptures on the beach. There are activites planned throughout th day on the beach such as volleyball, exercise, and salsa lessons. Various non motorized activites are also available. The ocean bottom is sandy and it takes a good walk out before it gets deep. The clientel is mixed. We noted a large contingent of Germans during our stay and also came across French, Canadians, Brits, and Spaniards as well as many Americans. I've read many reviews on this board and others and feel the need to dispel a couple comments that keep reappearing. Several reviewers in the past have said that the rooms are musty. We were in two rooms (changed for a better view) and neither room smelled musty. However, our first room was a smoking room and I did pick up a slight smell of previous smoking. For this reason alone we would have had to move since I have a strong reaction to smoke and by the evening was already sneezing in this room. I made a mental note to remind my travel agent to remember to always book a nonsmoking room in the future. We have stayed at three other all inclusive resorts in the past, one in Punta Cana and two in Playa and all three of those resorts had musty smelling rooms..not this one. The other ongoing comment is the hardness of the beds. Again, this was not an issue in either room. However, we don't like soft mattresses so we may not have been sensitive to any hardness since we are used to a firm bed. I also read comments about being \"packed like sardines\" on the beach. This too was hard to fathom after seeing the beach area. It is large and has plenty of areas to find your own place. We have been to beaches where you are literally lined up in rows..not this one. However, the resort needs to make a greater attempt at keeping the beach area reserved for Palace residents only. We saw many vacationers with wristbands from the neighboring Rius using the Palace beach. This is an inconvenience for Palace customers and somewhat frustrating. The food was generally better then the food at our previous resorts. We stayed at the Paradisius in Punta Cana and in Mexico we stayed at the Iberostar and Xpu Ha. We have yet to find a resort that has a buffett like the Paradisus in Punta Cana although we have heard that the Paradisus Riveria is like the one in Punta Cana. Generally, the main buffet in the Don Julian for breakfast, lunch, and dinner was quite good. However, I felt that other on the Chef's Gala night, the cold and hot choices were not varied enough. There seemed to be a bit too much pork and not enough fish selections. Fish was always served but it was simply sauteed and not labeled. We would have preferred more salmon and seafood in general. I enjoy calamari but it became a staple after several days. I also think the appetizers could have been more interesting. The buffet at the beach for lunch was also good but tedious after several days. Cabbage and pork seemed a prevalent theme and I wondered if this was to please the German contingent. This said, the food at the buffets was better then your all inclusives but then again this is the Riu Palace and quality and variety are to be expected. We only ate at one ala carte, Sir Edwards. We felt the food was good but the buffet was better. We also felt that it was an imposition on the \"vacationers\" to have to stress being up early every morning to make a reservation on a daily basis for the ala cartes. One more issue regarding food, we felt it would have been a nice touch to provide a cheese table or appetizers at the bars prior to dinner but that's still not the same as an appetizer with your cocktail. For those of us with 8:45 dinner seatings, it was a long time from lunch to dinner unless you wanted a late snack at the beach restaurant. One more slight negative is the smell of smoke in the main bar since it's not an open air bar. It would be nice if somehow, the Palace could find a way to airate this area for those of us who have a difficult time around smoke. Overall, even with the few negatives which are mainly regarding the variety of the food, we had a terrific stay and would definitely return. The new manager, Ernesto is amazing and is always willing to listen to your comments and to do whatever he can to make your stay a happy one. He takes a personal interest in his clientel and pride in the Riu Palace. This resort offers a tranquil and relaxing setting with excellent service. It's beautiful, clean, and well appointed.

The grounds are spotless, every morning the maids would be scrubbing the tile in the garden! The food was great, plenty of variety. OK, so here is what we didn't like...not necessarily bad, just would have made our stay that much more memorable: 1. It's a LONG walk to the beach. 2. No music at the pool. 3. Entertainment was rather dull in the evening, and nonexistant at the pool. 4. Beach bar could have been a little closer to the beach...did I mention it was a long walk? 5. Older crowd, not a party atmosphere at all. 6. No big waves here...not that they can help that. Beach was very clean though (not for young teenagers though...lots of bare skin). Playa is a quaint, neat little town. It's an easy walk into town and taxi's are plentiful and cheap. I recommend taking a day and ferrying to Cozumel! We had a blast in the huge waves. We would go back to Playa again, just would choose a more upbeat hotel. Rui Palace is great for those who are looking for rest and relaxation. The beds were hard, but comfortable. Rooms were great, very big and clean. We had a room with a large patio that overlooked the garden. At night it was almost as if the band \"serinaded\" us. The restaurants were more formal than we expected, but it was a fun experience...I didn't know what to do with half of the silverware they gave us.

This was the first trip my husband and I have taken in 3 years (since our children were born). The weather was wonderful and we enjoyed reconnecting and relaxing. Here's the quick of it: 1. Beautiful grounds, very clean common areas and beach well maintained. 2. Room was spacious and we had a great balcony room looking over the courtyard fountains. But we had to give $$ to the front desk person to get that room. The first room they tried to give us faced the cart path and a wall. I know things are done like this in Mexico, but honestly those rooms that face the cart path are aweful! 3. Friendly staff. However, asking for things like a bottle of wine to be brought up to our room was difficult. They acted like they had never heard of such a thing. It's all-inclusive, that means snacks and beverages should be able to be consumed outside of the eating areas. 4. The reservation policy is weird. Who wants to wake up and make reservations at the a la cart restaurants at 7:30am. 5. The food was not great. This was my first time doing all-inclusive and I don't think I'll do it again. The food was plentiful and looked amazing, but most of it tasted bland. It was almost like eating a picture. It looked good, but with no flavor. The coffee was awful as well. It was the concentrate stuff, not the real thing. The guac and chips were good. So were many of the breakfast items. 6. The alcohal was totally watered down. We went to Playa most nights to have some good drinks. The only thing that was good was the house wine (difficult to mess that up). 7. La Bodega was worth the reservation. There was too much meat for my taste, but it was all good. But you could tell that most of the food was the same from location to location. 8. I liked that the hotel was mostly Europeans and Canadians. It is fun to meet people from around the world. That was part of the reason we didn't go to Cancun. We wanted to feel like we were traveling somewhere, not just an extension of the USA. Also my husband and I are in our low 30's and we felt pretty young at this resort. That was great because we needed a quite place to relax away from toddlers. But if you are looking for excitement, this is not your hotel. Most people staying there were 50+. Again Playa is a good bet for some evening activities. Overall for the $$ I was a little under impressed. I've stayed at a lot of resorts in the US for that kind of money and were much nicer. I know Mexico is a little different, but I think in the future I would stay somewhere else either going all out for the Royal Hideaway or just someplace 3 or 4 star.

Well, I do not know where they stayed , But the Riu Palce that I stayed at was COMPLETELY AWESOME. I think some people are either spoiled millionaires on vacation or just extremely picky and petty. I looked at alot of reviews on this and other resorts and will give a brief review, if you have more questions feel free to E-mail me. The whole resort is beautiful and clean,the staff is always working to keep it perfect. The beach was unbelievable, big and clean with areas of full sun and shade, finding a chair was never a problem even after 900 or 930am. There is also a dive shop right on the property where you can book snorkle trips and parasailing. We did both and were pleased with them and the price was reasonable. The Staff has to be some of the best in Mexico, always friendly and helpful. They seem to anticipate everything and do not wait for you to ask, they just bring what you need, if your glass is empty for more than a minute at a time it's an accident. The food was excellent and the buffet at Don Julien was the best way to go, plenty of variety and the food was always fresh and hot. They had different theme nights, as well as some standard regular items. Salad bar was hugh as well as the Dessert bar. Breakfast and lunch were both well done as well. The rooms were big, clean and beautiful. They did not smell musty at all and the AC worked just fine. The room was not cold , it was cool. Some people forget that they went to a tropical climate and that is how it smells its not musty, its tropical, you are in mexico. The room bar is as advertised, self serve beer, booze and soda and it is refilled every day. I did not find the mattresses to be rock hard, but they were firm and they were comfortable. The Housekeeping staff was excellent, as was the front desk. They answered all my question about the area and hotel and were very professional. This is a quiet resort without a lot of activities and no children programs, they have nice music in the evening and some shows that were nice, if you are looking for a loud, busy, active vacation this is not your place or you can leave the Palace and go find the night life but, if you want a beautiful, High class resort with an amazing beach and wonderful food that caters to your every need, then this is the place you want. A couple of other things ,The drinks were strong and top shelf was there, just ask. They do use plastic cups around the pool, thats because glass and bare feet and pools do not go together very well, Duh. If that hurts the Quality of the resort I think you just don't get it. Bring Insulated mugs for the beach, get the biggest you can find and they will fill it up. Its not that far of a walk to the beach bar, but no sense making extra trips if you don't have to. Do not listen to the negative, picky people. Some people are never Happy. This place is AWESOME and the price was excellent for a hotel of this Quality. We will, without a doubt be back. P.S. Make sure you get to 5th Ave at least once, its a great time and we never felt unsafe. Go early in the week because you'll want to go again. Last thing, don't forget to tip the staff at the resort, the work very hard and I'm sure don't make much. The tips are not required but they really earn them, so don't be cheap.

I wanted to give a review right away while it is all still fresh in my memory. Having been to resorts all over the world including Japan, Brazil and several in EU I think I have a fairly good idea of what makes a resort sucessful. To begin--- PALACE LOBBY Positives - Elegant, well maintained, cool and comfortable. Negatives - Musty from all the smoke in the bar. Very dark. I would have preffered an \"open air\" atmosphere to give a more exotic touch (like the RIU Tequila has)...however I am sure it's a bonus to have an A/C lobby in the summertime. PALACE ROOMS Positives - Very spacious. Clean. Has additional door to keep out hallway noise. Ceiling fan and A/C. Great water pressure in shower. Mini bar stocked with Corona, Pepsi, Pepsi-light, water, tonic, etc. Also has a liquor dispensor that holds four bottles of various booze including Bacardi and Jose Cuervo. Negatives - Small balcony (where we were, although some rooms have quite large balconies), Two beds pushed together instead of one Queen or King. Hard bed (which I prefer but most people seem to dislike so I consider it a negative) PALACE PIANO BAR Postivies - Quick drink service Negatives - Atmosphere is weak. Your basically sitting in the lobby of a hotel, not a bar. It is outfitted with outdated wicker furniture. Definately some room for improvement here. SERVICE - Only positives here (EXCEPT THE EMPLOYEES IN THE GIFT SHOP WHICH I WILL MENTION BELOW). The employees who work at the Palace are top notch. I have never run across such polite hard working individuals in my life. Because of this wonderful service I tipped a lot. They don't earn a great living but they work for every dime of it. PALACE FOOD Overall I would say the food was slightly above average. The breakfast and lunches basically offered the same thing everyday which became tiresome. The dinner buffett was OK at best. We only at there twice during the week. I heard other people rave about it but I just didn't see it. As for the Ala Cartes- Miyagi (new Japanese restaurant) - waste of space. This was the worst of the three we ate at. We are reqular sushi eaters and would have expected decent, not great sushi here. The sushi we were served at this place was brown, not kidding. It was terrible. Do not waste your time with this place. La Bodega - OK, not phenomenal by any means. Problem is I have been to steak places in Rio so my expectations were somewhat high. I had a hard time enjoying this but my wife commented on how she thought it was good. Sir Edward - Very good I thought. The steak was tender and prepared well. My wife had the shrimp and red snapper which was quite tasty too. Highly recommended in my opinion. The rest of the nights we ate in Playa to break up the AI monotony. For the external part of the resort............. PALACE GROUNDS Perfect in every respect. Clean as can be and perfectly groomed. Very picturesque. PALACE POOL Positives - Clean, bar service, quiet (depending which side you are on) Comfortable loungers, lots of foliage. Negatives - All seats were taken by 7:00 AM...Get out there with your towels early if you can. Water is freezing! Not enjoyable even on the hottest days we were there. Swim up bar in the shade, don't bother, too cold. PALACE BEACH Positives - Clean. Spacious. Loungers available almost all day. Hammocks. Beach bar. Negatives - Beach very crowded. Shoreline has significantly eroded. The volleyball court and a lot of the sunny areas of the beach has almost being washed away. People are packed in like sardines and it is a bit noisy for my liking. (As a side note...if you are considering staying at the Royal Hideaway... there is NO BEACH, NOTHING AT ALL. IT HAS COMPLETELY ERODED AWAY) There is one last touchy subject I feel the need to address to all you \"Ugly American's\" out there. Being an American I was completely ashamed on how fellow Americans acted during the entire trip. At one point, late in the afternoon one day there was a group of Midwesteners carrying on like true idiots. They were hooting and screaming and actiing like complete jerks. Everyone at the pool stopped and stared at this group of about 7-8 that was disrupting the entire place. I have never seen such obnoxious people in my life. Ever heard of having class? Being the resort has a large EU population there were some choice words being said about us. It is true, we are the loudest of them all. In the bars, restaurants, at the pool, beach wherever. You could always here us Americans yelling at one another. Why is it we feel the need to scream at eachother in a group setting? Oh well, please have respect for the countless other guests who go there to relax and have a quiet time. If you want to scream Senior Frogs is a $4 cab ride from the Palace. In summary the Palace is a wonderful place and has many great attributes to it. Seems a lot of the little problems the resort has can be easily fixed but putting a little money into them..(like hot water in the jacuzzi and a respectable weightroom) I wouldn't say the Palace is a five-star....more like a solid 4.

I'm a little spoiled because my first two times to the Yucatan Penninula were free. Once was a thank you trip from the radio station the company I work for advertises on, the other I won. After that, we fell in love with Cancun and have returned a few times, but never paying more than $600.00/each including food and drinks, and we've stayed at nice places. This trip was $1000.00 each.

My other complaint is several in our party, including my wife and I got stomach cramping and a touch of you-know-who's revenge. Not fun. She got is first. I got it later in the trip.

Our stay was last summer (september '04) and we spend 15 fantastic days in this SUPERB hotel! Our travelagent almost congratulated us with our fine taste and added that he also visited this hotel and wanted to go back himselve, just because it's all there: the luxery, the great food and drinks (the real brands, Smirnoff, Bacardi, Johnny Walker, J&B....you name it), so not the ordinnay brands they all like to mix in your cocktal instead of the well-known stuff. The rooms are spacious and we were pleased by the double beds, plenty of room and a bathroom filled with marmer, to make it all complete. The staff was one of the greatest I've ever met! They're SOO helpfull and guide you to your table, putt the seat ready for you and will get anything you wish for....and if you know a cocktail that they (amazingly) don't know...tell them how it's done andyou'll have it within 5 minutes! Also animation to keep you busy for a night...plenty to do and many, many sports to do during the day! (tip: play the beachvolleyball!!) The beach is right to the hotel and it's a white, soft and well-kept beach without peaces of paper flying around and empty cups lying in your way...it's all taken care of....beauty!! Well, this is the end of my review....for those who are still here..it's a GREAT hotel and my wife (yep, we spend our honeymoon there) and I would go back in a heartbeat!! Hope to be of any assistance....if there's something you like to know about this place, don't hesitate to mail me!

It was a trip we had planned and looked forward to for a long time - our first break from two small children. I will try not to repeat previous reviews but just highlight a few thoughts. GENERAL The resort is immaculate. Everyday we commented on how shiny the tile floors were, even outside, as though no one had been walking on them all day. Our room was very nice although the \"king bed\" was pretty funny. We did know what to expect with the two double beds pushed together, but we still got a laugh each night as we crawled under our own covers. It was nice having the stocked bar with liquor, beer, soda and water in the room. We tried asking for more water, even in Spanish, but it never happened, we still got the standard four bottles everyday. The staff is the friendliest we have encountered in our travels. We had the moonlight couples massage on the beach. Only complaint there was mother nature, the strong breeze made it a little chilly to be laying on a table with only a towel on! Something to think about if the nights are cool when you travel. BEACH/POOL The beach was VERY crowded, we were not at all prepared for how crowded it would be. This is the reason for only 4/5 stars. We did go down to the beach to save chairs around 8:30, on our way to breakfast. By the time we returned an hour later, the chairs near the water and in the sun were taken. We were truly suprised at how crowed the beach was. We were packed in like sardines. True, we could have moved back under the palms, but we are sun people and the breeze made the shade too chilly for me. With the beach erosion going on now, there wasn't much room for walking. You couldn't go north pass the Royal Hideaway due to all of the sandbags in the way. Heading south, you had to walk in the water due to the small cliff at the edge of the sand. We didn't hang out by the pool. We did try going in one time and almost turned to ice. It is amazing that the water can stay so cold when it is so warm outside. Also, there is a reason it is called the jacuzzi and NOT the HOT tub. It is just as cold. FOOD Excellent and we never ate a la carte. The buffet was so good that we didn't want to chance ordering from a menu and not liking it. The food was different each night and always superb. We did eat in town one night for a change of scenery. NIGHTLIFE As parents of small children, nightlife doesn't exist for us at home. So, we were looking for a place where we could get out, maybe dance a little, stay out late, etc... Playa is the perfect place for that. Not necessarily the resort but defintely in town. We picked the Riu Palace for the luxury, classiness, and quiet, knowing that we could always head into town for fun without having to deal with the noise and rowdiness at the resort when we didn't want to. We went over to the disco at the Riu Tequila one night and had a blast. Great crowd and good dancing music, for our age anyways (late 30's). Another night we went to the Blue Parrot. Amazing location. The dance floor is 10 feet from the breaking waves. The other place we went was called Mambo Cafe. It was fun, although a little too much. The kind of place where they get you to take a shot on the way in and then walk around with a whistle and bottle of tequila to pour down your throat. Too much of why we didn't go to Cancun. Another night we just shopped and ate at a restaurant in town. It was nice to eat outside the resort and we loved the food - Las Parillas ( or something close to that). One final thought, hopefully not to offend anyone. For those of you who are non-smokers as we are, we wanted to let you know that we were really suprised by the number of smokers. As you are packed on the beach like sardines, know that half of the other sardines will probably be smoking. Same is true for bars and outside seating areas of the resort. Some people are not bothered by this, but for those that are, just thought I would let you know.", "Date": "February 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Windsor, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cGot upgraded from Tequila to Paradise at Palace.\u201d", "Author": "Brimnerclan", "ReviewID": "UR3166859", "Content": "We arrived at RIU Tequila on January 28th. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived...so we had lunch, then checked in. Our room was 604, and was ideally located - close to lobby and restaurants, and to the pool. It is a ground floor room, and simple. There was a slight musty smell, but I brought room deodorizer, so that was a non-issue. On our very first day we received a message that the Tequila was over-booked, and we were offered an upgrade to the Palace. We thought it over for about a mili-second...and quickly agreed to move. In the meantime, we enjoyed the pools, the restaurants and the bars at the Tequila. The food was great! Lots of selection at the buffet. The Meditteranean Restaurant at the Yucatan was very nice. The employees of the hotel are phenomenal. They would do anything you asked, and better than you could imagine. The property looked like park land. Tequila is definately the nicest of the Playacar, and Yucatan group. Many more families, thus more children...but it didn't bother us at all. Monday the 31st of January was moving day to the Palace. This is where my report turns into a dream. Please know that if we returned to PDC, we would definately stay at the Tequila....however, our time at the Palace was amazing. We were given suite #16. Gorgeous room with separate sunken living area. Bathroom had marble counters, water closet with toilet and bdaie, a large deep bath tub. It was a lovely room....with slightly nicer beds than the Tequila. Premium liquor stocked daily. (in fact one day the bar service knocked on the door, asked if we needed anything...they passed in a brand new bottle of Jose Querval Tequila - no questions asked. WHOA! The entire hotel is elegant. You must register and dress for each of the MANY restaurants. Our favourites were Sir Edward (french) and Myagi (Japanese). That said...the buffet at Don Julian was spectacular. Items like caviar, prawns, beef wellington, duck, calamari, and frog legs were nearly a nightly staple. Champagne was always flowing. The piano bar was lovely. The guests were typically older than us (we're 30), most were in 50's plus. The staff were incredible!!!! We've never tipped more in our lives. This hotel is located on the beach...so we definately took in the beach much more than we would have had we remained at the Tequila. My hubby took a kayak out, and we used the paddleboats. My husbands favourite place was in the hammocks on the beach for a siesta. We were definately in awe of this entire time. We know we didn't 'deserve' this, but we enjoyed every minute. We kept pinching each other thinking it was a dream. So...bottom line is I have NOTHING negative to say about our vacation. The Tequila is fabulous for the average traveller looking for fun in the sun, with good food and fabulous service. If the Palace is more your style...well, then you'll enjoy this high level of service, food and ambiance.

We arrived at the hotel and having arranged for a wheelchair for my mother-in-law, proceeded to get one and we were on our way to a great vacation. The reception (champagne and hors d'oeuvres) was an excellent start. Now a little more about our experiences. FOOD. Ample, tasty and various. I loved the Bodega, being a meat lover and also Sir Edward. The Patio and Miyagi are ok. The main buffet restaurant, Don Julian is also good. DRINKS. All kinds. The champagne was so-so, the beer good, the cocktails wonderful. The best wine was the Gato Negro, a Chilean Merlot. BARS. My absolute favourite is the Bar Cubano, classy and beautiful. The others are your usual resort bars. ENTERTAINMENT. The Animacion Team were very good and did their best to entertain a bunch of not-so-young clientele (the 3 of us are 82, 56 and 54). Chepe, Katy, Sonia, Chucho and Jimmy, thanks a lot. My wife and I enjoyed winning the salsa contest. The shows were ok, and the various bands were pretty good. One thing we would have liked more of was dancing and music. Everything seem to stop at 11:00 p.m. However, a lot of the clients at the resort seem to have come here to relax and go to bed early. Oh, well! THE BEACH. Wonderful! Lots of room, lounge chairs, towels and palm trees. THE POOL. Also nice, however we did not spend too much time there. THE STAFF. Incredible. All work so hard, still they always smile to you and seem to enjoy what they are doing, from Karina, the towel girl, to the resort Manager, Ernesto Osuna. OVERALL.

It is our intent to write a long, excellent review on the Palace when we get a chance but I feel the need to respond to recent reviews right now to put anyone's mind who may be reading them at ease. The palace is OUTSTANDING. We DID NOT have to be at the Beach or pool to reserve chairs early in the morning at all - infact, we usually didn't make it out there till 10:00 - 10:30 every morning and we did not have a problem CHOOSING where we wanted to sit for the day, let alone finding a place. If you feel the need to make reservations for the other restaurants you may have to get up early but if thats a problem for you, Don Julians is MORE THAN adequate. We were treated like royalty there and found the food selection and quality to be outstanding so didn't consider the other restaurants since we're not early risers. Really, the reservation process is a good one at the Palace and is common for All Inclusives. I am an Obsessive Compulsive person who can pick apart anything, ask my husband...........the PALACE absolutely was perfect - there was NOTHING to complain about. Actually, my only complaint is of the RUDE, ignorant, abnoxious Americans who would consistently get drunk on the beach and shout and disrupt everyone - HAVE A LITTLE CLASS!! If you have read former reviews, and are worried, please don't be. The Palace, its staff, the grounds, the dining...............ALL are just PERFECT.

I wanted to be sure we wrote a review, as all those who did previously definitely helped us make an educated decision as to where to stay. We went for our honeymoon and spent 10 days (Jan. 17-27). When we arrived, we pulled up to a beautiful hotel (the Palace) where the bellman helped us into the lobby. Wow. Absolutely gorgeous -- from the crystal chandeliers, marble flooring, dark woodwork, the furniture, etc. -- it was spectacular. We were given compliementary drinks upon checking in and the hotel staff took our luggage to the room while we looked around. The hotel bar was beautiful and when we walked down the winding stairway to the courtyard outside, we were definitely impressed. All the other reviews were not lying... The grounds are IMMACULATE. Groundskeepers were working constantly. There is a long and beautiful fountaine in the center of the resort, which created a very \"grand\" appeal. We had lunch at Don Julian, the main buffet, which had endless options. We found this to be even more true at dinner time, with carving stations, pasta stations, etc. Plenty for you seafood lovers, as well. The attention to detail was amazing. There were whole watermelons and other such fruit (used for display) which were carved, and I mean carved, with fish, scenery, designs, etc. The pool was nice with a swim up bar and the beach was very large and extremely deep with most areas amongst palm trees. At this point, I was so excited to see our room. We were expecting something as wonderful as everything else we has just seen at the Palace. When we got there, I will admit, I was VERY disappointed. We had a room on the 1st floor facing a fence (north side). On the other side of this fence was a path where a LOUD gas-powered golf-cart would pass every 10-15 minutes transporting the guests from the Riu Tequila (across the street) to and from the beach. The noise was obnoxious and this was with our patio doors CLOSED. We called the front desk and to be moved to a court-yard view and they said it would cost us an additional $60 a night! That was going to be a total 0f $600! We stayed there the first night and spoke with the manager the next day and he finally moved us to a court-yard view room for free. We figured that was the least he could do, since we are already spending enough $ to stay there for 10 days. Besides the better view, the new room was no better. I felt they were very drab and they definitely did not go with the gorgeous resort right outside the door. The 2 beds that put together to form a \"king\" was annoying. Each bed had it's own set of sheets and comforter, which made me wonder why the heck they evened bother pushing them together?! The small TV was across the room in the sitting area, so it wasn't that enjoyable to watch tv in bed(s) either. The bathroom was average, again nothing special, and the shower was very awkward and dark. There are no irons in the rooms, so we had to call and request one. They delivered one right away. They also showed up at the door exactly 30 minutes later asking for it back. I told them I was not yet finished so they called again 30 minutes later. Weird. I gave up... In summary, it seemed to me they put all the money in the grounds, restaurants, staff, etc., but forgot to \"luxurize\" the rooms. A couple of other things to think about... The pool was ridiculously cold. Even when it was 85 degrees outside, a dip in the pool was just that. In and out. The swim up bar was always empty because of the water temperature and the fact it is always in the shade. The majorty of the beach was filled with palm trees in shade. Beautiful. Perfect for those who don't want direct sun all day. The open portion of the beach by the water, however, was entirely too crowded. People were LITERALLY packed in like sardines. For this very reason we sat by the pool our entire visit. Which reminds me. If you want a good seat by the pool, better get up before 7 AM to reserve one with your towel. Otherwise, you'll be back in some corner of the pool or sandwiched between people on the beach. Again, the main buffet was where we ate most our meals. We ate at only one reservation restaurant, Sir Edwards. This was good, but it seemed as if all the reservation restaurants had a very limited menu. Again, don't forget to get in line about 6:45 AM for reservations. Don't plan on working out that much at the Palace. The gym was VERY small. Not even adequate for a resort half that size. An expansion is something they definitely need to consider... Overall, our stay was very nice, however I can't say we would come back. Again, it's a beautiful hotel with wonderful food and an EXCELLENT staff. Service was spectacular. We toured the Royal Hideaway a couple doors down and we will be booking our next vacation there.

Being set back from the beach is a disadvantage if you are looking for an ocean view room however the beauty of the courtyard makes up for this 10 fold!

Jan 14-21. I read the trip advisor reviews for months before our trip, so I thought I would return the favor. Here are some of the highlights: 1. The food: If you leave this resort feeling hungry, there is something wrong with you. We ate most nights at Don Julian, the buffet style resturant. Everything, every night was wonderful. They have different themes each night, but also have some \"American\" food. Each morning the breakfasts were great. Whatever you could think of for breakfast, it was there. The melon and fruit were fresh and the juice was great. I tried a different one each morning. We did eat at several of the other resturants at night and found that our best meal was at El Patio. I had Tuna and my husband had a steak, both of which were excellent. You will not go hungry at the Palace. 2. Our room was very nice. We had room 2049 which overlooked the courtyard. Our friends had room 2046 which had a view of the pool and the ocean. Both were layed out the same. These rooms were on the end by the pool, so it was quite a walk each morning and evening to the dinning rooms. Also, if you are not on the ground floor, be prepared to do stairs! There is one elevator but it is on the lobby level and about a football fields length away from our room. The beds are very hard and by the end of the week we were stiff and sore. We did stop at the desk one night after dinner and asked for additional pillows. They were in our room when we returned that night. No matter what you ask for, you will receive it within minutes. 3. The resort and the grounds are kept immaculate. The staff is continuously cleaning and scrubbing. It is hard to put into words how clean everything is. The staff, from the cleaning crew to the dinning staff were always friendly and pleasant. We did tip through out the day as these people work 12 hour days for very little pay. They deserve to be tipped. We took $100.00 in ones and used most of them during the week. 4. We booked our trip through Apple Vacations. The Apple representatives, were both very nice and helpful. We took the ATV tour through the jungle and went to Xcaret. Both were a lot of fun. If you go to Xcaret, plan on a lot of walking. 5. The weather was very nice and sunny during the day, but it got chilly at night. Several nights we had to close the balcony doors and put a blanket on the bed. However, it is Winter there now, so it should be a little cooler. 6. The beach is wonderful. It is amazing how clean they keep it. The water was actually pretty warm for January. There are a lot of activities you can do at the beach. We went parasailing on our last day. It was great and I would do it again. It cost $35.00 per person for a 15 minute ride. There were a lot women who were topless, so if this makes you uncomfortable, this is not the place for you. Some of the things that we didnt like or things that could be improved: If you are looking for a resort \"right on the beach\" this is not the one for you. It is a long walk from the pool area to the actual beach. The beach area, both with and without palm trees, is wonderful, but it is a long walk to the bathrooms, dinning area or pool. We stayed at the Riu Palace Las Americas in Cancun last April. If we go back, we would pick the Palace in Cancun over the Palace in Playa, for a couple of reasons: 1. you are right on the water in Cancun. 2. The entertainment at the Palace in Cancun was great. They had activities throughout the day and the shows at night were awesome. The \"entertainment\" at the Palace in Playa was non-existent. They did have a band play outside the dinning area from 8-10 each night as dinner was being served. The band was really good and the resort should have had them play each night for the \"entertainment\". However, then the \"real\" entertainment which was to start at 10 was horrible. There were no \"shows\" but instead they played stupid games with the audience. Most nights we left as soon as they started this. 3. The water in the pool was ice water. The water in the ocean was actually warmer. If you do not get up and reserve a chair by the pool or the beach by 7:30 AM, you will not get one. I suggest that you get clean beach towls at the end of each day and put them on a chair in the morning. Also, to get a reservation at one of the resturants, other than Don Julian, you need to be in line by 7:00 AM. I am an early riser and was up each morning to do both of these for our group. So it was no big deal to me, however I heard a lot of complaints while standing in line to make reservations. This is a vacation and you shouldnt have to worry about getting up early to make your dinner reservation or getting a chair by the pool or beach. All in all, our week was great and the time flew by.

The entry with its marble floors, awesome chandeliers and columns both stone and dark wood were inspiring. The only problem I found was the tile floors throughout the hallways and courtyards were very slippery. I guess to have beauty one may have to sacrifice some safety. The grounds were very spaciuos and requirted a lot of walking either to the beach, or main building that housed the restaurants and bars. The good thing about this was it was so spacious the hotel seemed less populated than it actually was. I am not one for buffet style, but the selections were large and good. The alacarte restaurants such as Sir Edward, La Bodega, and the Steakhouse (El Patio) were good, but compared to american standards the quality of the meats were less than average.

The problem with getting reservations for anything with the exception of the main resturant Don Julian's is that you need to get up and make them in-person before 7:00 AM. I thought that was ridiculous, especially considering we were on vacation. The bars were great. The one thing I didn't like was that too many unescorted little kids were hanging out at the bars and taking up seats. This was a problem the hotel should have addressed and the parents should have corrected. The pool bar was never crowded and had activities most of the day. The beach bar too was always available for the cold drink. The best bar was the Cubano (this was the bar with the kids until 11 at night), a piano bar in the main building, this bar was the best and nicest. The bartender, Miraim was OUTSTANDING, be sure to tip her, they don't make much and really appreciate it. We tipped regularly since we do so in the States, no matter what the quality of service, and for certain the service here is heads-and-shoulders above the US. I don't think the Europeans tipped much and they comprised a good percentage of the hotel. The one thing I think they should have is open BBQs during the day and maybe later in the evening by the pool and beach. The problem is once you eat dinner you're pretty much left without food for the remainder of the night. Although the Piano Bar brings out sandwiches at 11:30, if you're not in attendance you go to sleep hungry. This is really needed, especailly if you get an early seating and finish your dinner by 7:30 PM. On a last note if you plan on renting a car, do it the the day before from 3 PM and return it late the next day, around 10. It was less expensive that way. We rented a Chevy Astra for a total of $110. The drive to Cancun is about 45 minutes, but be careful of the speedbumps and try not drive too late at night. -John", "Date": "December 29, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ankeny, Iowa", "Title": "\u201cGreat spot for a wedding\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2960312", "Content": "My son was married at the Palace on December 11.

This was our first all-inclusive experience and our first trip to Playa del Carmen. My fianc\u00e9e became my fianc\u00e9e on this trip, and I was counting on everything being just perfect. The resort was just as excellent as I had hoped it would be and provided the perfect setting for our vacation. The only problem that we had was slight and quickly remedied: we were originally given a room on the south side of the resort, facing south, on the first floor overlooking the RIU Yucatan next door. The room's patio had just recently been painted and had \"wet paint\" tape everywhere and still smelled of fresh paint. And to make matters worse, the golf cart path that was used to shuttle guests from the RIU Tequila across the street to the beach was literally right outside the patio, meaning no privacy and lots of noise as carts full of people drove by every few minutes. We called the front desk and asked if we could change rooms, and they immediately sent a bellboy to move us and our luggage to a new room. We moved to room 1087 on the very opposite end of the resort, on the north side, facing north, overlooking a statue garden. This room was much, much better. The room also had solid walls seperating it from the adjoining patios, which offered much more privacy than the wrought-iron seperating some of the other patios that we saw. I wonder why the RIU Palace would even try to put guests in that first room considering its less-than-ready state, but I was impressed that they worked so quickly to get us into another, better room. Besides that initial issue, the RIU Palace and its staff delivered a great experience. As for the hotel itself, it is well appointed and is constantly cleaned and maintained. I travel somewhat regularly for work and would consider the RIU Palace to be on par or slightly better than other five-star hotels I've stayed at. Marble, wood, and ornate tile work are found everywhere throughout the hotel. The fountains and statues are all beautiful and really add to the ambiance of the resort. The staff is, without exception, very friendly and quick with a smile and a hello, or hola, as the case may be. As others have said before, the grounds are immaculate and there seems to be a small army of people constantly tending to its upkeep throughout the day. Needless to say, the hotel was spotless. Our room was spacious and well-kept as well. It appears that all rooms at the RIU Palace are more or less jr. suites, with both a bed area and a seperate sunken living area, with a couch, dresser and television. The room's mini-bar contained both a liquor dispenser with full size bottles of bourbon, vodka, rum, and tequila and a mini-fridge that was constantly supplied with Corona, sodas, and plenty of bottled water. The bed was actually two smaller beds that have been made-up seperately and pushed together. So you'll have plenty of room for sleeping, but it makes snuggling a little ackward. And yes, the beds are pretty hard. They weren't uncomfortable for me since I can sleep on just about anything, but I could see why some people would complain about them. I've also read other reviews mentioning how dark the showers are. They're dark, but with the rest of the bathroom lights on, we didn't find this to be a problem. Our room was cleaned by early afternoon every day. Housekeeping also came by most nights to turn down our beds and leave a little chocolate on our pillows. Towels were replaced during the daily cleaning and the nightly turn-down, so unless you use them excessively, you'll never want for towels. This being our first AI experience, we can't really compare the quality of the food to any other AI's, but we thought the selection was tremendous and found the food to be appetizing the entire week that we were there. It wasn't the most spectacular food I've ever eaten, but it was certainly the best hotel food I've ever had and easily better than the food you'd find at your typical casual dining restaurant. The \"main\" restaurant, Don Julian, is where we ate most of our meals. For a buffet style restaurant, the selection was much better than I thought it would be. In addition to what you'd expect, there were all sorts of nice extras like a mimosa station and freshly made fruit smoothies at breakfast, a nice selection of cheeses (blue cheese, brie, camembert) at lunch, and caviar appetizers, a variety of seafood, and fruit flambe desserts for dinner, just as a few examples. We also ate dinner one night at one of the a la carte restaurants, Sir Edwards. Their menu was french gourmet, and this was my fianc\u00e9e's favorite meal at the hotel. We ate breakfast and lunch at the other restaurants a few times but found that we preferred Don Julian for its better selection. I found that the dress code for dinner was not nearly as big a deal as some people might think it is. Yes, men are required to wear long pants to dinner, but that's about the extent of it. Some men wore slacks and even ties to dinner, but just as many seemed to be wearing jeans and tennis shoes. For the men, just bring a pair of long pants, jeans, dockers, slacks, whatever, and you'll be fine. I should also mention that my fianc\u00e9e is a vegetarian, and she was always able to find plenty to eat. So if this is a concern for you as well, don't worry. We didn't spend any time at the pool at all, but the beach was FANTASTIC!!! This is the reason people go to Playa del Carmen after all, isn't it? We had never been to the Mayan Riviera before, and we just couldn't get over how beautiful the beach was. It was really like we had stepped into a post card. The water was a brilliant turquoise, the sand was cool and white, and the palm trees swayed back and forth in a breeze that perfectly complemented the heat of the sun. The stretch of beach in front of the RIU Palace is perfect. There are no rocks at all on the beach or in the water. The hotel staff thouroughly combs the beach every day so you'll never see a piece of trash or seaweed anywhere. There's plenty of loungers for everyone, and we never had any problems finding a couple no matter what time we showed up at the beach, though sometimes we did have to move them to a better spot. There's a small grove of palm trees between the hotel and the water, so there's plenty of shaded lounging as well. We took advantage of the hotel's free water activites and spent a lot of time on the ocean kayaking or on a catamarran. If you walk south along the beach past the last of the resorts, you'll find a nearly deserted, beautiful stretch of beach. This is a great location if you just want to get away from the crowd or take a nice walk. It only takes about ten minutes or so at leisurely pace and is well worth it. It's very scenic, and I hear that it's also an okay snorkeling spot, though we never got a chance to verify this for ourselves. One piece of advice that we found immensely useful was to bring a couple of covered, insulated mugs to use at the beach. We brought the 22 oz. variety that you might use to drink coffee from on your commute to work. The beach bar serves their drinks in plastic cups just slightly larger than an orange juice glass. And since this bar is on the opposite side of the palm grove from the water, it's not exactly convenient to get up and get a drink if you're lounging on the beach, not to mention that the drink you get is small enough to finish before you even get back to your lounger. So instead, bring your own mug and get them to fill that up. We were a little uncomfortable about this at first since we didn't see anyone else doing it, but the bartenders didn't have a problem with at all. And after the first day, we saw others doing it as well. Plus the insulated mugs have the advantage of keep frozen drinks frozen in the sun, and their covers keep all that sand out too. We're not big drinkers, but the mugs were well worth it, even for the casual amount of drinking that we were doing. One of the bars at the hotel hosts a nightly show. One night was a Michael Jackson impersonator, another night was a magician, one night was a song and dance show, etc. It's a good excuse to sit down and have a drink or two, but it's definitely nothing to write home about. If you're looking for some evening fun, take a cab down to 5th Avenue. It's a five minute ride, tops, and will cost you $4. This is the main tourist strip in Playa del Carmen and has all manner of restaurants, bars, clubs, and shops. We went down there on several evenings and always had a good time and never felt in the least bit unsafe. It's worth checking out at least once. A week wasn't long enough. We're already trying to figure out when we can get back to PdC. The RIU Palace was everything that we had hoped it would be, and we wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to someone looking for a little bit of luxury on the Mayan Riviera.", "Date": "December 27, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cOut of This World !!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "coxy29a", "ReviewID": "UR2945630", "Content": "My husband & I stayed at the Riu Palace Mexico from December 18 to December 25, 2004 and after reading countless excellent user reviews I can unequivically state that they were all on the money. Throughout the week we were constantly comparing everything with Secrets Excellence in Punta Cana, DR, where we stayed the same week last year and loved also, so I'll write this review in a comparative manner. Physical Plant: The Palace was just that and far surpassed the photos you see on the internet. Every surface on anything, was spotless and flawlessly maintained. One thing I read time after time was how slippery the tile/marble floors and walkways were and this was no exageration. I saw more than one person who had injuries too recent to have come from anything else but a fall there. I know it's tough to wash the floors and walkways at a time when there's no one around but certainly 8-10am when literally everyone is up and about, isn't it. Be careful! I'd give the edge here to the Riu although Secrets was gorgeous also. The Beach: The nicest and largest in the area, including the Royal Hideaway two hotels to the left if you're facing the ocean. The water was the clear, turquoise you see in brochures often but hardly ever encounter once you get there. Temperature was perfect and the combination of small waves in a calm sea made it perfect for swimming or just floating around. We spent 95% of our sun time there. In comparison with Secrets, the latter had a great beach also. Not as deep (this hotel is set way back and the sand started very far in, with many palm trees) but the biggest difference was in the amount of action on both. The Riu was really busy-lots of people, as it was shared by the other Riu properties nearby, para-sailing, speedboating, windsurfing, catamaran sailing, cruise ships docked nearby, etc. The Secrets beach was just perfectly peaceful with literally nothing happening. The water there was beautiful also but remember, it's the Atlantic not the Caribbean, so the water was not quite as blue or clear. For me I liked the peace and quiet at Secrets but my husband liked the sea at the Riu. Some of the nearby resorts had literally no beach when the tide ws in and I would have absolutely hated that. Food and Liquor: The food at the Riu was wonderful and the main eating place was Don Julian, the buffet, which we liked best. We went to two of the specialty restaurants, Sir Edwards and the new Japanese one which opened when we were there. I had to get up and be downstairs by 6:30 to get a reservation which is sheer stupidity when you're on vacation and for my money not worth the effort for a second, considering the vast anount of choices at the buffet. I also didn't like being tied in to a particular time to eat and at the Riu you had to choose an early or late seating. In this area, Secrets was far better as you could go to any restaurant at any time without reservations and the most that happened was that you might have to wait a few minutes to get in. You'd just have yet another drink! The liquor at both places was top shelf although Secrets might have a small edge there. I was amazed that at the Riu they had no good brandy, i.e. Courvoisier or Remy. If you wanted Don Julian tequila at the Riu they took out a bottle from under the bar-it was obvoius that they were discouraging anyone from seeing/wanting it. I usually drink Jose Cuervo Especial (sp?) but am ruined after the introduction to Senior Don Julio. All rooms were stocked with Smirnoff Vodka, Jose Cuervo, Bacardi Rum and a brandy I can't remember and didn't recognize. This was not an amenity at Secrets. The best bar at the Riu, by far, was the Cubano Bar and the best bartender, hands down, was Miriam who worked there every night. I really hope management recognizes her talent as she was totally efficient, friendly while being professional and used excellent judgement in every situation. If she were being secretly videotaped the higher-ups at this resort wouldn't ever find fault with her performance. She was an absolute pleasure, made the best drinks and was one of the high points of our visit. Rooms: At the Riu, were spacious, clean and well maintained but Secrets clearly had the edge here. Riu's bathrooms were adequate but Secrets' were gorgeous and every room had a two person jacuzzi which was great. Also, we stayed on the top floors of both resorts but Secrets' had cathedral ceilings which gave the feeling of much more space. Also, the latter was decorated nicer and had a much better TV with many more channels than the Riu. We didn't watch much TV but when we did there was a disappointing number of options. My husband, who's a real sports face, had to watch the football games in Spanish. Secrets also had better water pressure which was really bad at high usage times at the Riu. Gym & Spa- Secrets, hands down for both. It had a great, well equipped gym that was air-conditioned. The gym at the Riu was a joke and although I'm a workout nut I didn't bother at all for the whole vacation, ergo, the five pounds I gained. One guy we met at the Riu cabbed it to a place downtown to go to a gym there. Clientele: We, as Americans, were in the vast minority at the Riu, which is a chain owned by Spaniards and definitely caters to Europeans, especially Germans. This was certainly no problem for us and we met many lovely people. The one major problem for us, and it was a biggie, was the number of children at the resort. I had been reading reviews for a year and the impression was definitely, that although this was not an \"Adults Only\" place, there were very few kids due to the fact that there are no children's programs or much for them to do. The other Riu properties nearby, the Tequila and Yucatan, were much more kid friendly. I guess because it was Christmas, and visitors consisted mainly of families, there were many more kids than we anticipated and it was the only low point for us. Please don't get the impression we're anti-children. But, we don't have any and we had no fun sharing the formal bar with 8 year olds at 10.00 p.m. ordering milk shakes, or waiting 10 minutes to get a drink at the pool bar because kids were ordering every fruit smoothie they could think of and then leaving them because they didn't like them. We were told that, at other time of the year, when there were almost no children, that the ambience of the hotel was considerably different. So, it's just a matter of what you're looking for but consider this possibility if you'd be visiting when school is out. Pool: I'm not a pool person when the beach is as beautiful as it was at the Riu Palace. It was fine but nowhere near the calibur of the pool at Secrets. It is supposed to be one of, if not the, best in the Caribbean. The pool at the Riu was cold as was the jacuzzi, which drove people nuts. They should really do something about that. Secrets here, no contest. Service: Wonderful! Unlike most people we saw, we tipped. We probable went for a bit over $200. in a week and I wanted to give more. In my mind, \"All-Inclusive\" where \"gratuties are included\" just means you don't have to give them anything. It's not like they get any of what you give the resort above and beyond their tiny salaries. I saw everyone get great service and just don't understand how, that at the end of a 6 hour day at the beach with your party/family, sucking down endless drinks, you can't leave the bartender ANYTHING! A DOLLAR! Summation: This is a top notch, beautiful resort where, everyone we spoke with, said they had the best time. I don't think you will find a better place in that area, including the much touted Royal Hideaway. We were given a personal tour by the manager there, who was so gracious, that I'd consider staying there if everyone was half as accommodating as he was. However the Riu Palace Mexico was far prettier, the beach was twice as nice, and all of the restaurants at the RH were ala carte. We loved the buffet at the Riu. I like to see what I'm getting and get as little or much as I want and the quality of food and presentation was fantastic. The RH, however has the peace and quiet we would have loved as it only allows children over 13 and there were very few of those. The atmosphere couldn't have been more different, so, once again, it depends on what you are looking for in a vacation. I'll leave my e-mail address even though I'm probably risking hate mail on the kid thing! Feel free to ask questions.

I will discuss the hotel shortly but before I do I must discuss something that was a hot topic quite often amongst the guests. Playa Del Carmen is a very international tourist destination, primarily european based (probably around 65%-35%, Euros to Americans) though that seems to be changing since the word has gotten out around the states how awesome this place is. Anyway, this message is aimed mainly towards my German, French and Dutch sisters out there. I know that it is culturally acceptable to go topless to the beach where you come from but just because you can does not mean that you should. I assure you that no one wants to see overweight, out of shape women bare their saggy mammaries for all the world to see. It is highly offensive and pretty gross to be quite honest. Now before someone calls me a xenophobic, prudish American I am the son of a Greek immigrant and married to a Filipino woman. We hung out with Americans, Canadians and Europeans. I love all people. The beach at the RIU Palace is very multicultural and includes very young children. For the women who feel that I am just picking on them, your men are not much better. Euro men, I ask you, why do you feel the need to wear tiny bathing suits the cover nothing and accentuate big bellies and little assets? It does not look good. Decency, tact and class should be universal values shared by all. Trust me, my wife and I heard this common complaint from Brits, Yanks, Canucks, etc. Lets make this place the best it can be. I'm glad I got that off of my chest (pun Intended), now about the hotel. The RIU Palace is set in a gated community filled with all inclusives, condos, homes and a golf course called Playacar. It is adjacent to Playa Del Carmen. The topography and climate are very similar to South Florida. Pictures do not do this place justice, it is beautiful. The grounds are immaculate, the beach is awesome, water gorgeous and the rooms are nice. I can understand why people never leave the resort, but please see the sites and walk into Playa. The food is plentiful, too plentiful actually. It encourages gluttony. The food is good not great however. It is very rich and heavy and usually the same thing every night just packaged differently. After about four days my wife and I desperately craved Asian food. Good news, they're putting in a Japanese restaurant. Bad news it hasn't opened yet. I read complaints on previous posts about the lack of entertainment and activities for children. Hotel managemnet must read Tripadvisor because they had shows every night, most were quite good. One night their was a Michael Jackson impersonator. He was pretty good but the timing with Jacksons pedophile trial was a little questionable. Apparently the Saddam Hussein impersonator was not available that week. Their were plenty of activities always going on, salsa lessons on the beach, beach volleyball, darts, ping pong. All sorts of water soprts. I could go on and on but you get the picture. According to the people with kids (hi, Ken and Amy and daughter Rachel) there was plenty of stuff for the young ones too. Now my few very minor complaints, the pool was cold, not needed most months usually, but December is cooler. The jacuzzi is luke warm and closes at 7pm. We were hoping to have a pina colada at night in the jacuzzi like our honeymoon in Maui, oh well. On last thing the smoking is disgusting. Thank God I live in California where you can't smoke in public buildings. One show in particular we were sitting behind a man who was chain smoking and we couldn't switch seats because the showroom was full. He could have smoke out side, oh well. In summation this place is awesome. Go and have a great time.

My wife and I had room 2126 which is a Jacuzzi suite facing the ocean. Its the one on the north east corner. I tipped the front desk $10. and was moved there (after a minimal complaint) from one facing the courtyard.....that was the only thing that bothered me the entire stay....especially since I specifically reserved one with ocean-view. THIS is common and expected in Mexico at all HOTELS. NOW the room was nothing short of spectacular. Had towel swans with flowers on the first day then since we didn't tear them appart new towel animals popped up daily (chimp., elephant, heart etc.) and the flower petals on them were also changed daily with fresh ones. I left a $2 tip daily. I also peeked at some of the standard rooms for reference and they are all very nice. We had a gorgeous view of the pool and ocean from our 2nd floor balcony but after walking up the spiral staircase to the private Jacuzzy the view only got better, we could see Cozumel and the cruise ships. The Jacuzzi is great for two and private. The water is adequately warm...If you take a bath in the late afternoon its very hot, later at night, its still hot enough for a bath but not scolding. The service was impecable, an army of people clean the place non-stop. And between 8-10pm a towel lady stops by your room and gives you new towels if you need them and gets your bed ready for sleeping (flips the cover and puts hershey kisses on the pillow). The first night at 10pm she knocked on our door and yelled \"Toallas\". I thought it was a mistake and called the front desk to complain.... Dont make that mistake :) . I usually put a don't disturb sign on the door since we never needed new towels and wanted to avoid the disturbance....But if you have kids and need the towel service its great. The food was fantastic and above all expectations. Never even a hint of Montezuma and we drank \"iced\" drinks a common no no for Mexico. The best retaurants in my oppinion in this order: Sir Eduards - great lamb chops and other tasty menu choices El Patio - Good stakes. Don Julian - Self Serve Food..excellent. Reserve the place for the entire week for dinner the first night....ask them specifically or they wont do it...You dont have to show up for those reservations and if you ever sleep in you have a place to eat dinner guaranteed... La Bodega - 6 different meats. I was not impressed....They come by with the meat and slice it on your plate...the first two were stakes...ask for an xtra slice because the rest are turkey, chicken, pork and sausage which were on the dry side and not very good in my oppinion...but you decide as we all have different tastes and have been spoiled in life to different degrees. The 10pm shows were cute. They have very good dancers and put on a Grease musical, a Michael Jackson show, and a latin dance show. We met various couples there, from Canada and California and all seemed to have a great time. A couple from Canada did loose a diamond bracelet so use the safe there wisely... we did not experience any problems but I kept valuables in the safe and locked in my suitcase. As with any hotel you have to be careful. The pool was cool when the sun was not shinning but after a couple of tequila shots you wont care. :) Beach was great, water was warmer than pool and on windy days it was fun body surfing the waves. The croud is very international and if you want to go topless no one cares at the beach...and you wont be the only one. We took the hotel snorkeling tour and it was ok about 29$ We also rented a car from Budget for 23$/day and they have an office in the hotel=convenience. They'll bring you the car etc. Make sure you reserve online and show them the reservation receipt otherwise you may have to call the 800 reservation number to be believed. We went to Chichen Itza with it and Tulum as well as some of the Cenotes...Dos Ojos etc. Saved lots of cash that way. Overall one of the best hotels in Playa, you will cry when you have to leave.

It was very helpful in preparing for our trip. We stayed at the RIU palace from 12/3-12/10. We found a lot of what everyone said to be true. The resort is beautiful and very well maintained. The staff is very helpful and are very quick. Constantly cleaning every corner of the place, and drink service during dinner and at the entertainment area/bars is very fast. Meals were more than adequate at Don Julians. Tried Sir Edwards once, but got the lamb chops which were gamey. Would not recommend those. Don Julians was best for lunch too. Was not as excited about the El Patio/La Triviata lunch as much. I won't add a lot of detail but just summarize a few things I thought were useful tips. 1) The insulated mug was very useful for the beach because it is a decent walk to the beach bar. However, if you plan to stay by the pool, they had waiters constantly coming by to replace your drink so it was not necessary there. 2) We visited Xel-Ha during our stay. Nice place, but very expensive in my opinion if you get the all-inclusive (about $56 each). The basic plan was $29, and then you had to rent a towel, locker, and snorkel gear, and no food included I think either. We took a taxi there which was about $35 (ouch), but found out about the \"collectiva\" shuttle that goes back and forth on the main road from PDC to Tulum, etc. You can take a taxi to PDC for $4, pick up the collectiva in PDC and pick it up on the main road outside the entrance of XelHa on the way back. Cost was only like $2 each way. They go by every 10 minutes or so. Much better option, and we had the freedom to come back when we wanted to rather than get stuck in a tour. 3) We stayed in jacuzzi suite, which was nice in that you had an extra floor above that had lots of space and the jacuzzi. The room overall and the outside balcony are slightly bigger. But the jacuzzi (ie. large tub with jets) we only used once, and although is higher than most of the other floors in the resort, is open and you don't have very much privacy. We saw the other rooms and would stay in those which are more than adequate. 4) I would guess that there were about 60-70% europeans there or at least that many non-americans. I actually enjoyed it though. It's nice to meet people from different cultures and find out more about their countries and the way they live. 5) The resort is definitely adult-oriented overall. Majority of people were over 40 I would say, but everyone was very friendly. There were a handful of kids, but the staff really went out of their way to entertain them. There was a stage show every night which the kids participated in, and if anything they probably got more personal attention from the staff than they would have in a resort with a lot of kids staying at it. 6) The beach is absolutely the best I have seen. We have stayed in St. Thomas, Aruba, Bahamas, and Caymans, and the overall size and quality of the beach was fantastic. The water was nice, but I would say not crystal clear. 7) Entertainment - a mixture of some stage shows with dancers, \"fashion\" shows, and live bands playing nothing real exciting by american standards. But adequate to pass the time, and as long as you don't go in expecting Las Vegas quality entertainment, you won't be disappointed. The place does quiet down after the shows end at 11:00 pm. But if you stay on the one end where the sitting/eating area is and want to go to sleep before 11:00 pm, don't bother unless you're a heavy sleeper. Too much noise outside. 8) Went to Cancun for day. Took taxi to PDC, then bus to Cancun (very cheap and comfortable) and back. Definitely way to do it unless you are staying late past midnight. You can use the RIU Las Americas facility as well during your trip for lunch.

Food is fantastic and the buffet, well, if you get tired of the buffet, then you are just too picky! Hotel is in super shape and was beautifully decorated for the holidays. I travel to the Palace with hubby, relatives and friends often because I know the Palace will be a delightful place for everyone. I do recommend that if you have children, to book your stay at the other RIU properties (Tequila, Playcar, Yuacatan) because they are more child friendly with play areas and special activities. I find more Americans stay at the other properties because their children will meet up with other english speaking kids. As many times as I've stayed at the Palace, there have only been a handful of Americans. Realize, before you travel, that RIU is a european company and popular overseas, hence, many europeans stay at RIU properties and with that can come some culture shock. Sometimes, the Palace can seem like a retirement community, which is what the clientele of the Palace is looking for.

It was our first stay at a Riu property, and we plan on returning. All of the staff were very friendly, with a couple of minor exceptions. The food was really good in general. The buffet for breakfast was quite good, with several different stations. One for eggs made to order, great omelets, sausages, really good bacon, etc. One section seemed geared more to the European guests, pates, cold cuts, lots of yogurts, fruit, etc. There was a fresh juice station with lots of great combinations..banana and milk ? Delicious! My only complaint would be the coffee. Sometimes it was OK, others not so. We had similar-tasting coffee on a Princess cruise last fall, didn't taste fresh brewed, a pre-mix perhaps. LUNCH ! El Patio and La Traviata, located near the beach share the same pavilion, one side had primarily American fare, burgers, dogs, chicken etc., which we shied away from. Not that they didn't look good, we just wanted to have some thing different. la Traviata had a terrific selection of cold salads, meats, the olives were great. The hot station had fish, pasta, and a great carne asada. We tried not to over indulge! DINNER We dined at Sir Edward, one of the a la carte restaurants, two of our four nights. You must make reservatiions early AM the same day, if you want to get in. Crab Bisque and Yucatecan lime soup were excellent, and a nice touch was a plate of melon, jambon, and slices of a great parmesan (Reggiano?) for starters. A pretty decent Spanish Champag.... er, sparkling wine, was always available. The wine was surprisingly good, Chilean Merlot and Cabernet, Gato Negro, I may try to see if I can get it in the States. Grilled Red Snapper, lamb chops, beef tenderloin with mushrooms, and duck breast were the main course selections. We had all but the snapper, each was well prepared and served hot. Dessert was crepes suzette, peaches melba, or mixed fruit with honey. Cointreau and various other spirits were offered after dinner. We had the early seating @ 6:45. We never felt rushed. A pleasant dining experience indeed. Sunday night, we celebrated my wifes 40th birthday, and the staff made it special by singing to her and presenting an excellent chocolate mousse cake. Everybody in the restaurant cheered, and she was somewhat embasassed but very thrilled. Again, the staff at The Riu Palace are terriffic. We will be returning ! I will end it there.

We departed from Calgary and had no problems. Arrival in Cancun was very effortless and not one of our group got held up along the way. And don't be intimidated by other reports of the time-share \"sharks\" - there are lots of them, but you simply say no thank-you and keep on walking. Right outside the doors are your coaches and it was easy to discover which was ours, we just had to ask. Once everyone was loaded, we started off and the guide gave us a detailed description of what was to come (along with $2 Corona's!). The only disappointment on the trip to the resort was that it got dark early and we couldn't see the scenery, but it was beautiful arriving at the hotel in the dark. Everything was lit up and it looked spectacular! We did stop briefly at 2 other RIU hotels to drop off other guests, but these stops were short as most of the coach held our guests. Our first impression of the resort was nothing but fabulous - any pictures you see on the internet will not do it justice. The lobby is opulent and you feel like you've stepped into a 1950's movie set. The ushered us into a conference room, handed us a cold drink and check-in took no time at all. We went went to our rooms and then headed down for dinner. The rooms were also wonderful - they are large and have lots of wood, making them feel more luxurious. Only one room in our party was worrisom (slight chemical smell), so they moved us to a room with a better view and gave those guests our room. You do notice a bit of a smell in the rooms - but I couldn't say it was overpowering or unbearable. Having lived in the South Pacific for years, I have to say it was the familiar smell of humidity and you'll get used to it quickly. We moved to room 0051, which was a courtyard room on the bottom, at the end near the pool and beach. During the week, it was very quiet and we enjoyed the excellent service we had. We did tip $2-3 dollars each day and had towel animals and flowers on several occations - and they went all-out on the morning of the wedding. We had towel swans and hearts, flowers, lots of balloons and streamers, and they brought champagne, fruit and tequila while we we at the wedding dinner. The bathrooms are not as dark as mentioned in other reviews, and are actually very large. And we never had a problem with plugged drains or no hot water. Because that was our first night, we were able to attend dinner after we checked in and were not forced to wait for a seating time. This was to be the start of an excellent week of dining at Don Julian. Right off the bat - my Dad hit it off with Hernandez the maitre-de and the waiter for our section on the terrace, Johan (hola guys!) - and we were able to book that table for the rest of the week. It was gorgeous to eat in the open air each night, and the service is beyond anything you will see back home. After the first night, I never had to ask for wine - it was there seconds after I sat down. And you couldn't finish your glass without Johan there to fill it immediately. The food itself was excellent and there is so much selection - same with the alcohol selection. You could drink top shelf (which we did all week), or have great non-alcohol drinks (which my pregnant brides-maid did all week). Again, if you are not happy with the food or alcohol selection, then you have to be a very fussy eater! And although the resort was full while we were there, we showed up for dinner anytime between 6:30 and 10:00, and we never had a problem getting in or getting our table. We did tip Hernandez and Johan fairly well each night, so this may have been why. We did practice the dress-code and have to admit it was nice for us ranchers from the prairie to get dolled-up! Admitedly, we did wear jeans the first night and had no problem, although they did turn guys away in shorts later in the week. FYI - breakfast and lunch could be had at Don Julian's as well, or at the restaurant at the beach. The selection and freshness was always good. My husband and I never tried the other a-la-carte restaurants, but others in the group did and they were very impressed. And not one of our group got sick while we were there. The other thing to mention about the RIU Palace is the cleanliness and the exceptional staff. That resort is scrubbed, polished, mowed, raked and generally cleaned all day long. The common areas and beach are extremely tidy and you see people working at all hours. We did not see many bugs, but did see the large native hamster/rabbit-like animals and one small snake. And we never passed a staff member without a smile and hola. Even the front desk staff (who have been given a bad rap) were wonderful. If we had a problem or question, they were helpful to the end - especially Carlos! As for the rest of the week, we varied between lying on the beach and taking tours. The beach itself is wonderfully white and has both shaded and non-shaded areas, with heaps of lounge chairs. We did discover that Europeans do favour this resort and there were lots of topless women and men in thongs, but you do get used to it after the first day and are even tempted to try it yourself! The water was a bit rough the days we were there, but nothing unbearable and several of our group went pairasailing. The pool was a nice break from salt-water and we did thoroughly enjoy the swim-up bar and activities staff. The entire week, it varied between 30 and 36, so the weather was fantastic. We did manage to go fishing from Porto Adventuras one day, but because it was so rough, most of the two boatfuls got sick. But after the captain brought us land-lovers back, he did take out the few with iron-stomachs and they did manage to have a great time, catching a few barracuda and some benito. Tip to the wise, go on a very calm day! This was $45 US per person, and included transportation to PA and fishing for 5 hours. Not too bad of a deal. We went to Cancun on Wednesday to see the bullfights ($32 US), and most of us were fairly quiet coming home. It is something to see, but I think the beauty and tradition of the event was lost on most people, and some thought it extremely gorry. Glad we went, but probably wouldn't go again. My husband golfed at the Playacar course ($150 US plus $32 for clubs) and loved it. It was a bit pricey, but true golfers would enjoy it at least once - very narrow and challenging. Great scenery too! On Saturday, we took a cab ($10 US) to Xcaret ($50 US) and spent the day. There is lots to do and see there, but most things cost extra. We paid $28 US to go to the reef and snorkle for and hour, and it was worth it. Some in the group stayed for the night show and said it was the highlight of their trip. This tour could be booked through our Sunquest coordinator at the hotel, but we saved about $20 US by cabbing it there. During the week, others took tours to Tulum, a Cancun pub-crawl, Xel-Ha and swimming with the dolphins at PA. We would highly recommend taking the tours for some things, and doing it the \"local\" way for others. The tour coordinator can book most anything, but there is excitement in doing things on your own as well. The RIU Palace is in a \"gated\" community of other fancier hotels, golf course and private homes - which butts right against Playa del Carmen. You could take a $4 US cab ride right to 5th Avenue, or walk about 20 minutes. Both are safe to do at any time of the day, although their cab drivers are a little crazy! 5th Avenue was great and you can buy or do most anything. We felt very safe there and spent a few evenings ckecking out the night-life. Our wedding was held on Thursday and it was a perfect day. On the Monday, we had met with Mica our planner and she was very helpful. We picked the flowers, decor, trio of live music and completed the paperwork. Because we had to do blood-work, the doctor came right to our room and was very professional. On the wedding day itself, everything ran so smooth and it was an absolutely perfect day. We were married on the beach, with the water and boats behind us. The judge only spoke Spanish, so everything was translated - but in the end we received our certificate and were legally married! And we had a crowd the entire time! There were lots of hotel guests watching and cheering - which made the day that much more special. Hello to our new friends in Toronto and Connecticut! We went into Playa del Carmen for the dinner, but returned to the resort to enjoy the music and entertainment in the courtyard until it closed. We then went across the street to the RIU Tequila and hit the disco. When we left at 1:30 am, our 80 year-old grandma was still dancing up a storm! To sum up this very long review - this resort and area of Mexico are unbelieveable. We went to the sister RIU hotels and they are not near as fancy or clean, and their staff was not as professional. And there were few other resorts in Playacar that could match ours. Even the cab drivers told us we were staying in luxury! For the most part, our group are not wealthy or pretentious people, but it's easy to feel special and a bit snooty while staying at the Palace. Everything from the decor, to the service, to the quiet and peacefullness, to the other guests was perfect and we know we could not have had a more special wedding or trip. Our guests are still raving about their week and there were more than a few tears on the day we left.

The beach was absolutely beautiful my pictures will never do it justice. My husband and I would eat breakfast and lunch at the hotel and then go to Fifth Ave (about a two-minute cab ride) for dinner. Fifth Ave had everything from Italian to authentic Mexican dining, bars and shops. I could go on and on about everything but the bottom line is if you are considering going to Mexico and looking at the hotels. Stay at Riu Palace you can't go wrong. One last note though.....

Last year at the last minute we chose to visit Mexico as there aren\u2019t many areas to visit in Europe in November that can provide guaranteed sunshine. We stayed at the Riu Yucatan, which is situated next door to the Riu Palace both of which have direct access to the beach. We had no complaints at the 4* Yucatan, the standard of service is very good, the rooms are very comfortable and the place is exceptionally clean. Based on this we could only assume the standard at the 5* Riu Palace could only be better and this was proven to be the case. The service in the hotel is to an exceptionally high standard and all the staff are always eager to please. The place is cleaned continuously and the grounds are maintained to a very high standard. Our room number was 1091 which was of a good size and very comfortable including a separate seating area for TV viewing although the sofa was not very comfortable. We ate at Don Julian\u2019s (the main buffet) each night and found the food to be of a high standard with plenty of variation for different tastes. The main buffet at lunchtime is also very good with a much wider range of food than the restaurants down near the beach. The service at all the bars is exceptional and the range of drinks wide and varied although if you want the better known brands of spirits you have to specifically ask for them. Champagne is available, you must try a Kir Royale, which is a cocktail of Champagne and Cassis (excellent). There are a few minor things that the Riu management need to improve: - the Jacuzzi near the swimming pool needs refurbishing, $40 for losing a beach towel is ridiculous, more English TV channels would be good and a smiling senior management team wouldn\u2019t go amiss. Although you don\u2019t need to tip we took about $100 and gave tips over the course of our 2 week break to the staff that gave good service, after all they aren\u2019t paid a fortune. In summary if you want a quiet, relaxing holiday in beautiful surroundings with high standards of service then the Riu Palace is the place to go. P.S. When I say quiet this is with the exception of one or two of our American friends who tend to get on the noisy side especially when playing games or drinking a little too much. Have a great time.

Upon departure, your representative will be waiting for you in the lobby and they take you back to the airport.

This return trip met the high expectations created by our first trip. Again, I\u2019d like to say \u201cThanks\u201d to all of you who have posted before. It\u2019s has greatly helped me to make informed choices and also to stay excited about the trip back to PDC. We flew Continental non-stop from Houston, courtesy of frequent flier miles. The hotel and transfers were booked through Apple Vacations. It all went flawlessly. On the trip from the airport, one of the other passengers suggested some Corona\u2019s. The driver stopped at a 7-Eleven store and bought some beers for those who wanted. All were appreciative & he got a pretty good tip! Check-in was smooth, and we were offered our glass of juice as we waited. We arrived at 1:00pm, our room was ready, and the bellman took our bags there directly. It started raining a bit when we were unpacking. When the rain slowed, we went to La Traviata and ate lunch. The food and service were very good and this time, we didn\u2019t have any birds flying into the restaurant as we ate. This was very, very good! That first afternoon was the only time we had any rain while in PDC. I\u2019d written a couple emails to the Palace to again request a room with a solid wall balcony. We\u2019d requested and received one on our first trip, and loved it. It definitely provides extra privacy for sitting as well as sunning if one chooses. On the first trip, we were in Rm. 1147 which is on the north side of the resort and faces south into the courtyard. This trip, we had Rm. 1020 which also has the solid wall balcony. This room / balcony is on the south of the resort and faces south into the trees. The outside rooms are even more private than those facing the courtyard. We really enjoyed the quietness. I definitely recommend using room service each morning for coffee and juice out on the balcony. It\u2019s a great way to start your day!! The Sir Edwards restaurant opened just a few weeks after we went to the Palace the first time. Based on reviews read here, we tried it. It was a very pleasant dining experience. My wife\u2019s red snapper was great. My beef was very flavorful, but maybe just a bit tougher than it should have been. The service was excellent and the wine seemed to be a bit better than before. We were very pleased with the food at the Don Julian buffet. There was excellent variety and flavor in the food we tried. There was a \u201cpasta guy\u201d who cooked pasta to order, similar to the custom omelets in the mornings. We really enjoyed those pasta combos. On the \u201cdown\u201d side, it seemed like the service had slipped just a bit in Don Julians. On our first visit, we had the same waiter every night, and he was constantly refilling our glasses and tending to our needs. This trip, we had a different waiter / waitress every night and it seemed like they were serving a lot more tables. We often had to flag the waiters down to get a drink refill. Not a real big deal but it just seemed like a little less attention to detail. We again spent virtually all of each day at the beach. It was as beautiful as before, though the waves were a lot bigger this trip. We\u2019d get to the beach around 9 am and never had a problem getting lounge chairs under the palm tree of our choice. Beware, even in November, the sun is still strong! It seemed like more of the crowd at the Palace was from the USA this trip as opposed to May \u201903 when there seemed to be more Europeans. Unfortunately, the really loud obnoxious folks on the beach were Americans. Not sure why that was, nor why some folks thought they needed to be so loud, nor why they seemed to always find us. We walked south down the beach past the last resort. It is amazing how much that stretch of beach had changed in a year and a half. Enormous amounts of sand have washed in, creating additional beach. On our last trip, my wife took a picture of me on a big rock I had swum out to. After the picture, I dove off into 5-6 feet of water and swam back to shore. This trip, that rock (and the one a few feet from it) were ON the beach. We often hear of beach erosion. That stretch of Mexico has experienced beach expansion! We were looking forward to hearing David play the piano again in the bar off the main lobby. I\u2019d traded a couple emails with him because on our first trip after he had asked me to send the words to a song. After confirming our reservation a few months ago, I sent David a note and asked if he could learn to play \u201cRemember When\u201d by Alan Jackson. When we were there Friday night, I went and re-introduced myself. When he returned from his break, he played the song (which is my wife\u2019s favorite). It was a surprise for her, and nearly brought a tear to her eyes. David plays Mon-Fri nights until 9pm. He is excellent! If you\u2019re at the Palace, you owe it to yourself to spend an hour or so listening to him play. With a couple teens still at home, I\u2019m not sure when we\u2019ll be able to schedule more time away, but we will definitely return the Palace again.

First , let's begin with the beach. It was neat and best well-kept beach in the world. The waiters bring coconut and pineapple filled concoctions right to your lawn chair. The waiters were absolutely fabulous. We tipped the waiter one dollar for every drink he got us and the service got better and better every time. Most Europeans did not tip at all and their service was inferior. I, recommend that you tip one dollar for every drink and that will insure you will get great service. Now the restaurants; The buffet was absolutely the best. The theme restaurants are not worth waking up at six A. M. for. Stay in bed and enjoy your sleep and get the bartender to reserve it for you. For a tip he will reserve a seating for you. Noe, the night bartender, will get to what you want when you want and I mean, he will get you anything you want, anything. We went to check out the bars in the Sister hotels , and they are not worth the walk. Stay at the Palace , you will not regret it. But check for yourself you will realize that spending the extra money was well worth it. There are areas that were were inferior and do need some upgrading, but not crucial and no need to mention. People don't realize that you can use the sauna, Jacuzzi and athletic equipment in the gym at no additional cost. So don't forget to work out while you're eating all that wonderful buffet food. Topless women; the women at this beach were absolutely gorgeous and topless was the icing on the cake. My head was hurting after staring at these women for prolonged period of time as my wife was whacking me on the side of the head. Mind you , I am 39 years old and my wife is 29. But the women were worth the wacks. By reading this board , we were able to be better prepared of what to bring with us to the Palace. Take plenty of sunscreen , a hat, second skin shoes for snorkeling, and lots of T-shirts, if you're sensitive to the sun. The rooms; they are spacious well conditioned with hard beds. We had the view of grass and trees , and that was nice because it was very quiet. The safe was very useful to keep your valuables stored. The only obnoxious thing about this entire trip were my comrades, the Americans. They were mostly pompous arrogant and uncaring. I noticed that the Germans did not like the French. The French did not like English , and so on. But Americans were able to get along with all Europeans but not each other. The Iraq war was the biggest topic. Mind you , we were there and mid September and lots of other American GI's were getting killed. 5th Ave.; you have to visit this great street. Just to get it out of your system , but it is not that great. Other then it is a street that you can see and be seen , if you're young and like to party. This hotel housed , mainly couples and the single life would be very boring. If you can bring a significant other, do it. Just not your neighbors wife. Snorkeling; the best snorkeling is in Cozumel. Rent a moped for about $20 for the entire day and drive it along the island and find snorkeling places on your own. There are plenty of them. Taking the ferry to Cozumel was $35 and renting a moped was $20. Dinner was about $30 and drinks were about another $30. So it is safe to say that for about $100. You can have a pretty nice time in Cozumel. Everyone talked about bringing in a insulated cup. Don't bring an insulated cop , it is a waste of space and time, just tip the waiter and he will bring cold drinks every single time. My tipping budget was $20 per day. So we brought $200 in one dollar bills. We didn't use them all up for tipping. So we gave a lot of them away at the airport. Dress code; this is a pretty stupid code , as it is very hot and humid there. So men, bring lots of Hawaiian shirts They are airy and comfortable. Whatever you do is wear long pants to dinner. Otherwise you will not be eating. Stay away from parasailing , a woman was gravely injured while we were there. She must've suffered brain damage and felt very bad about that situation. Oh yes, I am a physician, orthopedist, but was not able to help this lady. Other then try and comfort her. Snorkeling and scuba diving at the Palace was affordable and enjoyable. The prices were very reasonable , and not worth going elsewhere to find it cheaper. I'm falling asleep trying to write this review. So there will be lots of typographical errors as my secretary is not here to correct them. I hope you enjoyed my review , and if you have any questions please feel free to e-mail me. By the way, if you get a chance look at the properties for sale. They are very expensive , but well worth their money.

It's a phenomenal hotel, so the question isn't if it's worth the stay (because it definitely is). The question is, what details should I remember to make it an even better stay at the Riu Palace. Stay in the 2100 block of rooms (3rd floor). It's definitely more quiet up top. Some might complain about having to climb a few flights of stairs, but hey, you'll be pigging out on the great food and should be working a bit of it off anyway. Tip because you want to tip, not because you want better service. The service at the Riu Palace will be great no matter what you do. Don't book any excursions/day trips at the hotel (or any hotel for that matter). Take the 3 minute walk to Plaza Playacar down the road and book your stuff at the travel agency there. You'll save at least US $20 per person per trip. I highly, highly recommend the cenotes at Hidden Worlds (about US$80). If you go, do yourself a big favour and buy an underwater camera with flash in advance. Try to avoid paying for things in US$. Convert to pesos and you'll save quite a bit of money throughout your vacation (e.g. most places go by the US$1 for 10 pesos conversion when it should really be 11 pesos - hey, believe me, it'll add up by the end of the trip).

First, I want to say, stop worrying, reading reviews, etc., you are going to have a great time. Yes, the showpiece of this beautiful, spotless resort is the beach! If you ladies are stressing over does your bathing suit make you look fat or can I really wear a two-piece, just go for it! It is amazing to see how people seem so comfortable no matter what shape their in. I think I only saw a couple one piece suits on the whole beach. Thanks to everyone who said bring an insulated mug, a must! Also throw an inflatable float in your bag, you'll want to have one and they charge 18 us dollars in the gift shop. I would caution against signing up for tours. We did Tulum/Xel Ha. Glad we did but we could have probably taken a cab to XEL-HA and been on our schedule. The bus is a drag. Luckily we were able to cancel our 2nd tour. The beach and pool were just too great to leave for a whole day! Personally we thought Sir Edwards, La Traviata and La Bodega (a lot of meat) were okay. They do break up buffet eating. The food is good, fresh, with an incredible selection. It may get a little tiresome by the end of the week, but you will not go hungry. This is such a beautiful resort, I hate to be negative but I did not love the room. It smelt very musty, so an airfreshner is a must. The towels never felt really fresh and clean. But they do a very good job cleaning it, it'll be fine. Might be a good idea to upgrade your room, if possible. Mostly I want to say tip the staff! Bring us dollars and pass them on freely.

I am sooo glad we picked this resort! After reading everyone else\u2019s reviews of this resort I had to offer our comments regarding the Palace. Cancun Airport: While our arrival was not as bad as anticipated, our departure was a nightmare. They have non-random screening at the ticket counter where they only pull the first 3 people in line for their return tickets aside and hand search every item. Unfortunately, this turned out to be my husband and I and we ended up being the last people to check in and didn't get seats even near each other! Front Desk: Check in was a breeze although we arrived at 8pm. We were offered a drink as soon as we got into the hotel. Our room was exactly what we had requested through our travel agent and our bags were delivered to our room very shortly after we got into it. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful when we had questions. Room: We stayed in one of the 8 jacuzzi suites that overlooked the ocean. Beautiful room with a nice marble bathroom with two sinks, a sitting area with couch and chair, and even a full walk in closet area with shelves. We had 2 patios, one that you could walk out onto from the room with a few chairs, and the other was above the room with a private spiral staircase to it. The Jacuzzi was on this patio that had a breathtaking view of the pool and ocean. This resort only offers two beds pushed together instead of a single queen or king. We were expecting the beds to be hard, and they were, but we didn't find this a problem at all since we were so exhausted each night. Mattress pads could be requested from the front desk. Grounds: As everyone else has mentioned, the grounds were immaculately kept. There seemed to be an army of people out early every morning attending to it. I would caution that the floors become VERY slippery if at all damp/wet so make sure you are careful. Beach: I can\u2019t say that I have been to a nicer beach in my travels. The sand was pure white and so soft. There was not a hint of garbage or seaweed anywhere. I believe the beach is combed every day or so to keep it clean from debris. When you walked into the ocean, you could feel nothing but sand and see right down to your toes. We even had a few fun days where the water was a bit choppy and had a blast riding the large waves! We also never had a single problem finding a lounge chair at any time during our stay. Plenty of room and shade or sun! Pool: We spent a great deal of time at the pool. It was nice and large so you weren\u2019t bumping into others. It also had seating around the edge to just relax and sit in the pool. The pool also had a swim up bar with water cascading down from the top. While the service was a bit slow (and yes, we tipped generously) I can\u2019t complain about being able to drink while being submerged in the cool waters. Directly outside the pool was another nice pool bar that served snacks and had shaded seating. The towel exchange is also located around here for you to get clean pool towels. Service: I really can\u2019t complain about the service. I won\u2019t say it\u2019s the best service I\u2019ve ever received, but these people do work extremely hard to make the guests happy. Drinks were always offered while at any of the bars or dinning areas. The ashtrays never sat dirty for more than a few minutes, and the staff was very friendly. The only area that I would suggest was a bit uncomfortable was at Don Julians. According to the \u201crules\u201d at your first dinner you were to be seated in your permanent spot for your entire stay. Unfortunately, we were told every single time we ate there that we were in someone else\u2019s seat. We would have to move tables in the middle of our meal every time that we ate there. Not a huge deal, but was a little inconvenient for us. Overall: We really had a wonderful trip here and would come back in a heartbeat. This was one of the few vacations that I\u2019ve taken where I was sad to go home. I hardly ever felt the need to leave this resort because I had everything I wanted right there. This resort is a very low key at night so please stay elsewhere if you are looking for an all night party. I also probably wouldn\u2019t recommend this resort if you have young children. While they do have a kids program every night, this resort tends to be more for adults who are looking for rest and relaxation. One thing I didn\u2019t discuss in this review was the food. I felt it wasn\u2019t necessary to go into that since everyone has different tastes and there have been plenty of others who have commented on it.

The restaurant is very elegant and the crab bisque, pork and duck was so delicious which are foods I normally would not order. La Bodego was good and the restaurant is romantic but not to repeat because the buffet offers so much more and is again, soooo good. The staff is so friendly and attentive. The service could not have been any better. Our room was well kept but we did leave a $1 tip daily. The maid turned down our beds in the evening but I don't know if everyone had that or if our $1 gave us a little extra attention. The tropical drinks were very good and quite lovely presented. However, the drinks by pool side and beach were not that good. I recommend you take a cup with you that keeps your drink cool and just take it up to the Cuban Bar and have them pour your drink in it. That way your drink stays cooler as you are outside and you have a bigger cup so it will last you longer. Gorgeous beach. The water is so clear you can see your toes. The sand is super soft and lots of it. However, I didn't realize that Playa de Carmen had so many resorts built on it and they are so close together.

This was the first time I was ever out of the country so I will give you all the things I learned so those also making the venture for the first time will be prepared. For those wanting a quick summary of the tips, I have made them at the end. We went with Apple Vacations mostly because my company uses them frequently, but in retrospect we are glad we did. Their service was great. Getting There: The flight in was relatively uneventful. We were flying from Philadelphia so the trip was only 3 hours. From the US you can go to Mexico with 2 different forms of ID, Passport or Birth certificate with Photo ID. We were going to go with our birth certificates at first, but at the last minute decided that it would be better to get passports. From my observation, people with passports had an easier time and it also took less time for them at the custom windows. Two people were denied (before we left Philadelphia) boarding. One was a woman whom had a birth certificate with her maiden name and ID with her married name. All those honeymooners beware. Make sure you have like ID. The other was a family with an adopted child. Not sure exactly what the problem was, but if you are going with an adopted child, make sure you double check. On the plane we were given two forms to fill out (make sure you have a pen). These are standard forms of who, what, where, and why. When you land at Cancun airport you will be bussed to the terminal and enter the customs area. This can take a while depending on how many people there are. Luckily we were close to the front of the line (about 20th) and it only took us about 15-20 minutes to make it through the first window. Continue to the baggage claim and get your bags. After you have everything you go through the last checkpoint for customs. The stoplight. It\u2019s easy. You push the button, green you go, and red you are stopped and checked. They say it\u2019s random, but I doubt it. As you are walking out of the airport, there are kiosks of people for rental cars and god knows what else. They will try to hound you. If you already have transportation set up or with Apple (or any other vacations) just look straight ahead and keep walking. When you finally get outside, again there will be people trying to take your bags to transportation. It\u2019s very confusing and scary if it\u2019s your first time. I practically had to intimidate a guy who had my bag in his hand to let go. Just make sure you see ID of the person who is supposed to pick you up because there are a lot of people who try to look like your tour/travel company. If you are going Apple, the Apple busses are down a little bit to the left. They will have your name on the bus manifest so you can make sure it\u2019s for you. There: The bus ride there was pretty uneventful. We were the only ones going to the RIU Palace and we were the last stop of about 5 stops. It took altogether about an hour. The bus guide was trying to entertain the busload of weary travelers and did have some of us laughing. He went round robin and asked each of us where we were staying. When we said the RIU Palace, he gave us this weird look and said, \u201cThey have good coffee there\u201d. At this point we were a little nervous that our hotel invoked such a reaction. One of the things we noticed was that there were numerous police checkpoints on the route. After everyone, besides us, left the bus, the bus guide came over to us and sat down. He asked us what made us pick the RIU Palace. I told him I researched it on the web, mainly trip advisor and it seemed like the best place to go. He nodded to me. I asked him if there was something wrong with the place. He told us that he had been working in the industry 10 years and that this is the only hotel that has left him speechless. He told us it was the best resort out of all of them including the surrounding towns. He explained that he couldn\u2019t tell me that earlier with everyone on the bus because he was suppose to stay professionally neutral. When we pulled up to the resort he actually went in with us to see it again. The Hotel: We walked into the lobby and it was really nice. Our check in, although early, was really smooth. We each got welcome drinks while checking in. We went to our room (#19). It was spacious. The view wasn\u2019t the greatest off the back patio, but we didn\u2019t care. It was a little musty from the humidity, but not that bad. We began to test everything in the room. The fridge was filled with numerous sodas and beer. Above that was a runner with Tequila, Rum, Vodka and Brandy. The closet space was nice and so was the bathroom. The beds were firm, but since I like firm beds I found no problem with them. The only two \u201cproblems\u201d I found with the room was that the lights did not get bright enough and the a/c didn\u2019t get cold enough. It was manageable, but in a perfect world they would be the only things I would change with the room. We decided the first thing we would do is to look around the whole place briefly just to get our surroundings. We went out into the courtyard and we almost fell to our knees. The beauty of the center courtyard was something we never saw before. Fountains, nicely landscaped\u2026 just breathtaking. We walked through the courtyard to the pool area, again stunning, then to the beach. The water was a beautiful turquoise, the beach was not too crowded and there were many people sailing, wind surfing, and swimming in the water. The skyline of Cozumel could be seen off in the distance. It was the first day and we were already in love with the resort. Where do you eat? The most confusing part of our trip was figuring out where the heck to eat. The map of the hotel they give you is not right and mostly in Spanish. We had a hard time figuring out where to go. So you won\u2019t waste time figuring it out, here is how it works. You need reservations for every restaurant for dinner. The first night you arrive you do not need reservations at their main buffet Don Julian for dinner. While you are eating, the maitre D will come to you and reserve Don Julian every night for the rest of your time there. So if all else fails, you can eat there for dinner. They have a dress code at all of the places to eat for dinner. Don\u2019t go grabbing your Sunday best though. I was fine with black jeans, a nice shirt, and sneakers. The only place you don\u2019t have a dress code is La Triviata for lunch. You can come in your swimsuit if you want. The food is good. Don Julian is a buffet with many different choices. The specialty restaurants are Sir Edward, La Bodega, and La Triviata. Sir Edward is a fancier a-la cart place. They have soup, salad, appetizer, main course, and dessert. They have things like chicken, duck, fish, lamb, and beef on the menu done in different ways. La Bodega is the Brazilian style place. You start off with a salad bar, and then they bring out a skillet of roasted vegetables. Then every 5 minutes or so, they come out with a different meats and give you a piece. It was very good. La Triviata was a Steakhouse/ Mediterranean grill. It wasn\u2019t too bad. We had steak and salmon. The steak was tasty, but not like steak in the states. You may be a little disappointed. As for recommendations, they were all good for dinner. La Triviata was my favorite for lunch. Not only is it open later, but also I enjoyed the food there more. Not too mention being able to be nice and casual. Water: The pool was nice. It is in 2 big wavy half circles. The deepest it gets is about 4 feet. One of the half circles has a swim up bar in it. Where the bar is though is only about 2 feet deep. The swim up bar was nice. In the center of the 2 half circles is another patio bar with some snacks. Early in the day, it is pretty easy to get a chair close to the pool. One trick that a British couple we met there did was bringing their own towels from home and keep them on their chairs they liked. They do have waiter service to the pool chairs, but it is often slower then just walking the 10 feet to the bar. My only 2 complaints about the pool are that there were no deep areas, nor any stretches of straight pool to actually swim laps. Again, a very minor complaint. The beach was nice. I recommend going early. Though getting a chair was never a problem, the beach can get a little crowded. The water was cool and the beach was beautiful. Nothing in the water. No seaweed, no jellyfishes, not many shells, nice and clean. There are topless bathers and the bar is a little distance from the beach. Bringing your own big insulated mugs (as suggested here) was definitely a plus. There is enough open beach for those that want to tan to do so, however there is a large shaded area of the beach too for those that don\u2019t want as much sun. There were a few vendors around, but nothing annoying. I was there 7 days and only got asked twice to buy something. Town: We decided that we shouldn\u2019t just stay on the resort the whole time, but that we should experience the town of Playa Del Carmen. We caught a taxi (no shuttle) to the town and it was about $4USD. We began to walk 5th avenue (the town\u2019s hot spot) and were immediately hawked by the various vendors. We did this about 5 blocks and did go into 2 stores that no one hawked us into but decided it just wasn\u2019t worth it to stay. We caught the next taxi back and stayed at the resort the rest of the time. We went in the late morning. The British couple went into town in the evening and said it wasn\u2019t as bad as we had it. Perhaps it depends on what time you go. If you don\u2019t need to buy anything and aren\u2019t interested in the touristy \u201cSenior Frogs\u201d I would advise skipping the town. Money: As most of you know, Mexico uses the Peso but the US dollar is king there. Things are cheaper if you use the dollar. You will see sales like \u201c20% off but 40% if using USD\u201d. The tricky thing is, that you need to bring all the USD you want to use because there is nowhere to get USD once you are down there. There is no ATM in the resort. There is a little mall-like plaza about a 5-minute walk from the hotel, but it only dispenses pesos. Pretty much everywhere takes Visa/MC but it may give you some stress. Was that 200 pesos they just charged to your card or 200 dollars? When you find out, it will be too late. We brought cash, a MasterCard and an American express traveler check card. I would advise against the traveler check card. Sure it\u2019s secured in case it gets stolen, but hardly any place takes American Express. Also we had a situation where the card was charged with something then it was cancelled. It took a week (well after we were home) for that money to be re-posted on the card. Summary: The trip and hotel was superb. The staff was attentive and pretty much everyone knew English. Out of all the resorts I saw down there\u2026 this was most definitely the nicest. I would go back here in a heartbeat. Put all your worries aside, if you vacation here you will live in the lap of luxury, even if it is only for a week. Tips: Some tips that you may want to have if you stay here. 1.Bring an insulated mug. It saves the trips back and forth to the bar. 2.Bring a lot of sunscreen. It is very expensive down there and the sun is really strong. 3.Drink water. I know it sounds common sense, but I don\u2019t mean a bottle a day. Especially if you are drinking. We saw many people pass out. A method we used was drink water with meals then alcohol at the other times. Dehydration is rough. 4.Get the later dining time. We like to eat earlier but we ending up skipping lunch almost every day because we wouldn\u2019t be hungry for dinner. 5.Bring some Pepto, Advil, etc. Medicine, though you can get prescription over the counter there, is very expensive. It\u2019s better to pay $2 here then $15 there. 6.The drinking water on the resort is A-OK! Elsewhere, beware! 7.Since the sun is so hot, try to live like the Mexicans do. Try to keep all your outdoor activities in the morning and early evening on. Between noon and 4 gets really hot there, take it easy. 8.Bring USD. 9.They have no diet non-carbonated drinks other then water. If you want something else, bring a little ice tea mix or lemonade. 10.The water in the bathrooms is NOT filtered. Brush your teeth with the bottled water and when taking a shower, keep your mouth closed. 11.The TV there is pretty crappy. Not that you will be watching much, but you may want to bring a game or some cards. 12.This is not a good kids resort. There weren\u2019t many kids there, but this place is definitely skewed for adults.", "Date": "September 8, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huntsville, Alabama", "Title": "\u201cRiu Palace is the best!!!\u201d", "Author": "Bamafun", "ReviewID": "UR2515327", "Content": "Just returned from a great week at the Riu Palace! The hotel is as beautiful as everyone says. The hotel staff was extremely friendly. The beautiful beach was definitely the highlight of the trip. We arrived at the Cancun Airport on Saturday at 10 am. Had no hassles going through customs, got our baggage, and headed outside. Ignore all of the people who will try to call you over as you leave the airport. We booked with Apple, and headed outside the airport and found the Apple rep in a flowered shirt. We boarded a 12-passenger, airconditioned van and headed for the Riu. We were the first passengers dropped off, and arrived at the hotel at noon. Our room was ready (on the 2nd floor near the pool), we unpacked, had lunch and hit the beach. The beach is beautiful white sand, plenty of shade under palm trees, and the water was the most beautiful blue I've ever seen. We brought insulated mugs, which kept our drinks cold all afternoon. During the week we took 2 tours - one to Chichen Itza and one was a Mayan Adventure snorkeling tour. Chichen Itza is worth doing once in your life, but it's a long bus ride. Be careful climbing the pyramid. We saw someone fall, and suffered multiple injuries. The snorkel tour was fun for beginners. Next time, we'll book with Scuba Caribe rather than Apple for the snorkel tour. Scuba Caribe is right on the beach in front of the Riu Palace. The weather was sunny and hot every day. It rained on our last day as we were waiting to leave. The buffet restaurant was good - be sure to go there for the Chef's Gala night. We also enjoyed La Bodega and Sir Edwards. The El Cubano lobby bar is a great place to relax prior to dinner. We never stayed up for the shows, which started every night at 10 pm -- too exhausted from the sun and surf! We will definitely be returning to the Riu Palace and PDC. Be sure to go to the town of PDC to shop. However, we found the prices at the small shopping area in Playacar were better than in PDC.

As stated in the previous reviews, the resort is breathtaking. We have stayed in several other 5* resorts in the Playa del Carmen / Puerto Morelos area & the RIU Palace far surpassed the others. We were looking for a nice stress free relaxing vacation & since we used this web site extensively to do our research, I thought I would provide our experiences as well. Positives: The beach: Unbelivable! All the outstanding reviews regarding the beach were one of the main reasons why I selected the Riu Palace. We are beach lovers & this beach did not disappoint! The water was crystal blue & very warm with fine white sand on the ocean floor as well as on the beach. This is one of the best beaches I have ever been to. The fact that there was no pressure to scramble to the beach early in the morning to \u201creserve\u201d a lounge chair was a big plus. You could get there ANY time of the day & have a great location either in the shade under all the swaying palm trees or in the sun. Very nice! Service: Outstanding! Again, as all the other reviews stated, the service is top notch. The employees are always there with a friendly Hola! & a smile. If you sit back while enjoying a show, watch the employees. You will see them actually running back & forth to get the guests their drinks. It was amazing how hard they actually work. You will see the same employees working at 7am & still serving guests at 11pm. They work VERY hard. Room: The room was very nice & well maintained. There was a very slight musty odor when we first entered the room but you are in the Tropics & it is to be expected. The balcony had a view of the neighboring RIU resort & a 5 foot cement wall so you could not sit down & enjoy any view since all you could see was this wall. When we first saw this upon entering the room, we asked if we could have a room with a nicer view with a wrought iron rail so we could actually utilize the balcony. We were told by the desk if we wanted to spend an additional $50 a day we could change rooms. I did not understand this because the resort did not seem to be full? The beds are firm, but after a day on the beach & a couple cocktails, we had no problem sleeping at all! Food: Very good! We ate at all 3 reservation restaurants, the main buffet Don Julians, as well as the lunch buffet (El Patio) & never experienced a bad meal. This is another area were the Palace distinguishes itself from the other all inclusives we have stayed at. The buffet was delicious & changed nightly depending on the theme so it never got repetitive. The buffet offered a wide variety of foods not to mention roasted duck, beef Wellington, & other upscale selections you usually do not find on a buffet. The reservation restaurants were all very good as well. I highly recommend them all just for the service & the experience. The only restaurant that was difficult to get reservations for was Sir Edwards. We were up early Sunday morning to go into town for Church so we were able to get in. It is first class all the way & worth getting up a little earlier one morning to get in. Weather: The weather was gorgeous the whole week. Not a drop of rain fell. We learned the first time down not to stress over the weather reports. They are seldom correct! Small Disappointments: These negatives are very slight & really did not cause any major issues but thought they would be good to include. Room: The shower did not work the first night so we had to bath & wash our hair under the faucet. We told the desk on the way to dinner & it was repaired by the time we returned from the show. The bed had no bedding on it 2 nights out of our stay? I am not sure what was going on but we had to call the desk one night because we had no bedding & we had to make our own bed one night because the bedding was there but piled on the closet floor? We also tipped the maid daily & never received any towel animals or bed turndown service? No big deal but when you read all the reviews & are expecting these little touches it is a little disappointing when you do not get them. Desk Service: We requested the front desk to give us a wake up call so we could get to 8am mass downtown but never received any call. Strong Pungent Odor: There were several areas at the resort that had a very strong stomach turning smell. I do not know what it was but was very strong. It smelled like someone had been sick, but since it was there the entire week of our stay I do not think that was the cause. As you can see the positives well outweigh the negatives & we would not hesitate to return to the Palace. We were looking for a very relaxing stress free vacation & found it. The Palace is an outstanding resort & was worth every penny!

It never ceases to amaze us to read negative views. This was our 51st trip to the Caribbean, and we return to the Riu Palace as we find it an incredible property. It is obvious to us that many people do not research before they travel. The Palace does offer activities for children, but the other Riu hotels have a more extensive program for them and advertise that fact.. Not wanting to be rude--some people do not enjoy the flurry of activity of hundreds of children, that is why some hotels offer activities for them, and others are more limited. As far as the food at the Palace--I cannot imagine anyone going hungry at this hotel. Every imaginable type of meat is served EACH night, along with a variety of fish and seafood dishes, as well as an entire Mexican section in the buffet restaurant. On top of this, individual cooking stations were in constant motion. Yes, the 3 other restaurants require reservations due to smaller size. Just like anywhere in the world, restaurants fill up, and you must try again. In our two weeks at the hotel, we did not get a reservation only once, and some nights, the restaurants were not full. People not preferring the buffet restaurant can have lunch in the open air Italian and Mexican restaurants, both serving a multitude of dishes. The hotel is even more beautiful than when it was first built, and it is kept impeccably clean. The ground are among the most manicured we have ever seen. Regardless of what some reviews state, there is entertainment EVERY night, and frequently, as well as these shows, music is played in the courtyard outside of the restaurants where you can sit and have drinks before the show. Many people take advantage of the dance floor as well. The staff, from bartenders to cleaners to the dive shop and the front desk personnel are very accommodating. Perhaps people who do experience problems are being rude and obnoxious--trust me we have seen some extremely rude people at resorts over the years !!! We certainly have no reservations in recommending this hotel, and have booked a winter trip to the Rui Cabo San Lucas opening in December. We have stayed at Westins Hotels in the Virgin Islands, Sandals in St. Lucia, and Lido resorts in Jamaica and find the Riu resort much better, and a bit cheaper as well.

I was a bit apprehensive about going to Mexico (water/food & after being spoiled at 5 star all-inclusive resorts all over the world.) I was pleasantly surprised by what the Palace and Playa del Carmen had to offer. Reviews/ Info The food was very good in all the restaurants but not incredible. The desert was so-so. The entertainment was amusing at best. Go to town (5th street it's a great time) Get an egg crate for your bed to make it softer and it'll be fine. The rrom is large and sunny. Use bottled water to brush your teeth. The pool was small but enough. The pool and beach bar close at 6pm. the pool closes at 8pm, and you can't swim in the ocean at night. If you do early morning tours or rise before 9am you will have NO problem getting reservations to any of the restaurants. The service was the best I ever experienced, they clean constantly (they even painted part of our room while we were out). The beach was perfect w/ soft clean sand and crystal blue water (you can use snorkel equiptment, boogie boards, kayaks, wave runners, etc....) If you plan to spend alot of time at the beach then definitely bring thermoses for your drinks. They have a pottery painting (extra $) by the beach, they come out great but to paint them takes more time then you think...make something small. Tours: You can't wear bug spray or non-biodegradable sunscreen on these tours. And at the Mayan ruins it is VERY hot, prepare to sweat a lot!!! 1. The best tour was called Altournatives. You got to really see the Mayan people and culture in the jungle. It's the only tour allowed in so close. You visit and climb the ruins, eat a traditional Mayan lunch, go rappling and zipping threw the jungle, swim in a canote... It was an all day tour from about 7am -6pm. 2. Tulum and Xel-Ha: We saw the only ruins near the water, and then went to a natural aquarium. we snorkeled and saw soo many huge and small fish, they were everywhere! We also did a Sea Trek where we wore weighted helmet and walked on the bottom of the water and got real close and personal w/ the sting rays and fish. You can also cliff dive and relax on tubes down a river. 3. Swim w/ the dolphins at wet and wild in cancun. We got kisses, danced, pet them and got launched in the air by them. It was great! You can buy pictures and a video. Playa del Carmen: Its a great place to shop, eat, and go to bars. We went several times and still couldn't get enough. Great bars= The Moon, OHM Cancun: We rented a car for $65 for 24hours and drove to cancun. 45 minutes- 1 hour. Its only one straight road, but has no lights at night. Great bars, especially senior frogs!!! I recommentd the restaurant in the Hyatt Hotel for dinner and dessert. (Flamming coffee and crepes were the best!!!) If you have any quest. feel free to email.

I hope that my experience can enlighten some future guests of the Riu Palace. My family stayed here for 10 days in early August 2004. We are two women, ages 43 and 45, and two teenage boys, ages 17 and 18. I booked this vacation about 9 or 10 months in advance, so I expected all of our ducks to be in a row by the time August rolled around. We reserved two of their \"Jacuzzi Suites\", of which there are only eight in the whole resort. Even on the day of our arrival, our travel agent was told that there were no changes and those suites would be our accomodations. Thus we were quite surprised to complete the entire check-in process and then be told \"By the way, you are only getting one Jacuzzi Suite\". How could that be? We reserved and paid for two of them months and months ago?? No real explanation was given; they just blamed it on \"overbooking\". This was both lame and insulting to us. Speaking with management and our travel agent got us nowhere. The two boys ended up in a junior suite THAT WAS NOT EVEN ON OUR SAME FLOOR. That was the real kicker. And, here we are a month later, and they have still not issued us a refund for the price difference on the rooms. The Jacuzzi Suite turned out to be not such a big deal. It is on a beautiful seperate patio that is accessible by spiral wrought-iron staircase on the balcony, but it is only a bathtub type of thing (with jets...). No biggie. We used it once in 10 days. Just let this be a warning to future guests. They will bait and switch you without batting an eye... That being said, the Palace is clean and beautiful. Beach and ocean are gorgeous. Tons of palm trees and always plenty of beach chairs. We enjoyed the food, and found the nightly buffet to be easier than the restaurants that require reservations. We went to the steak house one night and it was way too hot to sit outside, no matter what time of the evening... One tip, mainly for adults. If you want to find a much more secluded and quiet beach spot, walk out to the Riu beach, and turn right. Walk ten minutes or so and all of the resorts end. There is a wonderful stretch of sand to lay on, and beautiful trees up further away from the water (because there are no buildings there). No chairs, but all you need is a towel and a book, and you get peace and quiet away from the crowds. We did this a number of times. Perfect also for swimming or floating in the incredible Caribbean Sea... The staff works very hard, so please bring money for tips. They are not paid enough for their labor. I brought $200 u.s. dollars in singles and it was not enough. We tipped maids, bartenders, bus boys etc. It means a lot to them and they deserve it.

It is beautiful and kept spotless. The staff is incredibly friendly and respectful, and it is sometimes amazing how many languages they can speak.

The main buffet restaurant don julians was excellent ,there was always a choice of everything you can think of, vegetable dishes, meat dishes, cold cuts, fruit, cooking stations the choices were endless and they have theme nights such as chinese, italian, carribean which are all very good and just add to the variety. Sir edwards gourmet restaurant is also excellent. The only bad about the food was la bodega the brazillian steakhouse, in england we like our meat well done generally but in here its virtually running around the plate! this is a warning to any english travellers to stay away! i appreciate we are a minority and many other countries serve their meat in this manner but as i say i have written this not as a insult but just to warn the brits!!

Another highly reccomended trip is the catamaran cruise you go for half a day on the boat get to snorkel, sunbathe,and eat lunch and drink from the free bar (after you snorkel!)very enjoyable.The only thing i found monotonous about the palace was lack of evening entertainment, after the show fineshes at about 11o' clock there is only the bar cubano which is like a piano type bar very nice but only for a very quiet drink,we went to the disco at the riu tequilla across the street several times but this we found to be very rowdy and rather like a cattle market!! it was ok but a bar that played louder non piano music would have been better! I would reccomend the riu palace in a instant it is a true 5 * resort and we do hope to return here in the future again it was a lovely relaxing very memorable holiday.", "Date": "August 27, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lynchburg, VA", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice Honeymoon\u201d", "Author": "melvins138", "ReviewID": "UR2494113", "Content": "My wife and I spent our honeymoon at the Riu Palace Mexico in late May 2004. We overall really enjoyed the place. General Info: Our trip was May 23-30, 2004. The Riu Palace Mexico is located about 45 minutes south of Cancun, in Playa del Carmen, which is the port town for Cozumel. Playa del Carmen is a small town, and most of the tourist areas are very full of shops and sellers. Arrival: The resort was beautiful, very well maintained. The check in staff was very courteous and friendly. There was no wait, and getting into the room took only minutes. The floors were marble, with chandeliers and plush couches all around. Well dressed and mannered staff greet you and take your bags to your room The Room: The room was large, neat and clean, divided up into bathroom, bed area, and lounge area. There was a stocked mini bar containing Corona, Pepsi, Pepsi lite (diet), 7\u2022Up, orange soda, mineral water, bottle water, rum, vodka, brandy and tequila. The beds were two full size beds bolted together, and made up like two separate beds. This was kinda odd. They were a little on the hard side, which is not a complaint, but be aware if this is not your preference. There was a 19\" tv, with satellite, with about 7 English speaking channels. The tv was located in the lounge area in the room. The bathroom was large enough for two people to be in at once, with the toilet and bidet being in a separate closed off area. The shower was adequate for one, but showering together required some maneuvering. Our room was close to the beach and on the first floor, which was nice. We never heard any of our neighbors, but the cleaning staff was loud during the days. The Food: The food was very nice in every restaurant in the resort. The review is divided up this way; breakfast, lunch and dinner. Breakfast: Breakfast was held in the main dining hall, \"Don Julian.\" It's a typical American buffet breakfast. You had your choice of eggs, made to order omelets., bacon, sausage, toast, bagels, cereal, fruit. We saw a wide variety of Fruit juices, orange, apple, pinapple, watermelon, etc. Also available were a selection of coffees, teas, and mimosa. Lunch: Lunch was offered at \"Don Julian,\" \"El Patio,\" and \"La Traviata.\" El Patio and La Traviata are outside open air eateries. Lunch was good, nothing special. We preferred Don Julians only because it was indoors and air conditioned. The standard food fair was available pizza, hamburgers, pastas, salads, deli meats, mexican food. It was good, but nothing great. Dinner: There were several rules regarding dinner that you must know before going to the resort. First, when you arrive, you are given a choice in times to eat, either 6:30-8:30 pm or 9-11 pm. When you choose you are given a nightly reservation to Don Julians at that time. The rest of the restaurants are by reservation only. You must also dress according to the dress code. I personally had no problem with this, but some might. Men must wear long pants, and a collared shirt. Ladies wear nice dresses. There are a higher percentage of Europeans there, and most of them dress up beyond the basic requirement. Reservations are made in the morning for that day. Reservations start to be taken at 7 am, and fill up quickly leaving you to eat at Don Julian. Restaurants: Don Julian is the main buffet. The food changes every day, and the menu is posted outside. Each night is a different theme ranging from Mexican, Italian, Japanese, American. The food is always good. I never had a bad meal there. Sir Edwards is the nicest of the restaurants. It is a seven course meal that is very upscale. The food there was excellent. I hear th food there is the same every night, but menu has several options for each course, so you can each differently each visit. This is not a buffet, the food is ordered, and served to you. The attmosphere is upscale, yet cozy. It never felt stuffy. Reservation go very quick for this place, I got our the second day we were there by getting up at 6:45 and being first in line. La Bodega is the Mediterranean restaurant. We loved this place! The menu is the same every night, so we only went there once, but regretted it later. You start out with a serve yourself salad and soup bar, and then the rest of the meal is served to you. The servers bring a skillet of vegetables to each person, and then serve you various meats. Each meat is served on a sword, that is cut off onto your plate. I think there were six or seven different meats to choose from; veal, steak, roast beef, turkey, lamb, chicken, pork. I loved this place. El Patio is the steak restaurant. We ate there at the end of the week, there was a wedding party happening, and it ruined our experience. The party was loud, playing music and dancing. It was also our last night, so we were sad. The food was very good, no A-1 Steak Sauce, but not very memorable. The Rest of the Resort: The resort overall was very well maintained. The grounds were were always well groomed and trash-free. I had read reviews of stange odors, but never experienced it at the Riu. There was a resort up the street, when wee walked by, had a pungent smell. The pool was very clean, and the swim up bar was rarely over crowded. The Beach was also well groomed, and never too crowded. I think only once did my wife and I have a hard time finding seats together. The water was trash and seaweed free, and never crowded. There was a bar on the beach, which would make anything you want. There was a piano bar in the main lobby that was top of the line. The bartender there, Faustino, was very friendly. I tipped him on the first day, which you don't have to do to get good service, and he had my favorite drink ready the next time I came to the bar. Conclusion: Overall it was very relaxing. If you are looking for a party resort, this is not it. It is very quiet and laid-back. It's upscale without being stuffy. We visited the other Riu properties located nearby, and very happy to have chosen the Palace. The other Riu resorts were very nice, and the the staff treaded us very well, but the Palace was just top of the line. My wife and I are in our late 20's and we were young for the resort. We met a couple our age there, which made the experience more memorable. Most other guests were older, and European. We would consider returning maybe for our 5th or 10th anniversary.", "Date": "August 25, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Morgantown, WV", "Title": "\u201cTruly a Palace!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2489214", "Content": "My husband and I along with our 10-year old daughter stayed at this resort Aug 15-21. We booked thru Apple Vacations. Below is our review: TRANSFER TO RESORT: The van ride to the resort took about one hour due to stops at 4 other resorts. No big deal - it seemed to go fast. CHECK IN: Fast and friendly. We had drinks in our hand within a minute of walking in the door. ROOM: Our room was on the second floor near the front of the resort close to the buffet restaurant, Don Julian's. Our balcony faced the tennis courts and was very private. I don't think the ocean is visible from any of the rooms at this resort. The room was spotless and the A/C worked very well. The mini-fridge was stocked with water, soda, and beer. The liquor dispenser held a bottle each of tequilla, rum, vodka and brandy. We didn't drink the alcohol, but the water and soda we drank was restocked daily. Two complaints about the room - the lack of hot water (If you shower after 6:00 pm, it will be in cold water) and the hard beds (like sleeping on concrete). Our daughter loved the towel animals that the maid left each day. You will have TV, but it is in Spanish. BEACH: Beautiful and blue, with powdery white sand. There was a little bit of seaweed, but it didn't bother us. Always plenty of lounge chairs and bare-breasted sunbathers. You can stay in the sun or under the shade of the palm trees. Take the time to walk up the beach about a mile - there are some rocks on the shore and a small reef. It is very secluded and a great picture spot. There is also a place on the beach to paint pottery, which our daughter did twice. My only complaint about the beach was the constant smell of gasoline fumes and noice from the jet skis and boats. POOLS: Didn't spend much time here, but they were nice. FOOD/DRINKS: The food got better as the week went on. We mainly ate at Don Julian's, which is the buffet restaurant. There is a different theme every night and always something for everyone. We ate at Sir Edward's one night and it was excellent. We had no problems getting dinner reservations. You can get a snack at this resort 24/7. It may only be a hamburger and fries, but something is always available. My daughter ate more ice cream cones than I can count. We are not big drinkers, but if you are, you can definitely get your money's worth here. There is a bar at the beach, at the pool, and you can get drinks at any of the restaurants. The few drinks we did get were weak, but if you ask, they will add more liquor. SPA: I got a massage at the spa (you can also have one on the beach), which was excellent. My daughter had her hair braided on the beach and we were pleased with that as well. Ladies - make sure you check out Roberto at the spa - YUMMY! SHOPPING: There is a small shopping plaza down the street from this resort, but prices were lower in town on 5th Avenue. EXCURSIONS: We booked two excursions with the Apple rep at our resort. We went to Xel-Ha for a full day. It was fun, and our daughter had a great time feeding the iguanas lettuce from the restaurants. We also booked the Snorkeling Adventure tour, but our bus didn't show up, so we got our money back. We also went out on the banana boat, not realizing that they flip you over a couple of times. It was fun, but a little scarey. We also went to the Xa-Man aviary. It was nice, but make sure you take your mosquito repellent. ENTERTAINMENT: The shows each night were not Vegas quality, but funny and entertaining. SERVICE: Service from the staff at this resort was excellent. We were treated like royalty. OVERALL: Very, very nice and very, very clean - this place is truly a palace. We saw no bugs, and we did not get sick at all (and we did drink the water). We give this resort a 4 instead of a 5 only because the food was not excellent. If we ever return to Mexico, it will be to this resort. Feel free to contact us if you have any questions.", "Date": "August 23, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cExcellent (Again!)\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2480687", "Content": "My husband and I just returned from two fabulous weeks at the Riu Palace Mexico. Since we relied on bulletin boards such as this in preparing for our trip (albeit our second trip to the Palace), we thought we would provide a little bit of information for those who have booked or are considering booking at this resort. We first visited the Palace 2 years ago (August, 2002). We booked here a second time because we thought that any other resort would pale in comparison. We were not disappointed. ROOM We were assigned room 2146 (located on the 3rd floor, facing the courtyard). As those of you who have read Jobob's messages know, there are no real ocean view rooms. This room was the next best thing. Views of the hotel's beautifully manicured courtyard, fountains, etc. Fantastic room. Only downside - try climbing 2 flights of stairs in 37C heat. There is an elevator, but it is back in the lobby and is a long trek from the pool. Notiwthstanding, WHEN WE GO BACK (and we will), I would love to have the same room again. We did e-mail the hotel twice before our arrival and requested a courtyard room. On one occasion, they informed us that they would do what they could but there were no guarantees. We are not sure if our emails played any part in our room desingations, but it certainly did not hurt. We heard that the beds were hard. We had no problem in 2002 and did not find the beds too firm this time either (although we do sleep on an extra-firm mattress at home). FOOD Loved the buffet (Don Julian). I am a vegetarian/fish eater, so was not fond of the a la carte restaurants that appear geared to meat eaters. This was not, however, a let down. The buffet provides ample choice and even after 14 days, we were not bored of the selection. The soups are particularly excellent. Those of you who have been to luxury resorts should set your expectations at a reasonable level. This is not 5-star a la carte dining a la Four Seasons Resort, but it is also not costing you $200 for dinner every night. By all-inclusive standards, the food is 5-star. There are 2 seatings for dinner (6:45 and 9:00 pm). We went to the late seating. DRINKS The drinks are great. There is top shelf liquor on request and no additional fees. Favourite drink - Cafe Palace (ask for it in the Lobby Bar). It is not in the menu but is known by all the staff. There was live music in the lobby bar on 6 of 7 days (piano on 5 nights and trumpet on one night). Also, the bar tenders will make any drink you want. You may have to provide some instruction, but they always oblige with a smile and will keep trying until they get it right! SERVICE We have been to hotels like the Four Seasons and Fairmont -- admittedly a different experience, but the service at the Riu Palace is comparable. We were amazed when a waiter who had been at the hotel 2 years earlier remembered us from our first visit. Wow! POOL In August -- very warm. Like getting into a bath. There are 2 pools. The one with activities and swim up bar is quite busy. The other pool is much more laid back (and is a mirror image of the first pool). The pools were great. The pool bar -- Las Conchas -- has popcorn and nachos as well as a shaded area where people gather to play cards, bingo, etc. We sat there for about an hour everyday to get out of the heat and played backgammon. BEACH Piece de resistance. We took a walk along the stretch of Playacar where the hotel is located. There is no question that the Riu Palace has the nicest beach (this includes the Royal Hideaway which is the nicest and most expensive hotel on the strip). The Palace's beach is breathtaking. It is extremely lush and the palm trees provide ample shade. We would suggest bringing bottled watter from the room to the beach. While there is a beach bar, it is set far back and the heat makes the walk feel long and difficult. The water is warm and generally calm although it was a little rough for a couple of days due to Hurricane Charley out at sea. The Riu Hotels outsource watersports to Scuba Caribe. They offer scuba diving (there are some nice dive sites in the area), parasailing, jet-skiing, etc. at additional cost. Great view while parasailing. As you know by now, there are many Europeans at this resort, some of whom sun bathe topless. Be forewarned. ADDITIONAL NOTES - A la carte restaurants (in particular, Sir Edwards) require same day reservations. Sir Edwards typically fills up before 8 am. - No light in the shower. - People do dress up for dinner. You can feel comfortable dressing casually or in fancier attire. Remember no shorts for men at dinner (strictly enforced). - There are shows from 10:00pm until 11:00pm every night, followed by live music outdoors. - The Riu Palace IS a top notch, elegant, sophisticated, low key place to relax and enjoy. It is NOT a spring breaker, clubbing, fast paced resort. That said, anyone staying at the Palace has access to the three other RIU's in the area which provide some of the above (including two discos). SUMMARY Our past two weeks at the RIU PALACE were fantastic. We have stayed at the Barcelo Maya Beach Resort. While it too, is lovely, the Palace was, in our view, in a class above. We will return to the Mayan Riviera and we have every intention of returning to the Riu Palace.

Here is my opinion: The Riu Palace is the most beautiful hotel either of us had seen. From the moment you pull into the driveway, you are amazed at the beauty. You enter the lobby and your draw drops. At one point my wife told me to close my mouth because I could not believe it. Check-in was hassle free and the staff was overly friendly in explaining what we needed to do to get dinner that evening (we arrived late on a Monday). We went to our room and were very impressed. We had an outside room, but who cares. It's 100 degrees and we never sat on our balcony anyways. We sort of enjoyed the privacy. There was a genourously stocked fridge and liquor dispenser in our room that cam in handy all week. The grounds are immaculate. We took picture after picture because we could not get over the beauty of the place. There are constantly staff cleaning and they are super friendly. The food was decent, not great. There was plenty though so we didnt have a problem finding something we liked to eat. As far as making reservations, we were worried after reading other reviews that we would have trouble getting into the speciality restaurants unless we got up early. Well, we usually went to breakfast between 7-8 and never had a problem. We ate at Sir Edward's twice and the steakhouse once. Both very good My biggest complaint is finding something to eat late at night. We chose the early dinner every day, and after a night out of drinking and going to shows, we were dying for some food. Well, there is nothing to be had. They do set up hot dogs and hamburgers, but a late night buffet like you find on cruises would have been nice. We actually ordered Dominoe's one night because we were so hungry! The staff throughout are great. Bartenders are the best. I drank Mango Daquari's mostly, and my wife drank wine. If you're by the pool, order a dirty monkey from Faustino, or as we called them by week's end, dirty Faustino's. Very tasty. We went horseback riding one day and parasailing another. Other than that, we lounged by either the ocean or pool. The weather was perfect, 98 and sunny every single day. Overall, I would recommend the Palace to anyone looking for a laid back time at a fabulous resort.

I visited this website regularly before my trip and actually drove my husband nuts and so I felt obligated to leave my own review and to thank everyone else who left there\u2019s, it really helped make our trip better. I find it hard to believe that people would have had a bad time at the Palace. We did our research before going and knew all about the dress code, the range in age of the clientele and the fact that the place isn\u2019t hopping until the wee hours of the morning, that is what the other three RIU resorts are for. If you want to party, simply walk to either the Tequila or the Yucatan resort for dancing and additional entertainment. We visited the other three RIU resorts and they were all great. We also walked to the little plaza down the street for some shopping. It is best to do your shopping in Playa del Carmen. We took a taxi for 40 pesos and found the prices to be much better. They advised us not to shop on Tuesdays and Thursdays because that was cruise ship day and the merchants tended to raise their prices a bit because of the cruise ship tourists. You can exchange your money in Playa or at the Hotel but the money exchange places in Playa give you a bit more pesos for your money. Room/Resort: The resort is gorgeous, small enough to walk to everything and big enough that you don\u2019t feel cramped. The resort was almost to capacity when we were there and we never felt crowded. The check-in at the desk was painless and we just took whatever room they gave us. We got the second floor facing the RIU Yucatan. I was a bit disappointed with the view at first but I quickly got over it. We hardly spent any time in our rooms at all. Other than the view, all the rooms are pretty much the same. I am very picky and didn\u2019t find anything to complain about. Fresh towels each morning, all supplies replenished when needed, including the mini-bar and fridge. Bed turn down service at night was a nice touch. They also took away any dirty towels and left a light on for you so your room wouldn\u2019t be dark when you got back from the show\u2026nice. Two double beds pushed together is a bit out of the ordinary but we didn\u2019t mind. Most importantly for me, NO BUGS!!!! Food: The Don Julian buffet had lots to choose from, no one should go hungry. We had two choices for the dinner seating: 6:45pm \u2013 8:30pm or the second seating from 9:00pm \u2013 10:30pm. We chose the first one and they assigned us a table for the week. I ended up not liking the table they gave us because there was too much traffic coming by from the buffet so I simply asked if it wouldn\u2019t be too much trouble to get a different table and they accommodated us immediately. The specialty restaurants were great, I loved the Sir Edward but my husband was partial to La Bodega because they serve you 7 different types of meat during your meal. We had NO TROUBLE getting reservations at the restaurants. We went to breakfast at about 9am and they still had spaces at the restaurants for the first seating, so I wouldn\u2019t worry about that. Beach: What a sight! The beach was beautiful. The water was wonderful. The first few days were a bit rough because of the wind but the rest were great. No plants or other interesting vegetation floating in the water and the bottom was soft sand and when there aren\u2019t any waves, you could see right down to your feet in the water. We never had any trouble finding shade; there are enough palm trees and chairs for all! Thank you to whoever recommended that we bring insulated mugs\u2026what a saviour! The bartenders happily made all my drinks in the cups and they stayed cold for at least 2 hours. I think the key to having a good time, is going with an open mind and a good attitude. Things are not the same there was they are in North America and we have to be flexible and remember that we are there to relax and have a good time and the resort really does try their best to help you accomplish that.

We had a superior room, but did not like the initial room we were given since it was not overlooking the courtyard as we had hoped -- the resort changed our room with no questions asked. The air conditioning was wonderful and the bed, although a little hard, was no problem at all -- in fact, we slept incredibly well. The only \"negative\" I can mention would be the \"scraping noise\" that we heard in our 1st floor room when the rooms directly above us were being cleaned (noise from benches being moved across the tiled floor) -- this was so minor, however, but I will probably ask for a 3rd floor room when we return. Food/Drinks: We liked the mix of \"sit down\" restaurants and buffet restaurants. La Bodega was our favorite (serves 7 different kinds of meat at your table -- great for those on low carb diets) since you typically don't see this type of restaurant in the USA. The only negatives would be that the steak at \"The Steakhouse\" wasn't the best and the deserts were not that good either, but, all in all, we were definitely pleased. The fruit was incredible. For those making 9:00 reservations, however, please make sure to eat a late lunch since there really is no \"snacks\" and the 9:00 time is later than you think -- for the most part, however, we chose not to eat earlier b/c we wanted to enjoy the beach/pool as long as we could. The drinks were \"weak\", but since we don't drink too much alcohol, we enjoyed these -- they will make them stronger upon request. Staff Service: Excellent!!! The staff at the Palace was incredible -- always working, always pleasant, and always expeditious with requests. Resort: Beautiful and so well-maintained -- the staff was always working on the landscaping and the grounds in general -- very impressive! This place is cleaner than any place we have ever stayed here in the US (the staff is ALWAYS cleaning). You will appreciate the resort even more if you walk through other resorts near the Palace -- no comparison! Beach: Can not ask for a better beach or better water -- absolutely stunning -- would have been worth the trip just for the beach!! Tour: We went to Chichen Itza and definitely recommend it -- although the tour took the majority of the day, you will enjoy learning about and ultimately witnessing the history of the site.

This is the most beautiful hotel I've ever seen (i'm a former travel agent). I am very pleased to rate this hotel as an excellent place to relax & feel like you are the queen. My family, my husband, daughter (age 18), & son (age 12) all loved this resort. The food was wonderful.........we loved the buffet (so many choices) and the drinks (virgin) drinks were just as wonderful as the real deal. The employees at this hotel were remarkable. They were always cleaning, smiling, and assisting guests. If you need something, just ask. The beach at this property is so picturesque, palm trees lining the beach along with a good supply of lounge chairs and shade. Lot's of non-motorized toys to use and the softest sand I've ever walked on. Be sure to walk to your right (facing the ocean), explore to the end of the hotel zone.... you will find a deserted beach with beautiful places to take pictures and swim by yourself (this was so gorgeious). The water is the prettiest color of blue and great to swim in (very warm this time of year). I wish we were still there. We definitely will return to this property. Now, the only negative to mention ... I would recommend folks who prefer to turn in early (before midnight).... to request a room closer to the pool away from the entertainment. We were in room #0101 very close to the main building... very noisy at night. The beds were not very comfortable, we did ask for the pads and they did help but it was nice to sleep in our own beds when we returned home. All in all, I would highly recommend this property to anyone that prefers high class with a beautiful setting ..........you cannot find a better property than the Hotel Riu Palace in Playa del Carman. By the way I checked out the other Riu properties close to the Palace and the Palace is definitely the best! Hope you enjoy!!!

After our trip, we decided that Playa del Carmen topped Cancun hands down and that it would be next to impossible for someone to top the RIU Palace. Listed just a couple of thoughts from our trip below. TRANSPORTATION: We were on a Apple Vacation tour package so transfers to/from the airport were included. With that said, going forward we will get our own transportation. Having to wait for them to fill the shuttle up at the airport and then wait for the bus (we were told was 45 minutes late, we did not wait to find out) when you leave is a drag. We were told it was $62US for a cab from the airport to the hotel, but after a quick negotiation, we had them down to $35.00 US and on the return we paid $40US (non-negotiated) Fast, air conditioned and door to door service, no waiting for stops at other hotels. THE APPLE REPS WERE USELESS! CHECK IN : After reading previous review, was prepared for something horrible. However, it was pleasant and smooth. Arrived around 10:30 am and they had a room ready for us. Many thanks to Hugo. ROOM: Bring a Glade plug in to help with the smell of the room. It is just a result of the weather and being so humid, not much you can do about it. But the Glade plug in helped a bunch. Huge room and sitting area. Always had hot water in the shower. Drink all the bottle water in the fridge, that way they replace each day. DRINKS: The person that suggested the insulated mugs is a genius. Made all the difference in the world. Bartenders had no problem making the drinks in our own cups. Couple of times the drinks were a little soft, but when we asked for more booze they simply grabbed the bottle and turned it upside down until we said enough. Great service. POOL: Never had a problem getting chair near the pool and there was no need to go down and reserve a chair. If you want something to float on in the pool, bring it down yourself. BEACH BAR: The beach bar is not that far from the beach The problem is they serve the drinks in 8-10 oz. glasses. Again, the insulated mugs did the trick. SPA: Wife spent much time in the spa and raved about all the treatments ( massage, facials, body wraps) GYM: is not large, but has a Universal machine that will allow for a good workout. Small set of dumbells ( 10lb-30lb) and some free weights. Couple of bikes and treadmills, but they looked to be on their last leg. Most people in our party ran the loop in Playacar for cardio. BEACH: INCREDIBLE. Water was crystal clear, even at night. Suggest taking a midnight swim TIPPING: Service at the hotel is fantastic and I don't believe that tipping will get you better service than the next guest. Thebartenders/waiters/housekeeping work extremely hard and giving good service seemed to be priority number one. With that said, we tipped sometimes to show our appreciation for the effort and it was graciously accepted. (Never noticed a decline in service when we didn't tip) BARS: The Cubano Bar and The Lounge were great for drinks before/after dinner. MIX OF PEOPLE: Did not see it like other reviewers. There was a great mix of people. Plenty of kids running around. Lively atmosphere around all of the hotel facilities. FOOD: We ate at every restaurant. Never had problem getting reservation. Got reservations anywhere from 7:30 - 10 am. After eating at all of them, decided was not worth worrying about getting reservation. Eating at Don Julians was actually a good experience seeing the different people and cultures. Would suggest either eating at Don Julian's or heading into PDC for dinner. There are great restaurants in PDC. OTHER RIU HOTELS: Went to all of the hotels. The Tequila had alot more children and activities, but just seemed dirty. The Playacar and Yucatan were nice, but nothing compared to the Palace. COZUMEL :Unless you are a snorkler, scuba diver or looking for a different beach to get drunk on, there is no reason to go over to Cozumel. They are selling the same things as they do in PDC, just at higher prices. Can't say enough about how great of a trip we had to the Palace, already making plans for return trip next year.", "Date": "August 6, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kenosha, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Honeymoon Getaway!\u201d", "Author": "maxanddrew", "ReviewID": "UR2424577", "Content": "We recently got back from our 8 day honeymoon at the RIU Palace (June 28-July 5). My husband and I are both in our mid-late twenties and had never been to Mexico before. We read every single tripadvisor--- review of this hotel, and wanted to contribute our impressions and feedback. Cancun Airport: Not as bad as we anticipated it to be! Our plane was the only one landing at the time, so getting through customs/immigration was a breeze. The timeshare/taxi people in the actual airport were stuck behind a counter, so unless you approached them yourself, it was easy to avoid them. Once outside the doors of the airport there were lots of people eager to take your luggage for a few dollars, a polite but firm no gracias works just fine if you don't want them to help. Check-in: We were early (about 11:00), so with check-in at 3:00 we had some time to kill. After traveling all morning, taking a brief tour and grabbing lunch, we became extremely tired and really wanted our room for a nap (it was about 1:30). We checked with the desk and they were able to get us a room early, however it wasn't on the 3rd floor like we requested, so we decided to tough it out. But it was nice that they offered! Room: We liked the split level floor plan. It added sophistication and made the room feel more like a suite. Our room was on the 3rd floor and our balcony overlooked the tennis court area and the RIU next door. We had seriously considered getting a whirlpool suite or courtyard view, but at the end of our stay, we realized that with the weather being so hot and with our entire days being spent outside the room, we never really even went out on the patio. Plus there were always people in the courtyard, so we liked the quiet exterior room. The mini-fridge was always stocked with water, sodas (loved the orange soda!), and beer \u2013 we never had a problem with running out of an item. Beds: The beds were very firm. I was fine with it for the first couple of days, but then I quickly joined my husband\u2019s opinion in wanting a bit more softness after spending all day in the sun. We put the two extra blankets on one side of the bed for cushioning and that did help. I would have liked to have known that mattress pads were available at the desk (I just read that!). Also, the two full beds pushed together became tiresome. We would have paid extra for just a single king. Plus, it seemed like a lot of work for the housekeeping staff to move the beds apart and back together again for both making and turn down. There were a lot of pillows on the bed, so while there were flat, once stacked they felt okay. Staff: This is where the RIU Palace truly shines. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Nearly everyone greeted us with a friendly Hola and warm, genuine smile. Everyone on staff works very hard and very long days just to make our stay the best possible. We didn\u2019t have problems with the front desk staff, like others have expressed. There were a few wait staff at El Patio/La Traviata that weren\u2019t very efficient or friendly during our lunches, but their surliness was probably wasn\u2019t that bad \u2013 it just stuck out compared to everyone else\u2019s superior service. We took lots of $1 bills for tips. We gave the housekeeper a couple every day (such hard work), and we tipped our wait staff and bartenders nearly every meal -- they really appreciate it. Patrick at Don Julian\u2019s was great, and Angel was really friendly as he took our drink orders every night on the courtyard plaza after dinner. Food: The great thing about buffet is that it\u2019s hard to not to find something you like to eat. Breakfast and lunch was pretty had pretty much the same offerings from day to day, but wide variety. Dinner at Don Julian\u2019s had a different theme every night (Italian, International, etc.), but Mexican selections were always available, as well as the pasta bar, salad bar, cheese bar and pizza. We were particularly impressed with the soups \u2013 so very good! We ate at Sir Edwards once, and while good, we noticed that everything came from the same kitchen, so it was just like eating the buffet food except served! The cuisine did lean toward the European palette, but we enjoyed the change of pace. One thing that we found helpful was taking the soup bowls from LaTraviata and filling them with soft serve ice cream, instead of using the tiny, drippy cones they offer. It was a really refreshing treat in the middle of the day. Bars/Drinks: We drank our body weight in pina coladas! The staff always made sure your glass was full and they seemed downright disappointed if they couldn\u2019t get you anything else! The lobby/Cubano bar was a nice place to relax and cool off. Our after dinner cocktails on the plaza area were a part of the best time of our days. We brought large thermal mugs for the beach bar, but ended up not using them as we didn\u2019t drink much while laying out. Our one complaint lays with the swim-up bar: the bar was always busy and they only had one bartender, leaving the poor man swamped with orders. Also, people were very possessive of their seat making it difficult to place your order without getting pushed around. In fact, there always seemed to be a large group at the swim-up bar for hours at a time, very noisy, very obnoxious \u2013 and many of them were smoking in the middle of the pool! Eww. It was honestly the one unclassy area of the whole resort. We also noticed that unless you specifically asked for it, they didn\u2019t put alcohol in the daquiri/colada drinks at the pool bar and beach bar, just the mix and ice. Beach: We spent hours upon hours at the fabulous beach. There was never a problem in getting a lounge chair and we were completely comfortable leaving our beach bag and possessions while we got drinks, ate lunch, or went in the sea. The beach was always clean and quiet \u2013 so relaxing! I highly recommend a walk on the beach every night. Kids: There were a few families with young children there during our stay, which honestly was a bit disappointing. There isn't a lot of child-based activities to do! Most of the youngsters were primarily well behaved, but the children's show on the courtyard after dinner everynight was extremely annoying. After a nice dinner at Don Julians we would sit in the courtyard playing cards, having an after dinner drink, enjoying the cool evening, only to have the relaxing experience interrupted by a noisy, cheesy kid-participation show. Even the entertainment staff seemed tired of having to pander to these kids. Excursions: We had every intention of seeing the Mayan ruins and such, but we ended up being better beach bums that we thought! We did do a 1\u20442 day snorkeling trip through the Original Snorkeling Adventure. It was worthwhile -- but I wouldn't recommend doing a full day snorkeling trip. After our 4 hour snorkel we were satisfied, but really, really worn out. Plus we wanted to get back to the fabulous RIU Palace! We also made a taxi trip downtown and made a few select purchases. Some helpful advice for downtown is to have a firm idea of what you're shopping for, as many vendors will push you around if you come off as wishy-washy. They were re-doing the sidewalks/streets of Playa while we were there -- so while it was dusty, I'm sure future visitors will be impressed by the upgrade. Also, we had a great time painting pottery on the beach. It took some time, but it was a fun activity and we have cute keepsakes to help remind us of our fabulous vacation. Weather: It was hot, but between the A/C'd rooms and the shaded coconut trees on the beach, we felt comfortable nearly the whole time. It rained for exactly 3 minutes the afternoon before we left. A sprinkling of fat raindrops is all it was! Packing: I only brought one skirt, and I would have liked to have brought along at least one more, as I wore it nearly every night for dinner. Yes, men are required to wear pants at dinner, but my husband didn't have a problem with wearing them at that time of day, as the weather cools considerably. We brought two bottles of spray sunscreen and one bottle of regular SPF 45 and we're glad we did. We went through nearly all of it. A deck of cards, a few books, and our electronic Scrabble provided some fun both on the beach and on the plane. We had such a great time at the Palace, we're afraid that we've been too spoiled!

It was very useful information and made our vacation a success. We stayed at the Palace from July 26-31. AIRPORT: The Cancun Airport was CHAOS. Our flight arrived with two other flights. It is evident that the arrival area is not set up for any more than one flight. After you get your luggage, make your way toward Customs as quickly as you can. There is no rhyme or reason to the way you get there (no roped-off lanes, arrows, etc.). Grab your bags and go. We had about five independent lines trying to get to the two Customs inspectors. After you clear customs do not stop moving until you locate your transportation provider outside and keep repeating \"No Gracias\" to the timeshare sharks. ARRIVAL/CHECK-IN/ROOM CRITIQUE: It was about an hour ride to the Palace. You know immediately upon arrival at the Palace that you hit a homerun when you chose this resort. The place is magnificent. We were quickly attended to by the staff and as we entered the lobby the beauty of the Palace left us speechless. The front desk staff was great. We had a \"welcome\" drink in our hands in under two minutes. They took the time to explain the map of the property, seating times, activities, etc. and we were on our way. We arrived at our room a few minutes later (2100 block) and our bags were waiting for us. The room was outstanding. Spacious, COOL (AC worked fine), comfortable, mini-bar and refrigerator well stocked. The balcony was fabulous. It was surrounded by eight foot high walls on both sides (maximum privacy), overlooked the courtyard, and had dimensions of 15 X 25 ! The beds are very hard, but I like a hard mattress. Just request a mattress pad and you will be fine. Requests for items were acted on immediately. We requested a clothes iron and ironing board and it arrived at our door in about five minutes. THE BEACH: Simply the most beautiful stretch of sand and water I have ever seen. We had no trouble locating chairs or a nice place to relax (either in the sun or under the palm trees). There are quite a few women who go topless so be mindful of that if you are bringing children. THE BARS: We drank at Los Mariachis, Las Conchas, and Bar Cubano. At each of them the service was fast and the drinks were NOT watered down. Our favorite bar was Bar Cubano. Go to the second floor balcony overlooking the lobby, take a seat, and enjoy your drink. A very private spot. ENTERTAINMENT/ACTIVITIES: There is a different stage show every night that begins at 10:00 and lasts about 45 minutes. Try to get there by 9:30 for a good seat. The performers we saw were very good (singing, dancing, magician, etc.) After the show there is usually a band set up in the courtyard that plays until 11:30. By Midnight EVERYTHING is shut down. If you are a party animal stay somewhere else. STAFF: All I can say is there was not one request for a service or product that was not acted upon IMMEDIATELY. These people really work their butts off to keep the place SPOTLESS and try to keep you happy. TIPPING: I know it is an \"all-inclusive\" resort and you don't have to, but give these people a buck or two. It means alot to them and it won't break you. We did and we were rewarded ten-fold. OFF-PROPERTY ACTIVITIES: We went to Xcaret for a day and did the whole nature park thing including swimming with the dolphins. AWESOME! A very worthwhile trip. We went into Playa Del Carmen for a day and went on a shopping spree. The jewelry business here is really overwhelming and its easy to overdose on \"deals\" on silver. If you are looking for items other than jewelry, the prices get better the farther you go away from 5th (main tourist street). Just as in the airport, keep moving and repeating \"No Gracias\" or you will be mauled by timeshare sharks and other unsavory characters selling everything from \"Cuban\" cigars to donkeys. Don't worry about your safety here. I have never seen as many policemen in one place at one time in my life. Check out the officers wearing black from head to toe and carrying sub-machineguns. Believe me, no one would dare try anything here. TRANSPORTATION: Take a taxi wherever you go. Do not get stuck on some tour bus where it will take you forever to get to anywhere. From the Palace to Xcaret was $10 US (20 minute ride) and to Palya Del Carmen was $5 US (10 minute ride). Money well spent. FOOD: This is the ONLY thing I was not thrilled with at the Palace. Let me explain. We ate at Don Julian (buffet) for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The preparation of food is very good. The selection/quality of the food is good, NOT GREAT. It is standard \"buffet\" food and I must admit I was disappointed. The only exception to this was for dinner on \"Chef's Night\". They served better quality items that night such as Beef Wellington and Spicy Steamed Shrimp. If they would have selections such as these EVERY night it would be a much better dining experience. Every night before dinner, Manuel (bellman) welcomes everyone. He says the word \"welcome\" in 60+ languages! We ate lunch at El Patio and again, the food was good but not great. We ate dinner at La Triviata (their Italian restaurant that at night is turned into a \"steakhouse\"). The steak was tasty but tough. We ate dinner at Sir Edward's (their a la carte restaurant) and I think this was the best meal we had. It seemed like they served a better quality meal here much like \"Chef's Night\" at Don Julian. Let me make one thing clear, the service at each of these restaurants was excellent. It was the food that was mediocre. We had no problems getting reservations for any restaurant and there were no long lines like I have read about in other reviews. We did NOT experience any sickness or discomfort whatsoever from anything we ate or drank. One odd thing is if you are looking for Mexican food you will have to travel to town because they really don't have a selection at the Palace. I recommend \"El Almendro\" in Playa Del Carmen. If you are looking for a mexican restaurant with \"atmosphere\" go somewhere else. If you are looking for authentic, fabulous food go here. OTHER GUESTS: You will see people from all over the world. You will see people of every size and shape. You will see people of every age from infant to elderly (I am 38). We got along just fine with all of them.

La bodega was a nice place with very nice workers (louis and Hernandez), and sir edwards was the most formal and Santos was an excellent worker. At the cuban bar (off of the lobby) angel was a very nice waiter who always had a smile on his face and was a joy to be around.

First of all, let me say that the Riu exceeded my expectations for beauty, beach, location and overall AI resort. By way of general information, beware of the Cancun airport if you have not travelled there before. There are gentlemen who appear to be very official and will pull you aside when you arrive to give you a time share pitch. They are quite skilled, and will delay you for 30 minutes before you realized you're being marketed! By the way, there were no time share salespersons @ the Riu. Everything you have read about the beauty of the resort is true. More importantly, the Riu had the most spectacular beach of all of the Playacar resorts. For those of you who are not aware, Playacar is a specific resort area of Playa del Carmen, about 45 miles south of Cancun. It is very resort oriented and doesn't really cater to the spring break crowd. The beaches at some of the other AI resorts nearby (Gala, Royal Hideaway, Wyndham, Iberostar etc) were more crowded and not as deep or did not have the advantage of shady areas. From the Riu beach, it is a very easy beach walk into town (you end up at Senor Frog's). There is no reason to take a taxi or walk the hot streets when its a simple stroll down white sand. My husband is very wary of leaving the resort and going into town. However, he was perfectly comfortable in Playa del Carmen and had no problem leaving the resort and walking around. The area is very clean and safe. The downtown is full of tourists and non-intimidating. Everyone at the RIU went out of his or her way to improve our stay. The room was perfect and always cleaned and stocked. The bartenders were on top of our every drink order. We have also stayed at Sandals in Negril, and the RIU is not quite as social. I think this is because of the age variance and the fact that people come from all over Europe and North and South America, so there are some language barriers. However, if you're looking for social interaction, there are always plenty of people around the pool bar in the late afternoon looking for a game of pool volleyball or just conversation. With that said, there is also a side to the pool which is very quiet for those who prefer not to be bothered. If you like a disco with strobe lights and loud music, just walk across the street to the Tequila. It's a totally different atmosphere there with a fun disco, but no beach and lots of children and teens. Also, if you get a chance, take a day trip to Xel-Ha and swim with the dolphins! It's expensive, but worth every penny if you love snorkeling and swimming. (I would avoid the snorkel trip offered at the resort for $30.00, its just not that great.) Oh, and don't sit under the coconuts on the beach or you might be really sorry. As for the food, it's as good as AI food can be. Huge variety, some great things, and some okay things. If you can't find something you like, look inward. Bottom line, if your looking for a great beach, a quality resort without hassle, a safe and touristy downtown and some social interaction, then the RIU is for you. If you want to party everynight at a different nightclub, enjoy the dating scene, or eat at a gourmet restaurant every night, then pick a different destination.", "Date": "July 19, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Illinois", "Title": "\u201cFabulous resort\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2301919", "Content": "This resort far exceeded our expectations.

From the minute you arrive, you feel like pure royalty. Everyone is so happy and willing to help you. The service was absolutely amazing, as was the food, scenery, beach and atmosphere. We had champagne with every meal and never tired of it! We barely left the resort, but we did spend a day at Xel-ha. I highly recommend this park, and you need a day to do everything. We spent about six hours there and still managed to miss some things. Definitely a must-do.

We were amazed with the Palace. Photos simply do not do this place justice! There is such grandeur, such detail in every corner that it was depressing to even leave the resort for a few hours. We were so impressed with the service by the chamber maids (cleaned room twice a day, always dropped off extra towels, called for bar re-stocking, etc.) and from the entire waiting staff. The food was excellent at all restaurants. We enjoyed the main buffet, Don Julian's, by far the best. Breakfast had excellent omelettes, sausages, bacon, hash browns, fruits, fruit drinks, cheese platters, cereal. Lunch was excellent, with dinner-like items such as stir-fry, fish fillets, beef steaks, fajitas, cooked veggies, italian food, mexican food, carpaccio, prociutto and other cured deli meats, sanwiches, etc. Dinner was always exceptional. Every other night they would have a theme dinner. One night, the Gala dinner had everything from sauteed jumbo shrimps, to frog legs, to paella. Some nights had more traditonal things like turkey, roast beef, beef wellington, whole roast pig. Oriental night was also excellent because the stir frys contained some authentic Chinese ingredients that these resorts usually overlook. Great service again. Some decent wines, nice coffees. Good sweet table. The other restaurants, La Bodega and Sir Edwards, were super as well. La Bodega is a meat lovers heaven; a true Brazilian grilling outfit, that barbeques 7 different meats, such as filet mignon, bull, ostrich, and brings them out on skewers, ready to give you any amount you wish. Very tasty. Sir Edwards is an upscale place that had nicely prepared itams such as seafood pasta, grilled snapper, even Oriental-style duck breast. I thought the selection of drinks were superb. Chivas scotch, top notch tequilas, liqeurs such as Campari, Pernod and Frangelico. They have 2 local beers on tap, one a lager, the other, a dark beer, almost an ale. Very nice. We mostly drank cocktails. Try our favorites: Banana Mama and Dirty Monkey. Sooo good! In the room, there was a fridge full of bottled Coronas, pop, water; plus a liquor dispenser with Brandy, Vodka, Tequila and Rum. We are beach lovers and we thought this beach was fantasic. Warmish water, large flat white sand beach. Plenty of chairs with tables. Our only disappointment was that the water was slightly turned up (not dirty, the waves just brike a certain way). People that stayed there previously said it's the worst they had seen it. One day we had very little waves, and the water was just incredibly clear. Hopefully this is what people will enjoy the majority of time. What was cool was using bread from the buffets to feed schools of silver angel fish, 10 feet from shore. Amazing! They would just peck the bread right out of your hands, like a pet dog! Unfortunately, there were no offshore reefs to snorkel, you have to go on the expeditions they offer. We found all of these extra curricular activities quite expensive, as in most resorts. We managed to use the Jet Ski for $50USD for 45 minutes. Everyone should go to the Captain Hook Pirate Show in Cancun. For us it worked out to little over $100CANpp. but we thought it was great. You go onto 1 of 2 pirate ships that sail out and around Cancun, while the crew put on comedy shows, contests, etc. It included a steak and lobster dinner plus open bar. Before nights end, the 2 boats come together for a staged pirate-style battle. Afterwards, It becomes a floating dance club. Great for family and party-goers. Another excursion we did was Xel-Ha. This is only good for people who love to snorkel. We saw giant grouper, pompanos, barracudas. However, be warned that it is a poorly organized place, and the line-ups are ridiculous. Be sure to ask your rep which days are not typically crowded to avoid this. We were roped one day into listening to a Time Share presentation. Of course, we didn't buy into it, but we got a free trip to Cozumel out of it. We snorkelled for 3 hours on a glass-bottom boat, and were given a scooter to rent for the rest of the day. So we drove around the south side of the island. Very pretty. Very romantic. We made some good friends and enjoyed some nights at La Pinata disco across the street at RIU Tequila. This was the most happening of the 2 discos, with lots of good music and drinks (try the Tequila poppers). There are no other local discos, but Playa del Carmen town is only a $4 cab ride away, and they have a number of good night clubs to enjoy. Again, we enjoyed everything about the RIU Palace; they made us feel like royalty, especially being honeymooners. The staff was warm, curtious and seemed genuine. And we loved the feeling that when you were outside, you felt like you were in the Caribbean, and when you were inside you felt like you were in a different world, like some place in Europe. We loved the great lounge upstairs, with it's grand piano, huge dark wood columns, crystal chandeliers, and a rich cigar-aroma. We loved the giant piazza in the evening, where people would gather, around the gazebo and fountain, before or after dinner, to enjoy the evening, and entertainment. We loved to admire the superb fountains and landscaping. We loved the Los Mariachis Entertainment lounge, with its plush red velvet setting, and live shows at night. We cannot say enough, just that it was beautiful, a perfect honeymoon, and it is our new vacation spot!

The main restaurant with the big buffet is what we liked best. We tried the Brazilian place but were not really impressed, all though most people in the place thought it was good. The rooms were very nice and very clean. The beds were very uncomfortable. When you first arrive have them place mattress pads on your bed or you will not be sleeping by the end of the trip, Dial '0' since there are no hotel style buttons on the phone which connect you automatically. You have to go through the operator for everything. There is beer and soda in the fridge that was always stocked, and they stocked it with more of what you drank after you have been there a couple days. Booze dispensers on the wall - Rum, Brandy, Tequila and Vodka. The property is awesome. Very clean, the lobby is beautiful. Everyone we talked to from other hotels all wanted to come to the RIU Palace because they had heard how nice it was. It was not to full, but there were weddings everyday which was kind of inconvenient because they closed one of the restaurants at lunch for the wedding. The beach is beautiful. I have been all over the world and this was one of the nicest beaches I have been to. They have a bar close to the beach so drinks are never to far away (although bringing a big insulated cup only helps). They have a ton of beach chairs and there were always plenty of seats available, whether you wanted to sit closer to the water, or further back in the trees. There were a lot of topless women on the beach, at times maybe 50% of the women in the front row of chairs were topless. It was very casual and laid back. The pool was nice, small for a resort pool, but with a beach that nice who needs a pool. We did not see much tipping going on. We tipped only because we know all the people are paid very low wages. Make sure to tip Manuel at the front door so he will take good care of you. When you are in Playa definately go to their 5th Ave and walk around (Its 50 pesos ($5.00) to get into town). We would go to the Tequila Barrel at night to watch the Laker game and had a great time. Also do the Parasail thing and go to Xcaret for the day.

The day of our arrival was our son's 11th birthday we asked if they could do something special and they put balloons and streamers in the room and also called Don Julian (the buffet restaurant) and they sang to him plus gave him a cake. ROOMS -We found the room to be very clean, cool and the fridge constantly stocked. We did tip housecleaing everyday because of the nice job she did for us everyday plus turndown service in the evening. FOOD/DRINKS - we tried all the restaurants except Sir George and we thought Don Julian had the best food and best selection. The only meal we were disappointed with was breakfast so we actually just skipped that a few times. The drinks are all good my personal downfall is no light beer was offered. I was really craving a Michelob Ultra. BEACH - we never had a problem getting a chair or finding sun/shade. I would caution mothers/fathers that there is a lot of topless sunbathing so prepare your children. I would also recommend bringing a large bottle of water because the glasses you are served drinks in are very tiny. The beach water was beautiful and warm. My husband and son did every activity except parasailing because they felt it looked boring. POOL - we enjoyed the pool especially the swimup bar where everyone is having a great time including kids. It does close early but we were ok with that because of the other entertainment offered. ENTERTAINMENT - every night beginning at 8:30 they offer a \"mini-disco\" for the kids which is dancing and a game. All the kids loved this portion. In fact my son made friends from Chicago and Canada and the would play together throught the day and night. After the mini-disco is adult entertainment and we thought it was pretty good. One night was Grease, another night a live band, the third night tropical dancers and the last night Mariachi's. My son enjoyed 3 of the 4 adult entertainment. SIDE TRIPS - we did the jungle tour on an AtV and you can book this at the hotel. It is really worth the trip and the cab ride is about 5 minutes from the hotel. We also rented bikes from Riu Tequila to ride into town but you can also rent scooters. I think this covered everything. All in all we totally enjoyed our trip, the staff, the food and the room.

We are both in our early thirties and I did not feel like the crowd was older as other reports have stated. We were constantly meeting couples our age, younger and sometimes older. I have been to one other all inclusive resort, Sandals Negril in Jamaica. I thought the overall quality of the palace was better than Sandals. The grounds are beautiful and very well kept. The food was great, I always enjoyed the buffet and never got tired of the selection. The specialty restaurants are very good also if you wake up early to make a reservation. The bars are always staffed well and serve high quality booze on request. I never felt any pressure to tip anyone at the resort although I handed out a few singles throughout my stay to those that put forward extra effort. Most everyone works very hard to make you feel comfortable, my cigarette was lit for me before I could get my lighter out of my pocket alot of times. Rooms are very nice and housekeeping does a great job. Our sheets were turned down each night while we were out to dinner and our fridge was always kept stocked with Corona, pepsi, 7-up and bottled water. The mini bar contained Bacardi, Jose, Smirnoff and a mexican brandy. The beach is wonderful, never had a problem getting a chair or a little table to go with it. Their is plenty of shade available from a sea of coconut trees between the beach and the pool area. My wife thought the beds were hard, we found out toward the end of our stay that you could request a foam pad for the beds. The disco at the Riu Tequilla was fun, good dance music and the bartenders were incredible. They functioned as a team better than any bar in the US I have ever been to, no one ever waited more that a minute for drinks. The Tequilla Bam shots they serve are fun too. I agree that the resort is not focused on entertaining children but I saw many kids enjoying themselves with the beach activities and pool. The entire Playacar area where the resort is located is beautiful, we walked into Playa del Carmen in about 25 minutes or cabs are everywhere for a $4 US ride to town. Shopping on 5th street in Playa was fun but watch out, some of the vendors start their prices rediculously high, like 4 or 5 times what they should be, so shop around.

The hotel is still beautiful and clean with gorgeous landscaping. The hotel caters to the type of person that wants a quiet, uneventful vacation in Mexico. Plan to end the day early due to the boring and lack of nightly activities and the necessity to rise by 6:45 a.m. to stand in line with the old men in their boxers to make dinner reservations for that night. If reservations are not made, your options are the dinner buffet (which is just okay) or grabbing an early burger on the patio (make sure the meat is cooked). The speciality restaurants and buffet are only offered by reservation at 6:00 p.m. or 9:00 p.m. so you either need to end the afternoon early to clean up or eat a late dinner. Men must wear pants to dinner however women can show up in a swimsuit top and cut offs. Take advantage of the great breakfeast buffet because the lunch buffet is not so great, especially if your stuck eating the same buffet for dinner. Besides a daily 30 minute game of bingo, there is no music or pool side activities. The beach and pool bar close at 5:00 p.m. without an option for nonalcoholic drinks and the areas basically become a ghost town soon after. There were always plenty of chairs and shaded areas available for those needing a break from the sun. The rooms are clean and cool and we enjoyed the separate seating area. The beds are rock hard and the walls are thin. The sounds of housekeeping moving furniture to clean the rooms start about 8:00 a.m. and continue throughout the day. Even though we were given four room numbers together when we checked in at noon, one couple's room ended up being on the other side of the hotel when we were allowed to actually move to our rooms after 3:00. Despite the complaint, the front desk would not budge to work out a solution nor would discuss the situation with us. We were also not given an option to request a fountain view room even though stating we were former guest that returned with six other people. The option for night-life is a 5 minute cab ride to town so in a way it was nice to stay at a quiet hotel without a bunch of drunks. It's a great hotel for the older couple or the couple with younger kids that are not expecting children activities. There were several topless women on the beach each day which could be somewhat uncomfortable for the kids and some adults (especially for those having a wedding ceremony near the beach). I made the mistake of purchasing souvenirs at the hotel and paid doubled the price for the same items that can be purchased across the street. We got passed the mix up with the rooms and two waiters that were extremely rude to us but overall, the staff was nice and displayed good customer service.

And one of the most relaxing and beautiful places to stay in Playa del Carmen is the Riu Palace. We spent four nights there in June 2004. Located within the Playacar Resort complex, the Riu Palace is a five-star beachfront resort. With 434 guest rooms, the hotel features five restaurants, five bars, three swimming pools, along with meticulously manicured grounds and a beautiful stretch of beach. All-inclusive rates run from $601 to $933 per person for four nights based on double occupancy. We had one of eight Jacuzzi suites (Room 2150) featuring a walk-in closet, balcony, and private second floor terrace with an ocean view. All rooms are air conditioned and have a ceiling fan, satellite TV, personal safe, minibar with liquor dispenser, along with a double vanity bathroom including a bidet. The minibar is re-stocked daily with Corona, Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, 7-Up, and bottled water while the in-room liquor dispenser features Jose Quervo tequila, Bacardi rum, Smirnoff vodka, and Presidente brandy. The food at the Riu is exceptional. Don Julian is the main restaurant serving international specialties buffet style with cooking stations for cooked to order requests. La Bodega and Sir Edward require reservations and provide service at the table. As with any five-star hotel, formal dining requires men to wear long pants at dinner, so don\u2019t forget to pack a pair of jeans or trousers. El Patio and La Traviata are beach front restaurants serving some of the same great specialties but with a relaxed dress code. We enjoyed fresh fruits, salads, and drinks with ice and had no digestive problems. While the food and beverage service is all-inclusive, the sunbathing is European plan - tops optional. There was no problem finding a beach chair and the beach includes several rows of palm trees providing shade for those who wish to stay out of the sun but still enjoy the beauty of the coast and the gentle ocean breeze. The Riu Palace is the kind of place you really don\u2019t want to leave to do anything else. However, if you start feeling guilty for relaxing too much and not being a tourist, there are plenty of things to see and do.

We had two girls checking all of us in and when my sister asked if we had our 3 rooms near each other, she said, \"didn't you hear her, she said we are completely full and have done our best\". We still didn't know, until we saw our rooms how close or far apart they were. Two were 3 rooms apart, and the 3rd was 10 rooms apart.

Just a few examples: She forgot to bring me flowers for my hair, bouquet was pink instead of red, had a table at the wedding set up instead of an arch, showed up late and in a tshirt at the wedding, and she was yelling at me in front of my guests right before the ceremony about not meeting her at a certain time. Well I was already very emotional and burst into tears. When I stopped crying, my wedding was over. Needless to say the pictures aren't very nice. She never said another word to me and I was at the hotel for 10 more days. She didn't say \"Hi\" to me before the wedding either so I guess that wasn't too surprising.

The staff were the most hard working and cheerful people we have ever encountered on any of our vacations, they go completely out of their way to make everything wonderful for your holiday, and the speed in which they serve and bring your drinks etc has to be seen to be believed, and ALWAYS with a great big smile on their faces. Rooms are always kept spotless and are a lovely size with plenty of hanging space, far more than usual. The mini bar is always kept full of beer, pepsi, pepsi light, lemonade, orange and water. A few negatives that I have read in the past I will go through. Beds being hard, well we never thought so in fact we found them very comfortable and other Brits that we met and spoke to were surprised when I told them that it mentioned them being hard by several people, perhaps we Brits have firmer mattresses than in the USA or Canada, i don't know but as I say we found them fine. Air conditioning not being very good, once again we found our air conditioning to work really fine and in fact during the night we usually switched it off as we got rather chilly with it on. Musty smell in rooms, maybe we were lucky but our room had no smell whatsoever, and usually in the caribbean you get at least a faint smell, but no ours was completely odourless and once again all who we spoke to said the same. Food being monotonous, this simply is the most unbelievable of all the negatives I have read, anybody that does not like the food here and the large amount of choice each evening, then all I can say is what do you eat at home? All in all this is the most fantastic hotel we have had the pleasure to stay in, everything from the staff, service , cleanliness, food, drinks, grounds and sunbathing areas are top class.

The only slight downside was that you did have to make dinner reservations early, but we did eat at 2 of the other places and found them not to be particularly out of class from the main restraunt which was consistantly brilliant. The selection and quality was overwhelming, I could eat there for a month and not get bored!! The hotel is very quiet but if you are looking for a more lively evening then head over the road to the Tequila where it is definately more social. (The clientel is very different there, and having looked around in the day as well, it makes you glad you booked the Palace!!!) There was one group of teenagers staying in the Palace that I thought would have been much better off at the Tequila, as theyn were definately on some sort of team tour with no adult intervention and found that they were allowed to drink a bit of a novelty to say the least.............!

To say the least, pictures do not do it justice. When our van from the airport droped us off the driver told us we were staying at the VIP resort. I have never come across more friendly, helpful and hardworking people working in a resort before. Everything was great. We are early risers (we can sleep at home why sleep away our vacation) so we had no problem getting reservations at any of the resturants. In fact we only ate at Don Julians once. The food was good and an eating experiance so try all the resturants. The rooms were beautiful and large. The beds were not uncomfortabe to us. The pillows are your standard hotel pieces of cloth. Just like you get in any hotel (this is the ONLY thing we could find wrong in a week). Water pressure in shower good. The beach is beautiful!!! Lots of lounge chairs so no problem getting one. If you need to get some together just move them around. All under the swaying palms. Bliss!!! No problem getting lounges by the pool either. The pool and beach bars did not serve the best drinks. If you wanted something fancy wait till you went to the \"real\" bars to get them. Stick to basic drinks (rum & coke,wiskey&coke etc.) on the beach and at the pool. Do try a Mojito (in the \"real\" bar YUMMY!!!) (only pepsi products) We enjoyed the theater every night. Walked over to Riu Tequilla one night but came back. It is quite humid at night watching the shows so be prepared to sweat, your in the tropics. We went diving 7 times during the week with Scuba Caribe (located on the beach). Excellent! We had pre booked our dives on the internet and gotten several free dives. We took our own equipment and they kept it at the dive shop for us so I can't comment on the rental gear. I hurt my knee on the last dive and the staff contacted the resort Doctor. He was there in less than 10 minutes. He suggested I have x-rays so the dive staff carried me up the beach to a wheelchair and the doctor transported us to the hospital. He also stayed and translated for us. We then got a cab back to the Palace ($6). The hospital doesn't accept insurance so make sure you have cash or major credit card to pay the bill. I had x-rays and saw an orthopedic doctor it ended up costing $440. I didn't end up spending hours at the hospital in and out no waiting. The resort let us keep a wheelchair for the rest of our stay (glad it was at the end of our week). We used Apple Vacations and talked to the representive at the resort. They arranged special seating on bus back to airport and wheelchairs at the airport in Cancun and Atlanta. I could go on and on about this great resort. We will be going back.

This will be long, but hopefully it will be helpful. My husband and I spent 10 wonderful days at the Riu Palace (May 24 \u2013 June 2) for our honeymoon. We had a wonderful time and did not want to leave. I recommend this resort highly. ---The Resort--- The resort was truly breathtaking. The architecture is stunning and has a very European, Mediterranean feel. The name Riu \u201cPalace\u201d is very descriptive. It truly feels like a Palace. The open-air courtyard is magnificent. And the stairwell off of the main lobby leading to the courtyard is probably one of the most beautiful areas I\u2019ve ever seen. Pictures do not do justice to the beauty of this resort. We are in our mid-twenties, and we did not feel the least bit out of place. There were tons of other honeymooners there. Probably about one third of the guests were Americans \u2013 there were a lot of British and German guests as well. One of my main worries was that we\u2019d feel too young, but that thought never entered into our heads. ---The Service--- We have never been asked so many times if everything was okay. And we always told them, yes, everything was wonderful! The staff was very friendly and seemed to enjoy working there. Their English was remarkably good \u2013 much better than my Spanish! The waiters were great, the bartenders were great, the housekeeper was great, the front desk staff was great, etc. We felt very pampered the whole time. ---The Beach--- The beach was outstanding. It was nice and big, and there are plenty of chairs \u2013 we never had a problem finding two chairs, no matter what time of day, and the resort was full. Plenty of shade and plenty of sun \u2013 your choice. The water was a stunning shade of turquoise. We went to Cancun last year, and the water there is clearer, but the water here is a prettier color, and the bottom was just as smooth. Worst I can say about the beach is that it was crowded. Not bump-into-your-neighbor crowded, but there wasn\u2019t a lot of space to yourself. Didn\u2019t infringe on our enjoyment, but the beach in Cancun was definitely emptier than the beach here. ---The Pool--- We didn\u2019t use the pool too much, with the amazing beach right next to it, but we did enjoy a drink and a swim most afternoons. We were happily surprised that the waiters will bring you drinks while you are in the pool (not just at the pool bar). The pool water was very warm \u2013 definitely warmer than the ocean. There are beautiful tile mosaics on the bottom of the pools that add a real touch of elegance to the pool area. ---The Food--- The food here was good. Not outstanding, but very good. We both got very sick in Cancun, and we didn\u2019t experience that here. We both felt a little off during the last two days, but we think it was from dehydration, and not from the food. We were able to eat and drink without giving any thought to safety, which we highly appreciated. We skipped breakfast most days, but the breakfast buffet was plentiful and good. We enjoyed eating lunch in the main dining room because of the air conditioning. We ate in the main dining room for dinner most nights, but we did try each of the specialty restaurants once. The buffet was our favorite because of the choices. The salad bar was really good, and the soups were excellent. There were always lots of options \u2013 pasta, veggies, seafood, carving stations, Mexican food, etc. Desserts were okay, but their ice cream was outstanding \u2013 probably the best ice cream I\u2019ve ever had. You scoop it yourself, and I had a bowl after every meal. La Bodega was okay \u2013 the meats were a bit tough, but it was a good meal. The Patio (steakhouse) was also okay \u2013 food was good but not great. Sir Edwards was a fun experience. It was much fancier and upscale than we are used to, and it was cool to experience that. The food there was very good \u2013 we enjoyed all the courses very much. It was a nice change to the buffet. Overall, the food on the cruises we\u2019ve been on was better, but this food was good and safe. ---Our Room--- We were in room 13 \u2013 quite an omen for your honeymoon\u2026 :) It was on the first floor with a view of the greenery and the Riu Yucatan. I thought I wanted a Courtyard view, but I enjoyed the privacy of our patio more, and the view was lovely. The room was very spacious and well decorated. There is a fully stocked bar and minibar in each room, which amazed my husband to no end. The beds are two full beds pushed together. Not the most romantic set-up, but it was nice and big. There has been a lot written about the beds being too hard. The beds were indeed very firm, but they caused us no discomfort, and we slept just fine. There was a good deal of noise in the mornings \u2013 we like to sleep in, and we were awakened most mornings when we heard the furniture of the surrounding rooms being moved across the floor. ---Excursions--- We did the Apple Vacations tour to Chichen Itza. We enjoyed it very much and were glad we did it. It\u2019s about a 2.5 hour bus ride, then a guided tour of the ruins. We stopped at a nice and safe restaurant for lunch, and the food was surprisingly good. We also got to jump off a 12 or so foot high cliff into a natural hidden well, which was really fun. Then we went back to the ruins for some free time when we got a chance to climb the main pyramid and explore on our own. It was about $70 a person. We also did the Apple Vacations tour to Xcaret. This one was not our favorite. If we were to go again, we would NOT take the tour \u2013 we\u2019d just take a taxi over and pay the admission fee on our own. It was $10 each way for a taxi, and $50 for the admission fee. We paid $70 a person for the tour. My husband enjoyed swimming in the underground river \u2013 I did not enjoy it but I did survive it\u2026 And it was cool to see the giant sea turtles. But, overall, we would have enjoyed the day more if we\u2019d just stayed at the resort. We did not take the Apple Vacations snorkeling tour, but we heard it was not very good, and that the snorkeling tour offered through Scuba Caribe at the resort was much better and much cheaper. ---The Bottom Line--- We loved this resort, and I\u2019d recommend it highly. However, this is not a good place to go with small children \u2013 there were no activities for kids, and the kids that were at the resort looked very bored. But for adults, this place is heaven. Stunning resort, beautiful beach, good and safe food, and wonderful service. All at a bargain price. We paid $2850 for 10 days including airfare and transfers.

All the wonderful things you have read about this resort is true so I will try to write things you may not know. This resort is located on a stretch of coastline called Playacar that is a gated community. You travel on a beautiful cobblestone road with sidewalks, and the resorts, condominiums, golf course and villas are on the sides. This is a definite advantage to staying here because you can comfortably walk to the other resorts as well as downtown Play del Carman. Other resorts we have stayed at there is nothing to do after dinner until the shows but here we walked to the Mexican Street Shopping and had drinks at the other Riu Resorts. As far as the other resorts, let me just say that when the van picked us up for our excursions the people from the other resorts went WOW. We had lunch at the Riu Tequila and I didn't like that they didn't require the men to wear shirts while eating like the Palace did. It was a very different atmosphere. Other things that may be helpful is bring a travel clock but leave your flotation mats at home because they are not allowed in the pool. This was really disappointing to us because they didn't have a area with lounge chairs in the water either and when it is that hot we would rather be in the pool than lying around it. The swim up bar was great and served top shelf liquor but it was located in a shallow area of the pool so all the kids played there. The buffet reminded me of a cruise with the ice sculptures and fruit carvings for decorations. The breakfast buffet even served champagne. Don't go to La Bodega but El Patio was great. Get the reservations when you can because they have a lot of weddings and there are nights it is closed. We stayed at the Moon Palace two years ago and there you didn't need reservations for dinner, the pool was fantastic, and every room had a ocean view. The Riu Palace has a beautiful beach with lots of shade, you don't need a golf cart to get around, and they don't cater to conventions and timeshares so everyone gets great service. Please don't let any negative things I have said stop you from staying at the Riu Palace.

As most reviews have mentioned, the service was very polite and courteous. The food was pretty good at the buffet, but after seven days of it we were in need of a little more variety. The rooms were large and very nice and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. But the nicest feature of the hotel is the beach. The tiny pictures that you find online do not nearly do it justice. The water is warm and clear, the beach is huge and never crowded, and there is the perfect amount of both sun and shade (from the countless palm trees). We walked to at least ten other resorts and the RIU Palace had by far the best beach. So why did I only give it four stars? For being a six-apple hotel (the highest according to Apple Vacations) and costing more than most other hotels, we expected a little more for our money. We had to ask five times in our seven days for our mini-bar to be restocked. One should not have to twist an arm to get a bottle of water at an all-inclusive, especially when they tell you not to use the faucet water. And as previous reviews have mentioned, the beds are beyond rock hard. Also, pray that the person in the room above you does not wear high-heels. The sound they make on the tile floors in the middle of the night is not conducive to sleeping. Also, watch your towel carefully on the beach. If you \"lose\" your towel they charge you $20, and someone stole ours one day. Finally, and maybe I'm just being picky, the pool is rather small for such a nice hotel. All in all it is a wonderful hotel with stunning architecture, immaculate grounds, friendly staff, and an awesome beach. I would say it is probably in the top 10% of hotels in Mexico, but for its reputation I expected a little more.

Overall, a fantastic trip and there were many people our age despite many reviews saying the average age here was 55. I will start with the only downsides. I know that everyone has already said how hard the beds were, but they were so hard it was a joke. Also, we were on the bottom floor (despite requesting a top floor room several times) and it was sooo noisy. I seriously was woken up about 12 times a night just from people walking in the hallways outside- I was often scared because it sounded like they were right there in the room! My husband also had his cologne go missing- not that it was too expensive or anything, but we were just surprised that it happened. Otherwise, the staff and service were great. The resort is immaculate and everyone is very helpful and friendly. We never made it to any of the speciality restaurants, but the main buffet was good and offered a lot of variety. The breakfast buffet got very old after the first few days, but I guess there is not much you can do about that. The pool is just okay but the beach definitely makes up for it!! Even though they stated that the resort was full we never had a problem finding a lounge chair at the pool or beach no matter what time of day it was. We went to XCARET which was well worth it. I would recommend going on your own instead of the bus that picks up all the other hotels on the way. We took a taxi which is $10 from the hotel and loved the fact that we could come and go when we wanted. One warning though- the only time I got sick the entire trip was after my lunch at the mexican restaurant in XCARET. We also took a day trip to Cozumel. If you do not care about the shopping on Cozumel I HIGHLY recommend going over there on a Sunday- this is when some of the shops are closed so there are NO cruise ships. It makes all the difference in the world. We went snorkeling in the national park and it was almost deserted. Perfect.

A word of advice if you choose to book a tour do not book through Scuba Caribe. They are on the beach and when we were picked up (late) they took us into town where we were shuttled into a store and made to wait at least 30 minutes for the next bus.

We were supposed to stay at Riu Tequila, but were upgraded to Riu Palace due to overbooking. Considering the difference in price, we definitely got a great deal! The place is beautiful, meticulously maintained, very impressive, staff is very helpful, sometimes too much. We had 2 kids ages 9 and 12 and there was a great selection of food for all of us. From our standpoint, the biggest drawback was - NOTHING to do for the kids. One stone ping-pong table, no basketball,a little bit of rifle shooting one hour every day, tennis court is not under any cover, right under the scorching sun, so not much playing either. We did not do water sports. The kids spent most of the time in the pool or on the beach, which may become tiring. This place has an older crowd, who relocate to the cigar/piano bar in the afternoon. The entertainment was predictable but pretty good quality for these places.. Also, it starts at 10 pm, so children did not always last that long. Other Rius seem to have kid's clubs, but this one does not - at least we did not see anything. Someone here mentioned that the room clock always reset to blinking 12:00. We complained and they put batteries into the clock to last it through the periodic blackouts. As far as the reservation for the restaurants - this is the most ridiculous thing, to make people line up at 6:30!!! We did not use it, partly because of the kids, partly because we did not want to strain ourselves, and the main restaurant was just fine. We have been to other all-inclusives - this is the first place I have seen this lame arrangement. Cheap toiletries, bring your own soap and shampoo (I take my own shampoo always, anyway). Beds are tougher than in the US but are just fine. Whoever cannot sleep, probably has a pile of feathers at home. We like more pillows, theirs were very flat, so we asked for more, got as many as we wanted ( I think, at least 3 per person) If you go to Xcaret, take the cab - it's $10 flat and it's a 5-7 min ride. You can actually spend another $20 to go for lunch back to the hotel and return. You'll pay more and get less for your money if you eat at the park. We stayed for the evening show, and left 10 min before it ended to avoid the crowds. Got the cab right away, and were in the hotel at 9:10. If you do the hair braids, go to the town. For the same pretty long hair they wanted $70 at the beach, $35 at the plaza across the street, $50 at the Tequila and we did it for $15 in Playa. Overall - great place, but probably I won't be back.

From our balcony, if we looked to the right and over the palms, we could see the unbelievably blue Gulf waters.

The pool was unexceptional, but the beach was wonderful. The palm trees provide enough shade from the strong sun so that you don't \"fry\", but you still manage to get tanned (there is a large beach without palms closer to the water).Our only real complaint about the RIU Palace concerns the front desk employees and Concierge. For a resort of this caliber, one would expect friendly, courteous, attentive service. Our check in was hurried and unwelcoming and at other times the employees at the desk were downright rude.

One example was when we asked if we could be seated elsewhere due to a smoker lighting up nearby. Although all the set tables were reserved, he set up another table across the restaurant to accomodate us. He said the only drawback was that we had to wait for the setup. (a mere 15 min.)

Also, something to bring with you is a small portable clock--(to help wake you to reserve your place for dinner)--our room didn't have a clock. We asked for one and got it, but it was rather useless.

Those that recommend bringing your own insulated cup is a great idea. Lastly, their gym. Prepare to sweat profusely before you even begin your work-out, the room is not air-conditioned and the windows do not open. Best to go to the Yukatan gym. As far as the bed goes, it's not the best, but it certainly is not the worst. Definitely livable, esp. with all the other wonderful things they have to to offer. We would definitely go back. A final comment, don't be stingy; reward their HARD work and leave a buck or 2 at the tables. It really goes a long way for them, and it certainly won't break you.

We just returned from a 14 night stay. There were no major negatives for us. We are a family 4 - children are 10 and 12. I read many, many reviews before our departure, some were very helpful, ie: bring your own soaps,shampoos and the like. Yes, the rooms have an odd odor but with such high humidity and the AC on all the time this is to be expected. We requested a quiet room and knew this would cost us a view. It was worth it, we were hardly in our room and when we were it was nice and peaceful. Yes, the beds are hard and the pillows flat so what we did was request blankets and extra pillows. Made our own 'feather beds' out of blankets and piled the pillows to our satisfaction. The 2 double beds pushed together was really a non issue, we joked about who was going to sleep in the 'crack'! There are 3 different times a day that the staff enter your room, 1 to clean, 1 to stock refreshments and 1 to turn your bed down and replentish towels (new towels twice a day). A young man cleaned our room everyday and we left $2.00 each morning. We tipped others as we saw fit. The security at the Palace is tight, there was no way to get in unless you were supossed to be there. All rooms have a safe. We rented a car and took our own day trips, I think we saved quite a bit. Tulum is a must, don't miss it! We spent $46.00US to get in and that included a private guide. We sailed to Cozumel and took a cab to a public beach and did some great snorkelling. The beach is fabulous! The pool was good too, great place to meet other people. My only regret was not bringing stronger hair spray, I had a lot of \"bad hair nights\", the humidity just flattened me right out!

We are definitely going to return. The Riu Palace is such a beautiful property! It looks and feels very upscale without being stuffy or cold. The service is perfect. It seemed like our every desire was anticipated by the hotel staff. With so many guests, they still remembered our names right away, and the waiters at the restaurants remembered what we prefer to drink. After the first couple of days, we didn't even have to ask for our drinks. They recognized us, and brought us what we always order. Every employee we dealt with seemed genuinely pleasant and eager to help. We had a chance to chat with some of them, and they told us that they love working for the Riu chain, and that, apparently, this chain is considered the best by the hotel workers. They get paid well (for Mexico), and they love their jobs. It definitely shows!This vacation was simply wonderful. The only complaint we had (a very minor one) was that the beds are a bit too hard (but it's the same at any hotel in that part of Mexico). Some people complained about having the two double beds pushed together. We didn't have a problem with that. You don't even notice it, once you are in bed.Food ranged from good to very good to great. There are many choices for all meals. Breakfast and dinner were my favorite meals (Mimosas for breakfast, omlettes and eggs made to order, etc., fresh juices, and a huge selection of stuff for dinner, from meats to seafood to vegetarian).Anyway, I highly recommend you try this resort.

The resort was impeccable, the service was second to none, and the grounds are beautiful. The pictures on the website do not do it justice. Everyday the crew are out there cleaning the floors, painting the railways, and making the landscaping perfect. I guarantee that you will be amazed with the beauty of the resort. The pool area is nice with plenty of lounge chairs and a great swim up bar. Just following the pool area is the entrance to the beach. This part is a tropical paradise with palm trees, hammocks, and crystal blue water. If you can afford to spend a little more, the suites are well worth the money. There are only eight on the premises and each includes a second floor private balcony with its own jacuzzi. It is incredible. The only dissapointment with this great suite was the fact that they had two double beds pushed together and made separately. That was a little odd. Another recommendation would be to stay away from the bus tours. They tell you that the stops are minimal, but after six stops to different hotels and two hours later for a thirty minute drive, we were not amuzed. I would recommend either staying at the resort or renting your own car or taxi. If you have an adventure side to you, the ATV Jungle tour is great. You ride out for about 30 minutes and then swim in an open cave and then ride back. It is well worth it. Also, if you want to make your wife happy and yourself, sign up for the couples moonlight massage on the beach at the resort. It is worth every penny. My only criticisms of the resort include 1. having to make daily reservations for the restaurants 2. no king size beds and 3. the lounge chairs around the pool get too hot. You can see that I had to get picky in order to criticise. I have traveled a lot and I would have to say this is one of the best resorts that I have ever been to. You will be treated great, eat wonderful food, be amazed by the beach, and have a great time.

My wife and I stayed at the Palace from April 10-17. We are 35-40 and had an absolutely wonderful time. The rooms: very roomy, basicly a suite with a stocked wet bar. In the wet bar we had Coronas, Pepsi, Water, Pepsi light (Diet), 7up and Orange soda. They restocked it everyday. Also, you had four alcohol dispensers on the wall-Vodka, Rum, Tequila and I think Gin. And all top shelf. The beds were firm, but not hard we slept very well every night. We do like a firm bed, but nothing like what some were saying that it was like sleeping on a rock, it was very comfortable. Also, the pillows were fine don't bring your own. Suggestion--Buy the Superior room to get the courtyard view, we did and arrived early and got one of the rooms in front, we were 15 steps from the pool. Gorgeous!! Pool: very nice, plenty of chairs, it was always fun by the pool bar. The water was very nice, not to cold very refreshing and great way to cool off. The pool bar was great, it was beautiful to just there and sip a drink and look at the resort. Beach: This is the third pool!! So blue, it was unbelievable. Plenty of chairs, never had to search for a spot. The water is so warm, when someone from the Pacific Northwest approaches the ocean it is usually with a wet suit and a certain amount of preparation that it is going to be very cold and I did indeed approach with the same mental preparation, but to my surprise it was warm, like bath water. Suggestion--Bring an insulated mug for the beach. The beach bar is not really that far away but who wants to get up when you are so comfortable in the sun. They will gladly fill it up. Food: All the food was very good. Don Julian was excellent, so much variety, never had a bad meal. La Bodega-one of the reservation places, steak house-excellent, you will love the way they serve it to you. I am a meat lover so I was in heaven. Didn't eat at the other reservation place, Sir Edwards- I heard it was also excellent. La Triviata and the El Patio down by the beach also very good, we ate lunch there. Like I said, We never had a bad meal, it was excellent. Say hi to Eduardo and Gustavo our waiters in the Don Julian, great guys, treat them well. Entertainment: A little boring, but since you stay at the palace you can go to any of the other three Rius in the area. Suggestion--walk across the street to the Riu Tequila, excellent shows and also where the La Pinata is located. This is the disco. Young, Old and Middle age in their, it was a lot fun. The music was from the 70's, 80's, 90's and today. A fun mix for everyone. Excursions: We went to Chichen Itza through the Cancun line which was organized through Olympus Tours. They took us to a Mayan village and in one their homes, very interesting. Not all tours do this. It was a very long day 12 hours, but very interesting and fun. Suggestion--Eat breakfast before you go. Went to Playa del Carmen-fun shopping down 5th ave. a lot of shops. Suggestion--Make sure you bring money because they don't all accept American Express, Visa or Mastercard. Also, we could only find two bank machines in the area. We went to Cozumel to go snorkeling, again bring cash, ferry only takes cash and Chankanuub only takes cash. Snorkeling was amazing, great pictures.

I felt there was food for every palate. The grounds were beautiful, and even though the hotel was to capacity, you would never know it because there was so much room! Especially by the pool area and the beach. You never felt cramped and you never had to wake up early to save a chair by the pool. There were hammocks under palm trees, there were beach chairs and there was a bar right at the beach! We looked for a hotel that would entertain our teenage kids and there was plenty there. Water sports and motorized water sports were right there on the beach. Bring money because they are independently owned. They are not through the hotel. The kids even parasailed and thought it was great! We took a few tours through Apple Tours and they were very accomodating. They were right there in the hotel lobby and took care of everything for you. All we did was show up at the specified times! The only problem that we saw was with their gym.

If what you expect from a vacation is good food, clean and spacious rooms, and a wonderful white sandy beach than this is the place. plusses: The staff was very frendly and cordial. They made you feel at home and also treated you like you were at a palace. We came in late on Saturday night so our choice room was not available but Monday we were upgraded to another room facing the courtroom. The in room bars were stocked daily although we were not in the room long enough to use the liquor portion. The beer and waters were consumed on a daily basis. The food at Don Julians buffet at breakfast and dinner was plentiful and delicious. The was also a large variety. I don't know how people can complain that the food variety gets old after a few days. If you want to eat healthy you can but there is also plenty to indulge on the guilty side. Sir Edwards was the best dining experience for us as they pampered us with a 3 course meal. (Try the Duck). The patio restaurant had a nice atmosphere but the food was average. we didn't make to La Bodega. The beach was spectacular. The sand does not get hot like back home and it is kept inpecably clean. They rake every morning and align all the chairs every day. We never had to reserve a beach chair and there are plenty of shady areas if you want to get out of the sun. The red flags were flying most of the week so we didn't get to use a lot of the water crafts but the body surfing was great. it was fun watching the midwestern americans trying to do it. There was a good mix of people from all over the world. I was surprised to see as many older teens as we did but they did not detract from the vacation at all. At night they would go across the street to the Tequilla Disco and not be hanging at the palace courtyard. The only negative was getting up at 6:30am to reserve the dinner seatings. If your there by 6:45 you will have a hard time getting a seat. Hints: bring insulated coolers to keep your drinks cold at the beach and pool. Tip your chambermaids with coloring books with crayons and I guarantee you will see the towel animals. Don't try to see Xel-ha and the Tullum ruins in one day. Take a whole day for Xel-ha. Taxis are 4 us dollars to downtown playa del carmen. You may want to use them for excursions also as the packages you get from your reps stop at numerous hotels so a 1/2 hour ride to and from becomes 3 hours instead.

The facilities were spotless and the service was generally excellent. I would say the food was very good. Even my kids, ages 3-7(Picky!) found something to like. In addition the staff was helpful with some special requests. My suggestion regarding kids is that you should pick another place if you are thinking of ages 4 or younger. At the peak of the spring break season there were maybe a half a dozen in the entire resort in this age category. I actively sought out the hotel manager to try to get a late check out for one of my rooms so that my youngest could have a nap prior to our late travel home. They refused to address the request until the night before departure and when I finally found the manager after being misled by the manager in training for 3 days...they could not have cared less. I also don't believe it is woth the premium for the younger kids. Regarding \"5 star\" this hotel will not satisfy the 5 star consumer. The bathroom soap, shampoo etc are more in the motel 6 quality. The alcahol options are not top shelf. The choices are mid range and the wine options are sub-par. The towels for the beach and pool were filthy. The Gym had no air conditioning.

It seems that the people who have gone to the Riu fall into two groups: those who went there hoping for a terrific vacation and those who expected to stay at a resort and be pampered. I think those who have stayed at AI's rate this higher than those who have limited AI experience. The Riu is much better than most AI's but is certainly not a 5 star resort whose clientele expect individualized service. The Riu's clientele is international and, as a result, has to cater to a variety of tastes. I think it satisfies all but doesn't distinguish itself to any one specific group. My review: we stayed there 13 days and you do expect to see repetition on the buffet after a while. However, I like to try enough different entres so I didn't get bored at all. Having duck twice was a treat. I didn't think Sir Edward was that much better than Don Julian's although it was nice to be served for a change. The Steakhouse again was nice to be served, but other than the steak, the salad bar and dessert table was the same as all other meal. I think they could have added some specialty items there to make you think you were at a whole different venue. One criticism we did have is that even though you had to get to the desk early to make reservations, there were so many weddings going on that the Steakhouse and Bordega were often closed for functions. This happened four days in a row with us and they would not tell you that until the morning you came for reservations. I assume they knew in advance but would not tell you even if you asked about the availability the next day. I found the front desk lacking in being forthcoming with any information and not helpful at all. Although they do try to assign you inside, we had no problem getting our table changed the first night and enjoyed sitting outside. I don't know if people were eating in Playa or on tours, but many nights the tables were only half full. Beach: not much to say about a white beach that is great to swim in, miles to walk along and terrific sand bottom. The Riu has the most natural shade of any of the resorts so you could choose to either bake or move back after a while to cool off. No beach service was a minor inconvenience but I find the service takes so long anyways it is easier to take care of it myself. The best hint I got on the forum was to bring an insulated mug. Those drinks they give you are half gone by the time you get back to your lounger. Mugs hold more and keep the drink cold longer. Rooms: we didnt mind the beds. We both slept great on the hard mattress. I do agree with no amenities in the bathroom except for some body/shampoo combo in the shower that is so K-Mart (sorry martha stewart). We ended up buying our own. Wish we had known in advance. The soap they have is the mini piece that disappears after one use. This is the first AI we have been to with no bath items and found it strange. We tipped daily and got little animals some days and some not. A sexist comment: most of the cleaning staff where we were , were guys. Maybe they are not into the animal thing. The room had a slight musty smell when we arrived but we had read about this and brought a room deoderizer to plug in. I dont know if it worked or the room cleared itself but it was a non- issue . For a couple dollars it was worth it. We did notice when we got home that some items that had hung in the closet and not worn, did smell musty, so i think the deoderizer might be a good idea. considering how much you pay for the vacation, a minor price . We had a room facing the courtyard. I sent an email two weeks in advance requesting it and another a week in advance. They responded that they could not guarantee rooms, but I think the squeaky wheel philosophy works with hotels. It is worth trying. We had a 3rd floor end room so no one above or on one side. the room numbers are strange with the first floor beginning with 0 , 2nd floor 1000, and so forth. If i were to recommend a room, try 2044-2060. Doesn't hurt to ask. These are away from the noise and facing in. Grounds: similar to the beach. Who could complain about manicured areas, clean pools and fountains, walkways scoured every morning. The number of staff assigned to keeping the grounds immaculate is phenomenal. It reminded me of disney world where you never saw any pieces of paper on the ground. It is something you dont realize unless you look around. We had no major complaints and the only major recommendation we would make to the Riu is that for a resort charging what they do, they should have a concierge. The front desk staff made you feel like you were interrupting them unless you were checking in or out. They were not rude but neither were they inviting. First impressions linger and ours was not that good at the front desk. To those who have not been to an AI, this is one of the best. You definately won't be disappointed.

Overall, we enjoyed our stay, which was our 1st \"All-Inclusive\" experience. My overall interpretation of the RIU Palace is that it is nice, but they cut some obvious corners. Specifically, what resort that calls themselves a \"Luxury\" resort on the beach does not offer skin care products in their bathroom? That is an obvious corner being cut by the resort. In addition, they do not offer room service? This was extremely annoying. Also, the wristbands are a bit much, feels like you are at a youth sports camp. The lack of king size beds is perplexing. If you are traveling with your wife and want a single bed, they push two double beds together, each of which is made up seperately. What were they thinking? Are they too cheap to have one dimensional rooms (i.e. kings and doubles) or is there some cultural difference i am missing? Also, the beds are hard as a rock. The \"luxury\" resorts i have stayed at spare little expense on mattresses, but apparently mattresses were of little concern to RIU. Positives at the RIU Palace were service, the beach, and just the overall location. All in all, we enjoyed our stay because the weather was amazing, the water was spectacular, and the beach was great. We didn't like the food, the lack of comparable \"luxury\" amenities, etc., but the location makes up for everything. Also, the only other option that is rated as highly is the Royal Hideaway, which from the outside looked very similar, but not as nice of a beach. Therefore, based on the options in the area, i would recommend the RIU Palace. But, if you have stayed at actual luxury resorts, don't expect the same thing here. Luxury in my mind is about the little extras, which aside from excellent service, the RIU Palace does not offer. THe following headings touch on several items. FOOD - Overall, the food was OK. However, if you are a daring person in terms of cuisine, you may enjoy some of the options. The basics, such as meats, were OK at best. The \"Steakhouse\" steak was not good at all and the other meats were simply OK. The buffet gets very old, very quick. My biggest complaints about the food are as follows; 1) No room service (except breakfast), 2) Same general food options. Even if you eat at the a la carte restaurants, their menus don't change. 3) When you arrive, you need to select a dining time for the main buffet restaurant. Being bound by a certain dining time is very annoying. I basically ate a bagel for breakfast, chips and guacamole for lunch. BEACH - The beach is the best aspect of this resort. The beach specific to RIU Palace is very wide offering both open and shaded areas. The sand is wonderful, the water is a brilliant turquoise, and the surf was never too rough. In the water, the bottom is all sand, which makes swimming enjoyable. Snorkeling is not very good in front of the resort. Overall, the Beach was great, however there is no beach drink service. POOL - I did not spend much time at the pool, but i suppose it is OK. It is not designed for swimming laps and it is divided into two smaller areas. Overall, the pool is relatively small, but is sufficient as there are not many rooms at the resort. ROOMS - The rooms are very clean, good maid service, and average in terms of finish quality. THere is an adequate bathroom, two beds, and a small sitting area. The beds are very hard, but i was still able to sleep OK. But, i think they were just to cheap to spend the extra $ on quality mattresses. SERVICE - The service is very good. There are workers everywhere, all of which are willing to help you out. THe service was a real plus to the overall experience.", "Date": "March 11, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bedford, NH", "Title": "\u201cAnother thumbs up\u201d", "Author": "Philsteph", "ReviewID": "UR1719182", "Content": "We spent the first week of March at the Riu Palace and loved it! I've been to several all-inclusive resorts and this by far has been the best! The food was really very good, not mediocre dorm food that you find in most other all-inclusives. The resort was so much nicer than any other resort on the Playacar strip. I would have been disappointed if I had chosen anywhere else. I've noticed several comments about this hotel attracting an older crowd. I think that is an unfair opinion. What I think this hotel attracts are people who care about staying in a very nice place. There were people of all ages at the hotel, lots of couples 30's and 40's and quite a few families (I would have chosen somewhere else to bring my 2 small children though). There were older people but it in no way seemed like a retirement village. Just a classy place that attracts people who appreciate quality. There are a few things that bothered me about the trip, I would still rate the resort as excellent because I was able to get over some of this stuff but just to be forthright with information: 1. If you want a room that faces the fountain/courtyard area then don't book with Apple Vacations. I don't know about the other groups like Fun Jet but we were told at check-in that they will not place an Apple Vacation guest in the nice facing rooms unless no other room was available. If we wanted to pay an additional $60 per day they would upgrade us but as a rule they don't book the nice rooms to Apple. Had I known that I would have done some better price comparisons with other carriers. 2. We never got the towels shaped like animals in our rooms or the chocolate on our pillows. Nothing nice in our rooms at all as lots of other reviewers here describe. We tipped $5 the first day but didn't feel we had any better or cleaner room even with leaving a tip. Our friends had a room on the other side of the hotel and they never got any of the special things in their room either. Not a big deal but after the whole Apple Vacations deal above this didn't sit well with me. 3. At dinner, its difficult to sit at the outdoor terrace at the main buffet resteraunt. They will want to seat you inside so you must request outside seating but even if you request it you still feel like they are really doing you a favor to seat you on the terrace. This irked me a few nights when we were sat inside (even after asking to sit outside) and I noticed that some of the outside tables (like 8-10) sat empty for the entire seating. I hope these issues above don't discourage you from this hotel because this was a great vacation and I am sure it was the nicest hotel in this area. We tryed the ATV's excursion one day. This was really a lot of fun!! They take you to a ranch located on a deserted area of a nice beach and they let you drive these 4 wheeler vehicles on trails right on the beach! We left at 8am and were there and back to the hotel by 1pm in time for lunch and a nice afternoon on the beach. One of the things that I don't like about lots of these excursions is that they consume ALL day by the time you travel to all the other hotels to pick up other guests and travel time and Mexican time and all that. We loved the hotel so much that we didn't want to burn a whole day on some excursion so this ATV excursion was really nice because we were back to enjoy most of the day at the resort. The ATV adventure really was fun and definately something I would normally never do! My husband and my friends husband golfed one day. They loved the golf course - both are good golfers and found the course challenging and pretty. They said they saw several native creatures on the golf course and that made it really fun. On the negative side, golf cost $160 per person and that is with my husband bringing his own clubs! Very expensive and no other golf course anywhere nearby (besides a par 3). Even though the golf was really expensive, my husband loved it so much he would do it again. Definately worth the extra money. Enjoy your stay! We will be back next year!

We loved it! Hotel is grand, rooms large and comfortable, grounds incredibly well maintained, beach spectacular, food and service quite good. What was unusually special about our stay was our many trips to the town of Playa del Carmen, especially at night. Yes, it's crowded and touristy. But so alive with international fun seekers. Be sure to hit the Blue Parrot for $1.25 \"Happy Hour\" beers. Take your camera for great beach and fishing boat picts. Our favorite restaurant (among many) was \"Apasionado\". Second floor seating assures you a great vantage point for viewing the passing throngs of happy and tanned visitors. Guacamole with chips was best ever. Food terrific as was contemporary Spanish jazz CDs.A personal highlight of my Riu Palace stay was booking an adventure tour through \"Alltournatives\" to a Maya village. There we canoed on jungle fresh water lakes, jumped from a seventy foot cliff while pulley and harnessed to a steel cable and zipped some 100 meters over a lake, and finished up by rapelling down a well-like opening into a large, beautiful underground lake. After a well prepared native Maya buffet, we were driven to the Coba ruins where we hiked to the top of the tallest pyramid on the Yucatan peninsula. The trip is an all day affair, costs about eighty dollars and will be remembered the rest of your life. Try to get Adrian and Mario as guides; they're young, enthused, and eager to please.

Our travel agent recommended the Palace as soon as we called him and after doing extensive research we agreed it sounded like just what we wanted. I spent part of each day for months reading any review I could find and found Trip Advisor super helpful. I don't understand why people seem surprised to find things like the beds being hard, having to make reservations at 7 a.m., etc. Do the research ahead of time and be sure it is a good fit for you and you?ll have a great vacation!FLIGHT - We flew USA 3000 out of BWI and it was fairly uneventful - there was a bit of a problem with luggage when we were about to take off, but even with a 30 min. delay we arrived in Cancun at our arrival time. Getting thru the airport was no problem even with loads of people arriving. I had brought our marriage certificate because of some things I had read about maiden names but I never had to pull it out ? it seemed like they hardly even looked at our birth certificates! As soon as we walked outside we located our flowered shirt Apple rep and he got us onto our bus and on our way. It took about 45 min. or less even with two other resort stops to let people off.CHECK IN - Even with all the pictures I had seen of the Riu Palace lobby it was very impressive! The bellman wouldn't hear of us carrying any of our own luggage to our room on the top floor. As soon as we got into our room I hurried to open our balcony curtain and there was nothing to look at but a rooftop! I had emailed ahead and asked to please be in a room with a nice view this being a very special trip for us and had gotten a standard email back that they would do what they could based on availability. I was very upset and spent the first few minutes crying before my husband went back down to the lobby and came back with a key to the room across the hall. This one overlooked a small garden area and the tennis courts. Later I did find out that Apple doesn't get the fountain courtyard views, but after looking around there really aren't that many to begin with. Overall you really aren't in your room all that much and I was happy in the one we were moved to.RESORT - Walking around the property we were very, very, impressed with the attention to detail in architecture, decoration, landscaping, and service. It felt like we were staying at someone's grand hacienda and they were very happy we were there! Everyone goes out of their way to smile and say Hola and ask if you need anything. We had fun walking around the other RIU?s in the area though we never used any of their services. The only other one we would probably consider staying at was the Tequila, which was very airy and had a cool pool area. At night it was definitely more hopping than the Palace. Being in the gated community of Playacar was very pleasant. Every night we walked around the streets and felt very safe.BEDS - The hard beds were no problem for us - I actually think I slept better than at home! I had read about this plenty and maybe it was because I was prepared for it.FOOD - My husband owns a catering company so food quality is important to us. While Don Julian's buffet was not ultra gourmet food it certainly was above average. We weren't all that impressed with the close to the beach buffet restaurants so usually ate all our meals at Don Julian. The service was perfect at each meal - napkins placed in our laps and drinks refilled as soon as they got close to empty. Our plates were always cleared right away. We both liked the fact that we could reserve our dinner table for the whole week as we were assured of eating out on the terrace, which we loved. It also was a definite plus having the same waiterers/waitresses. It didn't take long to get used to having champagne poured for us each night!Knowing ahead of time about the early need for reservations at the specialty restaurants we decided ahead of time not to do so. No way was I getting up so early on vacation! It was a bit irritating and I think they could work that out a different way but again - something we knew when we booked to stay at the Palace.BEACH & POOL - It was also no surprise that it was a bit crowded on the beach - understandable since we were there during a very high demand time. We always found a spot no matter the time though most days we did have to drag chairs around to get two next to each other in a good spot. The walk to the beach was not long and we enjoyed having the big wide sandy area to walk thru and seeing the turquoise water thru the palm trees. We never got a chance to swing in the hammocks but it looked like a very peaceful place to rest. The beach bar is in this initial area before you get to the actual beach. I have no idea why people complain about this - it really isn't much of a distance at all! On two occasions waiters were bringing trays of drinks and serving them to you on the beach. We usually spent mornings there and then moved to the pool area in the afternoon. It was a bit trickier finding lounge chairs there but we always managed to find something. We've been to resorts with fancier pools but it was still a good size and beautifully landscaped.KIDS ? We love kids and have four of our own and have been foster parents but for our anniversary wanted something romantic and peaceful. We weren?t able to spend the extra money to stay at Royal Hideway or another adults only resort and I was a bit apprehensive about the kids issue. They were definitely there but overall well behaved and only occasionally did we hear them running down our hall way or babies crying.SIDE TRIPS ? We had preplanned a trip to Tulum and to snorkle in some cenotes with a woman named Anna, who does more personalized tours. She is on the Playa Del Carmen board. This was a very enjoyable day! The Tulum ruins with the white sand and beautiful water background was gorgeous and my husband loved diving off a cliff into the centote. I snorkled for the first time so was pretty excited about that. We really wanted to get to one of the water parks but it was hard to leave the resort! We definitely want to do that next time as well as see some of the larger ruins.MONEY/ SHOPPING ? There is a nice shopping area just a few resorts up from the Palace which we visited several times. We also walked into Playa Del Carmen which wasn?t too bad a walk ? about 30 minutes. After walking all over gift buying we did take a taxi back to the resort though. ($4.total) We never exchanged our money. It?s true that most of the time you will get change in pesos though. We did bargain on pricing and overall felt we got very good prices on all the items we brought back. I thought it was much more laid back than some of the other places we?ve been where the shop people harass you to buy their products.PEOPLE - We thought there was a good mix of people from other countries and age groups. We sat next to a couple one night who were on their honeymoon and also spoke with a couple celebrating a 40th anniversary. It was amazing to see how many languages the lobby and head waiters must have to know! We never had any problem with us only knowing English.PHONES/INTERNET - Our Verizon phone didn't work even with updating the roaming capabilities. We ended up using our Walmart AT&T phone card and though the Palace did charge $1. per connection to the AT&T 800 operator this was easiest for us. Each day we checked our email at the internet cafe located at the shopping center at the RIU Yucatan - about a one block walk. I'm not sure what the cost effectivness was but again for us this was the easiest place for us to go.On Tuesday night a letter was slipped under our door asking if we would like to transfer to the new RIU Palace Las Americas in downtown Cancun for Friday and Saturday nights. We had already been planning to spend one day in Cancun and as much as we loved where we were decided to take them up on it. This hotel was magnificent! We were on the 6th Floor and overlooked the pool and ocean ? just incredible! As we walked around though we didn?t have the same feeling of graciousness that we had felt at the other Palace and were wishing we were back there. We also thought the buffet here was not as good. For Valentine?s Day my husband did go down early and get us a reservation at their gourmet restaurant which was excellent and a nice change from buffet food. When we found out this hotel had only been open two weeks it was more understandable that as nice as it was it just didn?t have the same ambiance that the other Palace had. We did have privilages at the RIU Cancun next door which was very nice.We would go back to the RIU Palace in a second! My only negative comment would be the early reservation situation for the restaurants and that they need perhaps one more to choose from.Feel free to email me with any questions.", "Date": "February 22, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGood Stay at Riu\u201d", "Author": "Kristine72", "ReviewID": "UR1660283", "Content": "My husband and I just returned from a 4 night/5 day stay at the Riu.

I've been to at least 6 all-inclusive resorts and this is one of the nicest. The two of us (both female, late 30s) had a fabulous time. The guests were from around the world---not even half were from the U.S. The crowd was definitely classier than most all-inclusive resorts, due to the premium cost. There were some families with kids, but it was mostly a \"couples\" crowd. The grounds are absolutely beautiful, and the entire resort is immaculately clean. The hotel is organized in an angular \"U\" shape, with the lobby at the base and the rooms in two rows with a courtyard in the middle. The courtyard is filled with fountains, palm trees, wrought iron benches and lanterns. Definitely get a room with a courtyard view. None of the rooms have an ocean view. There are also some suites on the third floor that have spiral stairs up to a private roof deck jacuzzi. No idea how much these cost---they were not advertised anywhere I saw. All rooms have mahogany built-ins, including a hidden full bar and mini fridge. The bath has a great shower with excellent water pressure, and a private toilet/bidet area separate from the sink area. The Riu Palace is located in a grouping of three Riu hotels, the Palace being the most elegant. You can walk across the street to the Riu Tequila, or next door to the Riu Yucatan. Downtown is a five minute cab drive, but the town is seedy and people constantly harass you to buy stuff. Instead, walk a half block down the street to the small shopping area. There you will find a much nicer, higher-quality selection without the hassels. Nightlife at the Palace ends at 11:00---the bars stay open longer but there's no entertainment.

We relied heavily on TripAdvisor for our hotel choice so I wanted to post a review once we returned. Let me just say that if you want a relaxing beach vacation, RIU Palace is the place for you. Each day that we walked down to reserve our chairs on the beach, our breath was taken away by the beauty of the water and beach. It is truly paradise! We were blessed with five days of sun and I am sure that is a big reason why our stay was so perfect. We are beach lovers so we would reserve our chairs on the beach at 8:00 am, go to breakfast, and then lay out the rest of the day. The RIU definitely attracts an international clientele, so while we sat on the beach, we could hear the conversations in Spanish, French, Dutch and Italian. There were American and Canadians as well but most days we were surrounded by foreign speaking people. We loved that!!! Due to the international clientele, quite a few women went topless. Our beach probably had the most topless sunbathers while some of the family resorts further down the beach had none. A very good reason to return, as far a my husband is concerned! The service at the RIU is wonderful. All the servers spoke English and were almost instantly at our table taking our drink or food orders. Definitely the best service we have ever had compared to our previous stays in Mexico. We had read TripAdvisor reviews that recommended we should bring $1 bills to tip the staff. We chose not to do this and I don't think we were given any less service than others that might have tipped (though I never actually saw anyone tip). In hindsite, I wish I had brought some $1 bills to say thank you to all those that were so wonderful to us. I'll definitely do it next time! The only complaints about the RIU would be the food (we ate mostly buffet meals except for one night which we ate at the steakhouse) and the beds. The buffet at Don Julian was good (not great) food which we ate at for breakfast and dinner. For lunch we at at the buffet restaurant closest to the pool and beach (can't remember the name). Both restaurants offered many choices to diners and offered quantity but not a ton of quality. Just for the record, we did not get sick during our stay and made it a point to stay away from the salad bar and water that we didn't drink directly from a bottle. On a previous trip, we got very sick so we wanted to avoid that at all costs! The presentation of the food was beautiful and it was obvious that a lot of work was put into every meal. I asure you, we didn't go hungry and might have even put on some excess pounds during our short stay!!! My only other complaint is that the beds were hard. We had read that comment in some reviews prior to our trip and would agree with those opinions. One reviewer suggested putting blankets under the sheets to alleviate that hardness. We didn't do this but it might have helped a bit. Even though the beds were hard, the rest of the room was lovely. The in-room bar was the best that I have seen and it was always stocked generously with water, pop and beer. There was a hard liquor bar above the fridge that had full sized bottles (not the mini ones you usually see in the other hotels) including good quality rum, vodka and tequila. Our room was overlooking the tennis courts and a grassy area and we thought our view was lovely. No noise other than an occasional tennisball being hit. If we didn't want to listen to that, we just closed patio doors and didn't hear a thing.

The room was great and we couldn't believe other reviewers had complained about the \"long\" walk to the beach! Unfortunately, the 2nd day we were there we took a ferry to Cozumel to meet some friends that were docked there on a cruise, missed our 7 o'clock ferry so we decided to go to the Hard Rock to wait for the next one. WARNING: if you forget after you walk in there, that there are steps leading up to the door, when you leave you'll miss them and sprain you ankle (yes that was me)!!! We got back to the Riu and from then on out every one of the workers treated me even better than before!! We would go to Las Conchas (BINGO,BINGO, BINGO- if you go you'll know!) and we would show up, have beers brought to us, and an ice bag for my ankle! The water was gorgeous, the food was great, and the service exceptional. Even before my ankle sprain we decided we were going back. I strongly advise a thermos or big, insulated jug for the beach- they laughed like we were kidding! We weren't able to swim in the cenotes, because of my ankle, but plan to on our next trip. We met a great couple from Denver that we spent time with, and another couple from Chicago that were fun as well. When I saw kids there they were always well behaved and there wasn't tons of them (we don't have any so that could have been an issue!). Being in our 30's we liked how it was pretty quiet at night but would sit out on our patio and have another drink before bed. As I stated before, even before I hurt my ankle we had decided on going back- the place was amazing, they had crutches at the front desk that we were loaned but the grounds were so clean I almost slipped once so I decided to just limp around!!

The experience there made us feel very special. The staff really worked hard to please its guests. Naturally, everything is never perfect--there was no light in the shower, the soaps were tiny--the beds were not set up for couples--they were rock hard and it was two double beds pushed together so you slept far apart from your spouse-- and unless you were on the top floor, there were scraping and walking sounds along the floor above. There were no toiletries--lotion, mouthwash, shampoo. The pool was beautiful but freezing. The food was great and there was always something to eat. There were bars near the beach and conveniently in the hotel. There was plenty of liquor in the room. The drinks seemed very weak. They decided to repaint wrought iron outside our room so we move because of the grinding noise and mess, then they started it again in front of that room a few days later. The sit down restaurant was nothing special, and I didn't like the waitress stacking and scraping off the dirty plates of half eaten food into stacks for removal to the kitchen right in front of us in the dining area. They have this weird reservation -for -dinner requirement--it was confusing--some reservations were made at the restaurant itself at strictly 7:00 AM, and some were made at the front desk of the hotel but only on the day of the desired reservation--not the day before.

We were thrilled with the hotel because of the cleanliness, the service and the wonderful location. Staying at the Riu Palace allows you to visit 3 surrounding Rui hotels (Yucatan, Playacar and Tequila), each with it's own 'flavor', so it's a nice change of scene. On our first night we were put in a room with no view (unless you consider the roof a view) and you could hear the bar below. We spoke to our Apple Vacations representative the next day and they took care of having us moved closer to a room away from the bar with a much better view from our balcony. Other than that, the rooms are clean and roomy and our cleaning person (Eugenia) did an outstanding job. We did hear of some small theft from another couple but we kept our valuables locked in the safe with no incidence. The restuarants are all outstanding and we loved our wait staff. The drink menu was excellent, and service was fast, and they have soft-serve ice cream during the day that really helps cool you off! We used the Hobie Cats and though fun, they've rigged them so they are slower and you can't get up on one hull. The beach is beautiful, with plenty of lounge chairs, hammocks, palm trees, and magnificant water. The salon is great and my 80-minute massage was outstanding and reasonably priced. The sand at the beach is kept very clean from cigerette butt's and used drink cups. The pool is nice, but in Jan. the water was a little on the cold side. Overall, this hotel had excellent service, excellent food and drink, and a wonderful location. We will go back to the Rui Palace. Recommended side trips: Chichen Itza and 'cenote' (long bus ride but worth it); 'Snorkling Adventure'; Tulum and Xcaret, and Xel-Ha.

I used this site extensively to make my trip selection so I thought it only fair to post my thoughts and opinions. We traveled with Sunquest Holidays from Toronto.We LOVED the RIU Palace ! The best beach holiday we have ever had. It was definitely a beautiful hotel. The grounds were immaculate and everything inside gleamed. Staff were constantly cleaning the paths, gardens, and interior of the hotel. The staff in the restaurants were very friendly and helpful. The food was great! I am a picky eater and I had no problem finding plenty of food to eat. We ate breakfast and dinner at the buffet restaurant Don Julian. One night we were able to get a reservation for the a la carte Sir Edwards. We really enjoyed our meal at Sir Edwards but not any more than our dinners at Don Julian. In my opinion the meal options at Sir Edwards in most cases were items that could be found at the buffet that evening. If you are not in line before 7:00am to make a reservation for Sir Edwards...chances are you will not get a reservation for the first seating at 6:30pm (second seating is at 9:00pm). We counted the number of tables at Sir Edwards and there were 15. Not many spots considering the size of the hotel. El Patio/La Traviata by the beach had a large selection of food for lunch. Everything from pizza and burgers to salmon, pasta, salads, and soup.Rooms were cleaned twice daily. Once in the morning and a second time during dinner. We tipped the maids a dollar US each day by leaving the money under the pillow. We were told to do this by our Sunquest rep at the hotel as if you leave the money out, supervisors or maintenance staff often come into the room and they will take the money if they see it lying out. You do not have to tip the staff but we tipped our waiters, maids, and bartenders. We brought down a handful of US dollar bills and handed them out daily. We noticed that most staff at the hotel worked 13 hour shifts, 6 days a week. We asked what the ave. monthly salary was and were told approx. $120-140 US a month. These people work hard so we felt they deserved the tips.The hotel was very quiet. The majority of the guests were European (German primarily) and generally older. If you are looking for a party place......this is not it. However, you could go across the street to the RIU Tequila nightclub if you were looking for nightlife. After the nightly shows from 10:00pm - 11:00pm the courtyard/bar area cleared out and the hotel went dead.We also really liked the location of the RIU Palace. It is in a gated community called Playacar. Playacar is at the south end of the town of Playa del Carmen. Playacar is a beautifully maintained area of approximately 8 or 9 hotels, the Playacar golf course, and private villas. On our bus transfer from the airport we dropped people off at other hotels and I was not too impressed with their locations. The new Reef Club Coco Beach for example.....looked like it was built in a rough area of Playa del Carmen. Some really seedy looking homes were around it. We had no fear walking around Playacar at night and often went for evening walks along the pathways. Other hotels were off the highway just north or south of Playa del Carmen and in some cases a distance from town. You could walk into the 5th Ave. shopping area of Playa del Carmen in 20-25 minutes or it was a quick $4 cab ride. We walked down the beach one afternoon into town.In my opinion the RIU Palace had the best beach in the area. It was much wider than others and it was lined with palm trees. You could find a spot in the shade or the sun and beach chairs were always available. The hotel frowns on people reserving chairs with towels early in the morning....it is not necessary. We never had a problem finding a spot and the hotel was filled to capacity when we were there. We walked a couple doors down to the Royal Hideway to see if it was nicer than the Palace. My husband and I did not think it was any better than the RIU Palace and not worth the extra expense. Their beach area was completely open.......no trees for shade and narrower than the Palace.The only negative thing I have to say about the RIU Palace is that the beds are terrible. They are rock hard ! I did as some others suggested on this site and put blankets under me but it did not help. By mid-week my back was in agony. It hurt so bad I had to make an appointment with a massage therapist as soon as I got home. I am 30 something physically active woman so, it was unusual for my back to bother me so much. We definitely plan to return to the RIU Palace again but next time I will be bringing my self-inflating camping mattress !", "Date": "January 28, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cVery nice with a few complaints\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1617668", "Content": "Just returned from my honeymoon at the RIU Palace 1/18/04-1/25/04 and had to write a review. I used tripadvisor and all the glowing reviews to finally pick the RIU Palace and wanted to put my two cents in. First off, the resort is beautiful. It is always very clean and compaired to the other resorts we visited within Playacar, it is by far the nicest. BEACH/POOL: One of the things I loved (even though others don't agree) was the fact that the pool area was well separated from the beach area. All of the other resorts had a small beach area right beside the pools, but the RIU Palace's beach was huge. There were always tons of chairs and the walk from the pool to the beach was not that far. The beach was by far the best part of the resort. The pool was average and the water was freezing. Only a handful of people even got in the pool. The ocean was cold too, but once you were in it was okay. After the 3rd day however, the water went from crystal clear to murky. I think there may have been a storm out to sea though. One important thing I have to say - if you smoke (which I do), please don't throw your cigarettes in the sand. The beach was littered with them every night and it really looks awful. There are trashcans all over the place so use them. ROOMS: The rooms were nice, but the beds were horrible. The hardness was not as bad as the fact that the sheets, pillows, and comforter were cheap and uncomfortable. Also, they had plastic on the matresses which made you feel like you were sleeping in a crib. There wasn't enough lighting in the rooms either. The walls were paper thin so you could hear everything - people talking, kids screaming, construction work, etc., all by 7:00 AM every morning. Very disappointing! Also - we were on the second floor so everytime the people above us moved we could hear them - loudly. I'm sure the people below us could hear us too. FOOD: I'll be honest - this is where I was most disappointed. The food the first night was really good at Don Julian, after that it was down hill. They constantly served the same salads, mexican dishes, over-cooked fish, chicken, and beef. Breakfast was not that great - lunch meat, eggs, bacon, sausage, etc. and lunch was always the same - salad, cold cuts, over cooked meat. I understand that its hard to come up with new menus on a buffet, but the food just wasn't that good anyway. If it had been good I could have handled eating the same things for a week. Sir Edwards was disgusting. We almost left, but didn't want to offend the waiter. The fish I had was over done and tastless. La Bodega was okay, but meats in Mexico are not that good so after I had a few bites I really couldn't eat much more. Overall, I would only give this resort an average rating for food although if you are compairing it to only other all-inclusive resorts it was a little better than average. BARS/DRINKS: The drinks at this resort were great. If you are particular about the quality of alcohol you drink, you will be happy with this resort. Although they weren't serving top shelf, the vodka was smirinoff and absolut - not too bad. They had Bacardi rum, and Jack Daniels Whiskey. All of the speciality drinks were good, but be sure to specify what brand of liquor you want or else you will get the cheap stuff. My husband and I really enjoy wine and they offered some decent ones. The champagne/sparkling wine was not bad as well. WEATHER: Kind of a let down. Most people said that January was the best time of year to visit this area of Mexico - those people must not like to swim. The water was cold. If you could put your body through the shock of getting in, it did get better, but we hardly swam even though that is what we wanted to do most. It was only about 80-82 degrees during the day and by 4:00 pm it would get chilly. It was in the 60's at night so take a shaw or sweater if you are wearing summer dresses. SHOWS: Go over to the Tequila for their show. It was fun. They get the audience involved and really make you laugh. The Palace shows were all dancing and singing and really were boring althought the performers really did try. STAFF: Excellent - can't say much more except you should tip them if you think they are doing a good job. They are there all day long doing their best to make you have a good time. DRESS CODE: I have to mention the dress code. Men are to wear long pants. A lot of men took that to mean that jeans were acceptable. I thought it was kind of tacky. I also so many men in shorts and they were never turned away. My husband and I really like to dress up for dinner so I brought a lot of nice dresses and he brought nice slacks and dress shirts. We constantly got stared at and talked about most of the week. Most people, including the women were not dressed very nice so if you dress up you will get looked at. To end this long review I would say that the resort is above average in most areas, but a little boring. For our honeymoon we were looking for relaxation and got it, but if that is not what you are looking for you will be bored. I would go back, but probably for only a long weekend.

My husband and I (in our mid 30s) left our two small children at home and wanted a week of relaxation and quiet. We found it. We have stayed at other all inclusives before and this one is by far the best that we have experienced. ROOMS: The rooms are exactly as they appear in the pictures. Very spacious. The beds are a bit hard, but not unbearable. After reading that the pillows were too soft, we brought our own pillows from home and were glad we did. The water pressure in the showers is horrible! The mini bar was always fully stocked and everything was cold. FOOD: Overall, the food was very good. The buffet at Don Julians was always fresh and the food tasty. There is a huge variety of food at every meal. Yes, it did get a bit old after a full week, but what wouldn't? Every morning they had someone making fresh fruit \"smoothies.\" These were a wonderful way to start the day. They also had made to order eggs that were very good. We ate in the other three dining rooms and were never disappointed. El Patio was pretty good (we both had steak and thought it was tasty -- nothing special, but good). Sir Edwards is good, but they were small portions and the pace for dinner was quite slow. La Bodega was VERY good. We really enjoyed the variety of meats and the different presentation. These places do require reservations, but if you get there by 7 AM, it is not a problem. It does not take very long to make the reservation, so I would run down and make the reservation and then go back to bed. Not a big deal. We also enjoyed dressing for dinner. While pants are required -- that is about all that is required. A lot of people wore jeans (way too casual in my opinion) and others simply wore dockers. You are required to reserve a time for dinner when you arrive (6:30 or 8:45). It seemed odd at first, but we really did not mind it. (When you make your reservation for the other dining rooms, you can pick a different time) DRINKS: Always very good. We never had any problems receiving the premium liquor we requested. We read someone's review in which it was suggested to bring an insulated cup. We did and it was a wonderful tip. Many other guests commented that they wished they had done the same. There is a bar on the beach, but it is set back quite a ways -- so having the cup reduced the number of trips necessary. The bartenders were more than happy to fill our cups. THE BEACH: This is probably my only complaint. While the beach is very large, it is also very far from the pool area. You cannot see the water from the pool. Having said that, it really did not matter. There were plenty of chairs available both at the pool and on the beach. There are also hammocks on the beach. This was a wonderful way to end the day. SERVICE: The service was very good. We did have a couple of times where we thought it could have been better -- but they were isolated incidents. My tip is that if you have an issue with anything, go to the front desk. The people there speak english very well and are more than willing to help. THE AIRPORT: This is important! After you clear customs, you need to go OUTSIDE OF THE AIRPORT to find the tour operators that are to take you to the hotel. Do not go with any of the people inside the airport.

We have stayed at several Sandals properties as well as Couples Ocho Rios. We were seeking an alternative to these well-established resorts and chose Riu Palace. With all of the very positive reviews, we felt it important to share our own thoughts on various aspects of the resort. Overall, it was a very nice place and gave us the relaxation and peace we were seeking. But, there are some cautionary notes. Here are some thoughts: 1. Room (4/5)--We requested an upgrade to a fountain-view room. We got it! It was a very nice room and gave us a great view of the fountain and courtyard. The room was clean and well-serviced. Different than some of the Sandals properties, don't expect in-room movies or much English-speaking television. Bring good books and enjoy the in-room bar. We tipped the housekeeper but found it added little to the quality of service. 2. Resort (5/5)--Marvellously clean and well-managed. It is in excellent shape and is startling beautiful to look at. It is truly palacial. 3. Food (2/5)--We found this aspect the most disappointing. The main buffet, Don Julian, is great for one or two meals, but grows very routine and tiresome after a while. The food, we thought, is prepared for a European palate. Some of the breakfast foods, in particular, were rather odd (quesadillas? hot dogs and beans?). Eggs were preared as were pancakes, but they were nothing extraordinary. Lunches at Don Julian were, again, fairly ordinary. Dinners were better, though we would have preferred more variety and quality. If you are looking for good desserts, you have come to the wrong place. They are below average in quality and variety. We stuck to the ice cream for the most part. You will enjoy Sir Edwards, though the service is slow and the portions very small. La Bodega is interesting in that they serve various meats as different courses. Here, you help yourself to the salad bar. Then, you are served a plate of vegetables and different meats for each course (steak, chicken, veal, turkey). The meats are excellent, but you are given only one a small piece for each course. We would have preferred an entire meal that we could eat at our own pace. The odd-pace of the courses was frustrating. The Patio and La Traviata are also buffet-oriented. They offer little different than at Don Julian. You will eat here only b/c of their proximity to the beach and pool. 4. Beach (4.5/5)--gorgeous! We found it crowded at times, but it was gorgeous. Vendors are allowed on the beach, selling necklaces and bracelets. Caribe Sun vendors also try to sell you parasailing or snorkeling excursions. It gets very tiresome, particularly if you already know what excursions you intend on purchasing or plan on not going on any at all. 5. Pool (3/5)--nice but not exceptional. The pool bar is fun, but in the shade. If you go in the next two months, you will probably get too cold sitting at the pool bar. We agree with others who've recommended that they move it in the sun. 6. Bars (4/5)--Very nice! The Cubano bar is great and well-serviced. Excellent for pre-dinner drinks. Las Conchas is a good place as well. We enjoyed this place quite a bit. 7. Service (5/5)--Wow! From the restaurants to the bars, excellent, excellent! You will not be disappointed! The service at the Riu Palace is comparable to any top-of-the-line hotel, even in the U.S. Special thanks to Vidal who really made our trip enjoyable. Tip him if you see him. He'll treat you right all week (we gave him $20 for the week). 8. Other guests--lots of Europeans. Not a bad thing, just different from what we're used to. Lots of speedos. Get ready. 9. Transportation--We were pleasantly surprised at how quickly we got to and from the RP. 40 minutes tops and it was a smooth ride. Thanks to Apple! 10. Entertainment (3/5)--The shows at night seemed lively and fun, but we did not attend many. We enjoyed listening to the music from our balcony, though we can understand some who think it to be too loud. The daily entertainment is minimal. The entertainers are good, but struggle to get anyone to join the activities....little enthusiasm for volleyball or other activities. You'll enjoy this place, no doubt, but, for the money, we might choose differently next time.

I won't go into 3 paragraphs about it but will say some key words that will not only make me return to this specific resort, but I will feel confident in recommending it to anyone...even the most \"finicky\". For the property: clean, fantastic architecture, beautiful beach, fabulous pool, plentiful activities and outlets, staffed very well. For the guest rooms: very large, twice daily maid service, balconies, bathrooms (my favorite) were large and had granite countertops and bathing area, beds were large (and not as hard as most hotels in Mexico), television stations were great (for those sunburned days!), bar was stocked often (sodas, waters, and premium liquor). Food: variety, quality, convenient, pleasantly surprised. You gotta try the ice cream machines with the mini-cones...they were my favorite part of the meal! You have some restaurants that were stricktly buffet but then there were the ala carte restaurants that were a nice change...and everything I had in every restaurant was excellent. And the most important thing? Service. This makes the customer return. You could have the Taj Majal as the hotel and if the staff doesn't treat you as importantly as the Riu Palace did, you simply wouldn't return. They could have Wolfgang Puck making tableside dishes personally for you and if the service was rude, you wouldn't return. So in other words, this is the main reason I will return. Knowing your name, asking if you'd like a beverage before you have to ask, every staff member greeting you, responsiveness and a sense of urgency for your requests, never having to ask twice (and sometimes never having to ask once!).I will return.

We are 25 year old honeymooners. Food- wonderful, large variety at Don Julians, although we didn't enjoy Sir Edwards. Our room upon check in had the view of a large blue wall and the sounds of the kitchen, but we thought the rest of the place is so incredible how much time will we be spending in our room? So, after day three of the overwhelming smell of food and dishes breaking we requested a room change and were offered another room with a slightly better view of the hotel across the way. The beach was georgeous, by far the best looking and largest among the beaches on the strip. The grounds were amazing kept. The pool bar and lobby bar had great atmospheres. The nightly entertainment was awful, although we did miss the Michael Jackson show because my husband was ill that night and I heard that was an entertaining show. Overall, I was not impressed with the service- at all- and it is actally disappointing for me to have to say that because we were so excited to go after reading the rave reviews. The crowd when we were there were much older, I'd say average age of 55-60. My husband looks young and I felt that we were treated differently because of our age, I could not imagine what else it could have been, we always dressed nice for dinner, khaki's polos, I wore nice sun dresses every evening. We met a wonderful couple from Toronto who we joked with about the service, I don't think they believed that we weren't getting the service they did; until we got a table in the theatre one evening and only then did they realize what we had been experiencing the whole trip. They tried to order drinks and either the drink order was wrong or totally forgotten- note: by this time we found it amusing and weren't about to let it ruin our honeymoon. Our friends even tipped the head waiter $20 later in the week to give us a bottle of chanpagne and a fruit basket in our room, and we received the champagne, but no basket. We tipped our housekeeping $2/ twice a day and received one animal one day (naturally our friends came to breakfast every morning joking with us about their new creature) We also brought $100 in one dollar bills and tipped everyone all day a dollar or two.

I got there with my best friend and her family, all together there was eight of us. We were waiting for our room keys when they served us a wonderful drink. I was so excited to be there and was excited for the next 7 days. There was so much to do for my friend and I, both being 18. What more could you ask for, the rui tequila and rui yucatan both in the same vacinity as the rui palace have discos with a bar inside of them. There a shows at all of these hotels every nite which are actually pretty funny. My friend and I actually participated in \"Miss Rui Palace\" which I have to say was quite embaressing. The bar inside the rui palace is open till 7 a.m. Downtown Playa del Carmen is outrageous! It was so much fun going there and seeing all the different shops. There is also a small mall across the street from the rui playacar which is next to rui palace. My friend and I walked everywhere that week and we even went to an internet cafe in the mall and talked with our friends. We loved walking right onto the beach in the morning after the wonderful breakfast buffet. Let me tell you the morning I got on the plane I was soo upset to go home. I was virtually obsessed with the palace and all of the hotels around it. My friend and I rented a mini car and drove it around all of the hotels. As a family we went snorkeling, boating, 4 wheeling and ate meals together. The service was amazing. When I got home, I let my mom know how awesome it was and my best friend and I planned to go back again in July for our graduation present. I was more than excited. We stayed in the rui playacar this time which I have to admitt wasn't as nice as the rui palace. If you have a choice stay in the palace then please do so, becuase it is really heaven on earth inside there.

We have a family of four one 6-year-old boy and a 22-month-old girl. In our opinion, RIU Palace is a great hotel with above average food and excellent service. The hotel looked like it was about 60% to 70% of capacity. Readers should be aware that service is typically affected in the peak travel periods such as Christmas or Spring Break.The types of guests by our approximation were 50% older couples, 25% family and 25% elderly. Almost 40% to 50% of the guests were Europeans. Canadians were well represented.RIU palace is more formal than a lot of all-inclusive resorts. Men are required to wear pants to dinner. So, if you are into that, than you will feel right at home. Unfortunately, we were not used to this system, which is similar to a cruise ship with their dinner sittings.We have the standard room, which has a living room with a pullout sofa bed. Like a lot of resort in the Mayan Riviera, the rooms do not have good ocean views. Even the rooms facing the beach do not have a good view of the beach because the beach is so far away and the hundred of coconut trees giving shade to the beach goers stand in the way.While the view of the room was not the centerpiece of the hotel experience like RIU Cancun, the furnishing and excellent condition of the room and property gave us a lot of living comfort such as very clean floor to walk on. The maid service was great as they clean our room around 10 AM. With two young kids, we needed a clean room when we got back from the beach after lunch. So, we really appreciate the early maid service. They also do turn down, which is a nice touch as they also replenish the bathroom towels.The hardness of the bed has been well documented by past contributions. Indeed, the bed was hard. While we can deal with that, we were not prepared by the extremely soft pillows. We were sleeping on two pillows for support and we are still supporting a stiff neck a week later. On the bright side, it took no more than 15 minutes for the extra pillows to be delivered that is a good time.RIU Palace s breakfast is fairly standard. The benchmark here is Barcel\u00f3 Maya, where you can have any omelette you want with a wider variety of cereal, fresh fruits and baked pastries. In general, all the all-inclusive tend to offer the same items. There really is not that much room for innovation and improvement and they (Beaches, Barcel\u00f3, and Melia to name a few in the same class) are all fairly comparable in selection and quality. One thing is for sure, it is great to roll out of bed to a broad selection of break fast food.Lunch is offered in at least a couple of restaurant at RIU Palace. We liked the beach grill El Patio for its great hamburgers and hot dogs for lunch. Beside it is an Italian restaurant with pasta for the adults. The ambiance here was much nicer as these restaurants are right next to the beach than Don Julian, the more formal main restaurant. The quality at RIU Palace is slightly above the other resort. There is a large enough selection that everyone should be able to find something acceptable.On dinner, we had to get use to a new system of sitting. It was very similar to a cruise ship. You had to pick a sitting and a table is reserved for you. This is true for all the restaurants. Until now, all the resort we have been to, and we have been to many, have the main restaurant available at any time during dinner. This gave us the flexibility to do what we want. It just took a bit of getting use to. There were more restaurants at RIU Palace than we were able to try.Using Beaches Turks and Caicos as the benchmark of 10 for all-inclusives, where they have grilled chicken breast that would compete with the best restaurants, RIU Palace would rate a close second. Than again, food is a personal and subjective opinion.After getting use to the system, we faithfully reported for dinner. It worked really well. We were always guaranteed our table, which is close to the food a strategic position for parents with young kids. The food was freshly cooked and varied day to day. If you like seafood, large shrimps with mussels dishes were served almost every night. There is a special Mexican section where you can put together great fajitas. The orange juice was always fresh squeezed. The ice creams were great. And finally for the men, bring a couple of pairs of pants for dinner.Moving on to the beach, RIU Palace shares a stretch of beach with 3 other RIU resorts. RIU Tequila is the only resort without its own beachfront. Guests at RIU Tequila are provided a trolley service between the hotel and the beach. And, yes, the beach is packed. The rows and rows of blue and green beach chairs cover the entire stretch of beach. Interestingly, from talking to a few hotel guests who were there a few years ago, the beach use to be a lot wider as it went out a lot further. Now, the guests are all packed closely together. Put your suntan oil on, walkman to your ears, lye back close your eyes and they all disappear. That s the trick. Things are really not as bad as it sounds.We hung around the hammocks as they were shaded areas. Our 2 year old daughter entertained herself with the water tap and some tea pots and cups for hours on end. Our son joined the mini-kids club a couple of times but chose to spent time with us instead. We did only try the RIU Yucatan kids program. The RIU Yucatan kids club was well shaded unlike the more popular RIU Tequila kids club. In any case, it is quite a walk from RIU Palace. We found Beaches and Barcel\u00f3 to have better day kids programs and location of the kids club. Of course, these resorts specifically target young families.The pool is clean because not many people swim in it. It is very cool to the point it is almost cold. Even the divers with their wet suits commend on the water temperature. In general, warmer pools have a lot of swimmers and the pools get cloudy by mid day, which makes it also very uninviting. The RIU pool is not large by comparison to other resorts. A note worthy point is that the temperature in December when we were there was not hot and on some days in was actually cool with the wind. The ocean, however, was perfect. On the cooler days, the ocean was warmer than the air with the wind chill factor.The hotel provides a number of recreational water crafts such as paddle boats, kayaks, and sail boats. Before you go get one, you have to go to the dive shop to sign a waiver. Take a dive or a resort dive if you have the time. The dive shop staff is excellent. The boogie boards are especially fun when the waves are in.If you like to shop, it s only a 5 minute walk to a little mall outside the hotel. The prices at the mall are outrageous compared to Playa Del Carmen, a small sea side town 3 kilometres away, or a half hour leisurely walk. The taxi ride is 40 pesos or US$4. There is a lot Mayan craft work available and bargaining is recommended.The Mayan Riviera is located centrally to a broad range of interesting day trips. Our favourite is Xel Ha, the world largest natural aquarium where visitors can swim in. Visitors can take large rubber tubes and float down the river. Natural hot spring vents flow through the river warming the snorkellers. There are cliffs to jump off and rope bridges to cross rivers. If you do go, get there when it opens before the bus loads of tour groups get there. Tulum is also close by. As this entire area has been targeted for development, there is a lot of fun activities to choose from.In conclusion, RIU Palace is a great resort. The service is excellent unlike Beaches Negril, which is almost 2X RIU Palace's cost, was poor. With a young family, we really missed Barcel\u00f3 Maya. We came back to the Mayan Riviera because we had such a great time at Barcel\u00f3 Maya in February. The beach at Barcel\u00f3 Maya is as long as the beach stretching from RIU Playcar to RIU Yucatan with RIU Palace and another hotel in between. The kids club at Barcel\u00f3 Maya was right on the beach and close to the swimming pool. The swimming pool at Barcel\u00f3 was slightly warmer and much larger with a free form shape. If you have a young family, consider Barcel\u00f3 Maya as an option to RIU Palace.", "Date": "December 27, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood, but far from perfect.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1530304", "Content": "The service at this hotel is great.

We stayed at the Occidental Allegro in April and liked it very much. We went to the Copacabana in June and had rain for all 5 days, so it's hard to know if we liked the place or not. But the Riu Palace......is perfect. I had reviewed all the websites and looked at the pictures. I thought it looked pretty, but actually being there is so much different. The peacefulness is something that can't be seen in pictures. We were welcomed with \"welcome drinks\" upon checkin. Before we arrived at our room (immediately upon arriving at 10:45 am), a third bed had been set up for our 18 year old daughter (without being asked to do so). We had a view of the fountain area which proved to be most pleasant. Each morning we would open our sliding doors to the patio and listen to the breeze and fountains. The resort is quiet so you didn't have alot of yelling or other distractions from the guests. Food was good. The Thursday night \"gala\" was the best buffet night but all of the food, morning, noon and night was good. I liked the fact that all food was served on real glass dishes with nice glassware and silverware. No plastic stuff except on the beach for obvious safety reasons. We enjoyed much of the staff. Very personable and truly interested in our family. Rooms nicer than expected from pictures. There were three of us, and I didn't feel crowded at all. Turn down service each evening was nice. I could go on and on, but the bottom line is, if you've been to other resorts in Playa, you haven't been to the best. I can't imagine ever going anywhere else. Another RIU Palace in another city - yes. If you're wondering if it's worth the extra money going to the RIU Palace vs. the RIU Tequila - absolutely!

I have been to a couple other all inclusive places and a highly rated cruise. The Palace smoked them all. When arriving at the airport, keep your luggage until you find your coordinator (even then keep an eye on it). When we landed, the airport was undergoing reconstruction and had 50 cent Coronas as compensation for the mess. I had 5 not realizing that we had an hour or so to the hotel, luckily there are bathrooms on the bus. The checkin is incredibly smooth and you will not need to change rooms. I think we got one of the worst views, ours overlooked the neighboring resort, all we could see was the seperating tree line. Not only did this not bother us, it came in handy. The grounds are impecible. You could quite literally eat off the tile walkways without worrying about getting sick (I didn't actually try this). They are washed twice a day, the shrubbery and lawn is also detailed pretty much on a daily basis. You will not find chipped or yellowing paint. If the paint is supposed to be white, it is a glimmering white. This place is surrounded by other Riu's. You can visit those anytime you like - one of them has a night club that is fun, but don't bother with the restraunts. The Palace has a nightly show - we had an Ode to Michael Jackson that was awesome. Since the Palace is rated higher than the others, those guests cannot use anything at the Palace. Their grounds are much different, more of a tiki theme. Still incredibly nice but no where near the class of the Palace. The rooms are fantastic. You will have a mini bar that includes 4 bottles (tequilla - duh, rum, vodka and something else) they are replaced as needed. Your mini fridge is stocked daily or as often as you call, with Corona, water, soda, etc. Beds are a little harder (ok, a lot) than we were used to, we just put a couple blankets down under the sheets though and that solved it. Oh, they only offer two twin beds pushed together or seperate. There is a little sitting area and a tv. We hardly used the sitting area and never turned on the tv. We didn't spend a whole lot of time in our rooms. Restraunts: If you went to a similar restraunt in Boston (similar to any of the 4 or 5 offered) expect to pay well over $100 for two people. Every dinner was fantastic. Huge selection, different every night at the main restraunt. The other restraunts are more themed and should not be missed. You need to plan to go early that day by making reservations (to the themed restraunts- it is very simple), we were never declined - always got a table. We had a bottle of wine or two every night, I reccommend the Calafel. Unfortunately, I can't find it in the states. An entire entry should be made on the staff alone. You will probably never experience anything of this caliber again (unless you come back). Your waiter will know your names and drink preferences within a few minutes and have everything ready for you by the time you get to your table (if you eat in the main dining room - they'll explain it when you get there). The cleaning staff are some of the nicest people around. I went looking for an ice machine and I never made it. My bucket was taken from me, I was sent back to my room and they brought the ice to me. I never did find the ice machine. I could only make it about 4 doors away before someone would spot me. Basically, you will absolutely not have a bad experience with anyone that works at the Palace. You do not have to tip in order to get better service - in fact they can not be seen taking tips. I would do it discreetly anyway, you will not find anything close to their customer ethics in the states. Drinks: If you want top shelf, just ask. They make your drink to order. The swim up bar is the most enjoyable, I don't think I need to explain why. If you want something other than mixed drinks you can get bottles of wine, champagne (both delivered to your room via room service if you want) or beer. The only beer they have is Corona, which I was estatic about. Beach: The beach is a bit of a walk from the hotel (by bit I mean at most a few hundred yards). You will walk through a grove of palm trees that have several hammocks strung between them and eventually hit the lounging area. There is a beach bar but no one brings you drinks - but with all the food you will be eating, you will be grateful for the little bit of execise. You can sign out all kinds of water stuff while at the beach - hobies, boogie boards, etc. We discovered that if you want to use something longer than the allotted hour (very loosely enforced) you should bring a few Coronas with you from your room. Beer has amazing bargaining power. If you decided to go para-sailing, definately bring a few with you, either that or another 10 bucks or so. The ride is normally 5-8 minutes for somewhere around $50. I threw in a six pack and we went for almost 30 minutes (you actually have to bring it to the boat though, don't believe the guys you bought the excursion through). Got a cruise of the entire shore all the way to the town and back. Lounging on the beach is great. Don't bother bringing a snorkel down because there is nothing to see and the water is cloudy (its a beach, not a cove), the water however, is incredibly warm. It rained (actually a huricane hit) one day while we were there. Unfortunately, if the harbor closes, the resorts are required to close their beaches as well. All this means is that you can't take out equipment. This was the only bad thing I can think of for the entire trip - there were finally waves and we couldn't use boogie boards. So, we spent several hours learning how to body surf. Excursions: we did several - Diving - made a couple of dives off Cozumel. I expected a little more after all I've read about it but one of our dives definately met my expectations. When getting teamed up with a leader, look for the one that appears a little crazy. If your dive master isn't quite right in the head you will probably have a much better dive. We went down a little over 80 feet and found a tunnel about 6 feet in diameter that ran several hundred yards through the coral. And it was packed with life, rather hard to swim through without touching anything, but if you are careful, it can be done. We quite literally ran into a fish that was bigger than we were who refused to yield so we had to turn around and take another off shoot. The other dives couldn't really follow that and so I was kind of bored. Bring along something to eat - you will be provided lunch but you will probably want something more. DIVE THE SENOTES!!!!!!!!!! This really has to be experienced as words will not do it justice. Kind of like swimming in a sponge, more or less a cave dive. On this dive I wouldn't reccommend a crazy guide. We went to a couple of Mayan ruins - Tulum was cool - also got to go to a park of sorts (still all inclusive if you spring the extra 20 bucks - do it). We also went to another ruin, can't recall the name (shouldn't have waited so long to write a review) but its the biggest one around. Has thousands of ruins and the largest pyramid unearthed. Also has the ball court. You will have the option of walking the mile to the ruins, renting a bike or renting a bike with a guy to peddle if for you. Walking is free, renting your own bike is two or three bucks, and getting the rickshaw is 4 bucks a person. We got the rickshaw and it was worth it. The guy spoke English pretty well and kept us well entertained with a lot of the local history. I would also read a little bit about Mayan prophecies and technology before you go as well - incredibly interesting. If you go on this you also get to go through the rain forest and do a zip line, feed crocs, rappell into a senote (much different than what you would dive) and float around on inner tubes, canoe and learn a whole bunch about the area. I would do this one instead of Tulum. A group of indigenous people will make you lunch, while your guide won't get sick you probably will. (I did, but thankfully it didn't kick in until we were back home so my trip was unaffected) Montezumah is not a friendly fellow and if you can politely figure out a way to decline the dinner, I would. Remember to bring something to eat though because its an all day trip. I would reccommend not doing as many excursions as we did and save a lot of time to sit around and relax. We exhausted ourselves (in a good way) because we wanted to see as much as we could. I will definately go back to the Palace. I have been trying to find another Carribbean vacation for this year but I can't find another all inclusive resort that even comes close to this one. The Palace is definately worth the extra money - which by the way, really wasn't that much - we paid about 3G total (airfare, excursions, hotel, meal and drinks, etc). Oh, I almost forgot - at night you can get a massage on the beach. I think there are 1/2 hour and hour long sessions. You have the option of being under a very very thin tent of sorts (almost lace) or under the stars. They post a whole bunch of tiki torches around as well - if I remember correctly, it was about 70 bucks a person for the hour and you'll probably throw in another 10 for a tip. The torches are the only lights around that affect your sight so you will see more stars than you ever thought possible. We did this on our last night and it was the perfect ending. feel free to email me questions if you are considering going to playcar or want to know more about the Palace - jessman409@hotmail.com", "Date": "December 21, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat Vacation\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1513501", "Content": "My wife and I had a great time there.

Sir Edwards was OK. Don Julian has enough selection and the the food is fine. Service is good throughout the property. I would recommend bringing a stack of about $50-60 in singles to tip extras.

Those are the two words that I have to describe the Riu Palace! My husband and I (27, 30) stayed at the Riu Palace September 1-15 for our honeymoon. I would highly recommend spending 2 weeks at this resort as one week would have not been enough for us! Before booking at the Riu Palace, we had looked into almost every resort along this area. At first, I will admit that I was not 100% sure after making our reservations, but our travel agent assured us that we would love the Riu Palace. The grounds are immaculate and spotless! The workers work very hard to keep all of the grounds and doors spotless. One morning we were up at 7AM, and they were all in the courtyard scrubbing the floors with soap and water...Unbelievable! The rooms are very spacious and the beds are not as bad as soom reviews have said they were. We managed to get one of the few rooms that are facing the ocean (partial views). Some words of warning would be \"DO NOT USE THE HOTEL TELEPHONES TO CALL HOME...BUY A PREPAID PHONE CARD\". The telephone company will charge you $21/3 minutes and $2 every minute after that! Complete rip off! I learned the hard way with a $500 phone bill, so if I can stop others from having this happen to them, it will be well worth the experience! Another thing to watch out for is the DJ at the Riu Tequila. Do not request any songs because he will not play them and he has an anger problem and belongs in an Anger Management course.Those were the only 2 negative factors of the resort. It's not worth checking out the other Riu's as the Riu Palace is the best one! You could go check out the other Riu's - it'll reinforce what a great decision you've made to stay at the Riu Palace.Each night there was entertainment at 10PM. We really enjoyed the shows and we also really enjoyed sitting in the courtyard and ordering drinks throughout the evening. My favourite drink was the Miami Vice and the Batilda De Cocoa...YUMMY!!!!The Beach was BEAUTIFUL! Clear turquois water and soft white sand. There were lots of lounge chairs so no real need to get out early to \"save your chair\". There are also lounge chairs in the shaded areas under the trees as well. The only thing I didn't like was the Jet Ski's..the gas smell was obnoxious and so was the noise!!!!!! I really hope that one day they ban the Jet Ski's so that they don't come so close to the Beach area!The Staff at the Riu Palace will treat you like Royalty! When you're there, say hi to Dio and Jimmy(Entertainers, Aqua Aerobics. Salvatore, Eduardo and Omar are AMAZING! We really got to know the staff really well. Tell them that Connie and Jason from Canada say \"hello\". The Food at the resort is AMAZING! We tried all of the restaurants...the only thing is that I don't think they change their menu at the Specialty restaurants (El Patio,Sir Edward,La Bodega). If you are a meat lover, you definetly have to try La Bodega! We've never experienced anything like it!We ate at Don Julian often, and never got bored or sick of the food there! There is always a wide variety and it's not your typical buffet where everything tastes the same. Don Julian will host \"Specialty Nights\" and it's well worth dining during those nights! Keep in mind to pack some nice outfits as there is a dress code for dinner. Breakfast is Amazing! There is a fresh juicebar with different types of Juices (Banana Milk, Pineapple Banana..etc..), fresh fruit, croissants..smoked salmon..everything and ANYTHING!!!!We will definetly go back in a heartbeat! there is so much more to write about...if you have any questions, please feel free to send me an email at msconnienguyen@hotmail.com.

Hope I don't ramble but here's the lowdown: We visited last week 12/2 thru Sat 12/6. thru Apple Vacations. Let me just say for first time travellers to Cancun's airport- after deboarding the plane, head downstairs straight to the baggage carousel- do not pass go, do not collect money! The official looking people with light blue shirts and laminated badges @ their necks are looking for starry eyed first timers like you. They will distract you to their counters in order to lure you into a tour or time share. Second, the people outside the airport waiting to \"handle\" your luggage are worse- they practically tried to take my luggage out of my hands. The airport should be disgraced. Luckily I was able to spot our red flowery shirted Apple rep & he saved us. OK the good part- after that- no worries mon. Rained the first day- after that sunny with a breeze and mid to low 80's- perfect. Kudos to those recommending bringing a thermos. I brought a 1/2 galloon jug. No need to tell you what happens to the human body after pouring in a 1/2 gallon of Pina Coladas in 3 hours. Needless to say I got pretty sick- not the hotels fault though. We tipped the maid @ $2 everyday- got a towel turtle & the beds turned down every night. When appropriate I tipped the waiters/ waitresses @ $2-$3 at a time- they are the hardest working bunch of people you will meet. We got to know the head waiter Carlos- truly a very good person. I didn't want to leave the beach at all, but we did book a snorkelling tour which was pretty much off the beaten path thru the Apple rep who was in the lobby every day. Worth every penny (The Mayan Adventure tour I think) This is a resort which caters to adults & probably serves @ 50% European clientel. There are lots of other reorts who cater more to kids and if we come back with our young ones we'll pick a different place. In the meantime, it was nice having Mommy & Daddy get a little dressed up for dinner for a change. We're in our 30's and amongst the youngest couples there. I'd say the main age group was in their late 40's to early 50's. I sure didn't mind this as it cut down on the rowdy boorish behavior. If you don't like smoke, keep an eye out for who is sitting next to you at dinner or at a show- they light them up anywhere. We ate at La Traviata, El Patio, La Bodega & Don Julian (didn't get to Sir Edward). Honestly, I wouldn't have minded eating the nightly buffets @ Don Julian every night. Plenty of selection between Mexican, Mediterranean & European. I will say that no matter where you eat, all the beef dishes pretty much have the same seasoning- pretty good though. If you are a tea drinker be warned- I couldn't find any! No Coke products. Soft drinks are pretty much Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, 7-Up, & and an orange soda like Fanta called Mirinda (sp?) Didn't get to the other Riu's, but when you're in the Palace- really who cares? Took a trip down to 5th Ave in Playa Del Carme (@ a $4-$5 taxi ride) and bought some trinkets. You'll find better deals here rather than at the hotel or in the very convenient market/ strip center @ 200 yards north across the street. Basically this is paradise. I've been in hotels & resorts from Anchorage, Alaska to West Palm Beach, Florida & considering the food, drink, accomodations, service & of course, cost- this one wins hands down.

If you are wavering back and forth on which hotel to choose, this is it! We travel often, and hands-down, this was the best room, location, and value. We were NOT disappointed! The location is EXCELLENT! You are in Playacar-- which is a small community within Playa del Carmen of hotels, golf courses, and upperscale homes. There is a shopping area (Playacar Plaza) that we used often. This area is immacuately landscaped and the most beautiful part of Playa del Carmen that we saw. We would stay nowhere else! You can also walk to downtown Playa del Carmen from here, or take a taxi for $4 USD. The beach is MASSIVE! The only advice I have is to go early to get a lounge chair. Although there are tons of chairs, everyone hangs at the beach so you have to go early or watch for people leaving. Otherwise, there are always chairs available at the pool (but why go to the pool when you've got the Carribean??). About food. We're not really picky about our food, but found all of our dinners to be great. There is a wide variety of selections at Don Julian's (the main buffet), and there are four other restaurants that require reservations. You can make your reservations by phone, but make them early. We only ate at the Steakhouse, which was also good. One of the best things about the Riu Palace is that it is surrounded by the other Rius. You have access to all other Riu hotels, beaches, and restaurants in the area. We visited each Riu and would stay at any one. We just don't think you can go wrong. However, the Riu Palace is truly the \"grandest\" of them all, and if you want to treat yourself to luxury, then it is where you want to be. Also, we were amazed at how the hotel was so \"European\". There was a mix of cultures from everywhere, and we found it to be quite \"swank\" and fun to be amongst so many different people! Last, you must go on two tours. The ATV jungle tour (by Chilly Willy's) where you will swim in a cenote, see small ruins, and have fun on ATVs. This is the best small tour we took (only 2 hours). The other, and my favorite, is the Coba-Pac Chen tour by Alltournative. Check out their tours at Alltournative. com. You visit a Mayan village, rapell into a cenote, fly across a lake on a zip-line, kayak, and visit the largest Mayan ruins. It is a MUST-DO!

I should relay a little information about us in order to add perspective to this review. We are both 30 years old and have two children (whom we left with grandparents). We spend most of our vacations on the various ski slopes of North America but have spent a few days in warm-weather sites in the US and Caribbean. I travel quite a bit on business and so I get to sample hotels all over the US and occasionally in Europe. This was our first trip to the Yucatan and our first experience at an all-inclusive resort. We were looking for a relaxing, laid-back vacation and the Palace delivered. The resort facilities are first-class. The reception area, bars, dining rooms, and other common areas are well appointed and air-conditioned. The pool was wonderfulperfectly cleanwith plenty of loungers for relaxation. We had a first floor standard room near the pool facing the courtyard. The rooms are well furnished with standard hotel-class furniture and are larger than standard hotel rooms in the US (think junior suite) with separate sleeping and sitting areas. The beds are indeed a little on the firm side of hard but that didnt seem to affect how we slept and actually proved to be an asset for other activities. The mini-bar was always well stocked and service was responsive to requests. Service also did a great job of keeping the room immaculately clean despite our best efforts to spread sand around the room. I was a little disappointed with how thin the walls werethe people above us spent several early mornings arguing over what to do that day and the people to our right threw a couple parties during the week to which we did not receive and invitebut to be fair we did have the outside door open most of the time and the sound may have originated from there. The beach was spectacular. The sand was white and clean and the water was clear and warm. The palm grove between the building and the beach is a nice touch. We spent several hours during the day and at night after dinner lounging in the hammocks. We werent overly impressed with the on-site water recreation shop that is independently owned and operated. We did find it inconvenient that we could not charge activities to our room (they only accept cash) and we found the prices a little on the steep side. We tried a catamaran one afternoon which was a lot of fun despite our being noviceswe didnt tip over and we made it back to the beach so we classified it as a success. We also went on one of the snorkeling excursions but would not recommend it to others. If you want to snorkel you can go into town and find excursions that are less expensive and take you to more placesa fact we didnt discover until later that day. We also took the SCUBA certification classes and the first two divesthe last dive being cancelled because of a passing hurricane. You can find cheaper SCUBA classes and dives in town but we found it more convenient to utilize the on-site service. We found the food at the Palace to be only above average. The resort caters more to the European palette of which my spouse and I are not particularly fond, however, due to the incredible selection we were always able to find something we did like. We did find La Bodega to be the best restaurant of the group. We had a bad experience at El Patio, the steakhouse, due to a guest who insisted on going through a couple Monte Cristos during dinner and a manager who refused to reseat us. We liked the dress code for dinner and thought it really helped make dinner an event. We came prepared with Dockers and polos for myself and some slinky evening dresses for my spouse (note to guys: figure in the cost of some new evening wear into the overall cost of your vacation as the investment yields excellent returns). We didnt like the assigned seating and meal times because changing either of the two proved to be something of a hassle. We did not stick around for any of the evening entertainment so I cannot comment on it. The reason I do not give the Palace the highest rating is I feel the service is not comparable to other hotels at which Ive stayed. On a service level the Palace cannot compare to the likes of a Four Seasons, St. Regis, Hotel Jerome, or Waldorf Astoriaor even some of the nicer Marriott hotels and resorts. The above-mentioned incident at El Patio was just one of several that took place during the week. We would not recommend taking younger children to the Palace (our 4 and 6 year-olds would have been miserable) as there are not any programs for them.

We were put in a terrible room at first--view of the roof with the air conditioner compressor making noise constantly. Plus, it smelled very musty. We called and asked to be moved. They were very understanding, and moved us as soon as they could (the next day). Everyone in the hotel is courteous and polite, and they all want to do their best for you! Our housekeeper even made an armadillo out of towels and washcloths for us, even made eyes and a mouth and stuck them on! It was so cute!The food is good at Don Julian, but I recommend making reservations at any of the other restaurants (La Bodega, Sir Edward or El Patio) for dinner. The food in the other restaurants is top-notch and served wonderfully, while the food in Don Julian is only passable, especially when compared to the other three. Lunch is good anywhere. The nice thing is you can get food 24-7 somewhere, so if you have the munchies in the middle of the night, no problem.The evening shows were entertaining, and it is so nice to sit outside and be served non-stop drinks while enjoying the warm night breeze.We were not really interested in night-life, so if you are looking for night-life you may want to look somewhere else.

Each staff member is delightful and extremely professional. Rooms are wonderful. The standard room has king/double beds and a sitting area with patio. Each room has a small mini liquor service as well as refrigerator with beers/sodas/water. The rooms were adequately cool with ceiling fans and a/c and kept very clean without a hint of ants or lizzards (yes lizzards).

I was impressed with the resort the first time, but the second time around, it really did exceeded my expectations. The place has changed and it changed for the best.CHECK-IN: Once we arrived at the airport, we were already outside of the airport in 10 minutes. The luggage came out right away and soon we were picked up by a van from Apple Vacations. The ride to the resort was about 45 minutes, but it was nice and smooth ride in an air-conditioned van. When we got to the hotel, went to the reception desk and we were assigned a room. The whole check-in process took no more than 3 minutes and we were given a nice refreshing drink at the counter. We were assigned a room number 0037. Thats on the first floor on the right looking out the outside of the hotel. That was the room that I requested, but when we got to the room, my wife didnt like the location. I liked it, but she didnt. I called the reception and asked them to change the room in the same building on the first floor looking out on the courtyard. Without any hesitation they gave us another room 0061. Once we got to the room, the bellboy was already waiting for us there. Of course he got a tip from me. The check-in was very fast, courteous and did I say fast?SERVICE: The service was absolutely brilliant. Riu Palace has a lot of staff on hand and everyone is there to help you. Whatever your request is, they will fulfill it. They will always greet you with a smile and theyll know your name after the first time you tell them. They dont forget. The best part about it is that they dont expect to get a tip from you. Theyre just nice by nature. Its in their job to be nice and courteous. For example, we were sitting outside on the plaza and drinking cocktails. Before I was finished with my Kalhua and Cream, one of the waiters brought out another one without me asking for it. It felt great and it wasnt a rare occurrence. It was happening all the time on the plaza, in the restaurant, dinner, the pool, etc. The staff is very friendly and they will meet your any demand. I was tipping waiters all the time and it was all worth it. I spent about $40 in tips and for that kind of money, you can not buy a better service.ROOM: The room was great. It was overlooking the courtyard in front of the fountains. The bed was made 2 times a day. First time after you wake up and the second time before you go to bed. I dont get that at home. In any case, the room was always clean and the cleaning people left all these cute animals in the room. They made a big swan on our bed the first day. They made a heart out of 2 little swans in the bathroom. They also made an elephant, a doll and an opossum on our bed. I took pictures of them and I wish I could share them with you, because you had to see it to believe it. It was beautiful. Always plenty of towels, soap and shampoo. The remote control from our TV didnt work the first day, I called the reception and we had a working remote control within 5 minutes. Our air conditioner wasnt blowing cold air and it was fixed within 10 minutes. If you find anything wrong during your stay, call the reception and it will be fixed within minutes. Its their job to provide an exceptional service to their guests. Thats why 40% of their guests come back there over and over again and Im one of them.FOOD: Oh my god. There was so much food and everything was so delicious. They concentrate on European guests more than on Americans, but they had something for everybody. Im originally from Russia, but live in the states for the past 15 years and I was able to just about anything. A lot of vegetables, fruits, meats, seafood, etc.. For breakfast they had 5 and 10 minute boiled eggs, fried eggs any style, omelets, bacon, sausages, fried bananas, breakfast quesidillas, fried potatoes, donuts, pancakes, French toast, any kind of bread you can imagine, deli meats, butter, cream cheese, 10 different kinds of cheeses, smoked salmon (my favorite), 20 different types of cereal, juice bar and a fruit and sweets station. Is that enough for breakfast? I think so. If you cant find something to eat there, youre just very picky and no other place will please you. For lunch we were going to either La Traviata or El Patio. It was good in both places. They had burgers, hot dogs, chicken, beef, Buffalo wings, fries, pasta, pizza, veggies, cold sandwiches and so much other stuff. For dinner we were going to Don Julian. The food was great there. Im not going to describe everything that they were serving, but Ill just mention the best parts. During the Caribbean Night they were serving lobster, jumbo shrimp, mussels, clams and it were all simmered in some sort of yummy sauce. It was soooo good. Other food that I really enjoyed were pork cordon bleu, seafood kabobs, a salad with crab and pine apples, pasta with seafood, turkey at the carving station, lasagna and so much more. Once we went to Sir Edward and the food was very good there. My wife had roasted duck and I had pork chops. For the appetizer we both had lobster bisque. The food was excellent everywhere and there was always something for everybody.POOL: Pool was always very clean and never crowded. At the swim up bar there were always at least 2 bartenders there, so you never had to wait for a drink. The side with a swim up bar had more people than the other side, but it makes sense, people will go where free drinks are. Also at the bar and in the room they upgraded their liquor since the last time I was there. They now serve Smirnoff vodka instead of some cheap Mexican vodka. They also upgraded their Gin, Baccardi, Tequilas and beer (Coronas now). Always plenty of sun and shade at the pool and always plenty of available lounge chairs. I was playing bingo and volleyball in the pool almost every day. One day they had a fashion show by the pool and it was a lot of fun.BEACH: The beach was the best part. Just imagine, youre walking on a white sandy beach, youre surrounded by palm trees and the sounds of calm turquoise water. Intrigued yet? You will not find a single rock or a shell in the send or in the water. The beach at Riu Palace is considered to be the 2nd best beach in Mexico. Always lots of lounge chairs in the sun or in the shade. Never crowded. There was a little bar at the beach, so you could always get a cold drink there. Plenty of activities like volleyball, snorkeling, sailing, parasailing, scuba diving and even massages. My wife got a massage at the new spa that they built. It was $60 for 50 minutes for a full body massage, but they also had a Moonlight massage. This massage is for couples. At night you go to the beach and both of you are lying there on the massage tables on the sand near the water. Candles are lit around you and youre getting a massage together. Very romantic and peaceful. I think it was $170 for both. One night we went to the beach and there was a couple getting that massage around 10 oclock at night and under a moon lit sky. That night I went swimming in the water and it was great.DEPARTURE: Departure was the worst part of our trip. Nothing went wrong and the check out was very fast, but knowing that you have to leave this absolute beauty and perfection and have to go home to work, made me realize how great Riu Palace is. It was my 2nd time there and Im sure that I will be back there again. Ive been to a lot of places in Caribbean and I try to stay at top of the line resorts, but nothing can match the beauty, service, perfection and everything that Riu has to offer. Came back home at 11 oclock at night last night and Im already sitting at work and writing this report. How sad, but I know that I will be back there again, unless there is another resort that can offer what Riu Palace can. I dont think there is another one like that now, but may be some day there will be one.In conclusion, the difference between a good resort and an excellent one is only a couple of hundred dollars. I think its well worth paying that extra money for such an unforgettable week of pure perfection.Im sure that Im forgetting something, but you get my point.

We had booked our stay at the Riu Playacar. Apon arrival at the Playacar we were informed it was our lucky day and that an over booking was forcing us to be upgraded to the Palace. Our lucky day it was! If anyone is trying to decide if the extra money to stay at the Palace is worth it...it is!!! The resort is beautiful. We had a room closer to the pool on the outside facing another resort (the Maya I think). If you are a light sleeper you may want to change sides. Those folks LOVE DISCO over there and they love it till the wee hours at that! We had no problems ourselves but others might. The beds were firm but comfortable by our standards. We enjoyed the food always finding something that was nice. We especially liked breakfast. The smoothy bar was an excellent touch. The line to sign up for reservations at the other restaraunts intimidated our laziness so we didn't make it to any of them. Oh well. We heard from other guests that they were nice. The beach was splendid. The sand was like powder. We were originally concerned by reviews we had read that implied that it would be ALL older couples. Not so. There were many younger people during the time of our stay. Many Americans as well. The service was excellent. We tipped our servers and bartenders and they appreciated it. They say the tip is included but seeing as these people work twelve hour days, six days a week it was our pleasure to provide the extra gratuity. Their pleasant and friendly attitude was a treat. Making sure to take a lot of one dollar bills is a good idea. We highly recommend taking a thermal cup with a lid on your vacation. The bars by the pool and beach serve small plastic cups. The drinks get hot quickly and full of sand if you aren't careful. We took our thermoses and only needed them filled once before heading to the beach. Handy!!! The entertainment staff worked very hard again with a very upbeat and positive attitude. It wasn't all our cup of tea but appreciated nonetheless. If you go to Playa Del Carmen to shop we recommend buying your jewely from the smaller outside vendors. The larger, enclosed and airconditioned shops will charge you more and their sales people can be very aggresive. We took two tours during our stay. One was to Chichen Itza. It was the highlight of our trip. It is a very long day so be prepared. We had a fantastic guide who offered a lot of insight into the history and current condition of the Maya people. Very eye opening. The other trip we took was also through Lomas but we recommend against it. We went on a trimarand to snorkle. The boat and the crew were terrific. It seemed like we had way too many people until we saw other boats with even more people packed on to them. The reef was very, very sad. It has been destroyed. Even though the guide admonished the snorkelers to not touch or kick the reef, people were standing on and kicking the coral constantly. Dead coral, few fish and an overly packed boat. Next time we will go to Cozumel as we heard it was better. Long review but I could go on and on.

If you're expecting world-class, and used to getting it, there are a few problem areas. The spa is one, do not trust anything they tell you, ONLY agree to get services listed in a brochure. And WATCH OUT for the spa's blonde receptionist. She hid the specials from me (I found out about them from another guest, and told her I knew about them, so she had to show me). I made my appointments, and there was something I wanted in the display case (sunless tanning - I'm very fair) pointed it to her and asked her how much, and she said 700 pesos. I agreed, then halfway through the service, the lady perfomring the service told me to put on my bathing suit, I asked for what, and found out the I had been exfoliated for the wrong service! I went out to the glass case, and the product had been removed from the case, and they told me they could only do regular tanning. (How ridiculous is that?) I asked her why did she say 700 pesos earlier when I pointed to the product, and she said 700 pesos was for regualr tanning. I told her that was not what I wanted, that I had pointed to what I wanted, and she said since they had already started I had to pay. It was terrible! I had her call the front desk, I complained to multiple staff, all of whom pretended not to understand. They kept saying the same thing over and over \"Was a service performed?\" And I kept trying to tell them yes, but not the one I agreed to. I finally got frustrated, didn't finish the service, and paid, since we had another 10 days left I didn't want to ruin the vacation, so I paid with a credit card with fraud protection, and wrote \"miscommunication - to be fixed\" on the receipt. I'll just dispute it, then explain the situation to someone who understands English! Enough about that, generally the hotel, the food, the staff and the rooms are great. If you're used to world-class, you'll get it most of the time, but be prepared - it looks world class, but it's not. The inability to solve a simple and obvious problem is inexcusable.

For those planning on going to this resort (or any other resort) with toddlers, here is a suggestion that I found very helpful. At the resort meals are served only at designated meal times. This can be difficult for those families travelling with toddlers, because toddlers eat when THEY feel like eating. I took some disposable tupperware and tooke some food at the meal times so that my girls could have some food when they felt like eating. This worked out really well because I didn't feel stressed to feed my girls only at the meal times and it didn't turn out to be a wrestling match.

(The hotel doesn't have any umbrellas either, not that we would have gone out in the down pours, but it would have been useful on a few other days that it rained for a short period of time.) FOOD: we tried all of the restaurants so this gave us a variety throughout our stay which we would recommend otherwise the buffets could get old after awhile. Definitely go up early to make reservations or call the desk. ROOM: as other reviewers have said, the beds are VERY hard so be prepared. We did ask for extra blankets that helped. It was a very nice room and the service was excellent. GROUNDS: The grounds were spectacular and kept very neat. The staff was always cleaning things while we were there. POOL: There was always empty lounge chairs by the pool for us so you didn't have to worry about saving any. You can leave your key at the desk so you won't lose it.

The service and attention to detail are amazing. The staff can not do enough to help you and are always very cheerful despite the very long hours that they work. The buffet has a good mix of food and will have something to suit everyone but there are three other restaurants you can use in the evening so we tried to vary where we went. By far the most popular of these is the 'Sir Edward' which is an excellent a la carte restaurant. The bookings for this are taken at 12 o'clock but in the 2 weeks we were there you had to be in line by 11.15am to have a choice of sitting as there are not many tables. It is well worth the effort as the food is amazing. The evening entertainment is quite low key with the hotel band playing from 8.30 to 9.30 and then a show at 10pm. This suited us fine as we wanted a relaxing quite holiday but won't suit those looking for any night life. The beach is amazing and the sea is really clear although a little rough. Sun beds are available on the beach and around the pool at any time of the day so there is no need to reserve them. We went on a couple of excursions to Chitzen Itza, Tulam, Xel-ha and swimming with dolphins. By far the best of these was Xel-ha.
