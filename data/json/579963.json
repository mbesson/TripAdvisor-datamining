The rooms are not in the worst condition, all of the furniture is old, small beds, dirty chairs, brown panel on the walls. Bathroom was clean, but the toilet seat was years old and badly stained, carpet needs to be replaced, wall air conditioner that barely got cold, still using the old tv in the rooms for entertainment, no frig or microwave in room. The best of are trip has been the beach, boardwalk, the motel is a bad experience. I booked three nights and decided I wanted to leave after two, the motel would not refund me for the third night although the place is a dump and not comfortable. Riviera management got my money this time but will never get it it again. They offer a cheaper rate than most motels OC, but your not getting a deal if the room isn't comfortable. Take my advice pay 20 to 30 more and stay at a nicer motel. It may be a good idea to ask to see the room before making the reservation. DO NOT STAY AT THE RIVIERA MOTEL IN OCEAN CITY, MARYLAND.

That was a horrible choice. I was very unsatisfied. Let's start with the room. Most of the drawers fell out when you pull them, the beds had alot of weird stains, and the bathroom had dirty black specks in it. The pool was okay, the first few days had a ton of leaves in the pool. The hallway was really dirty, the carpet was ripped and teared and had smelly stains everywhere. I was wondering why they didn't PUT any room pictures on the website. Obviously when you look at the outside, it seems amazing by the bright colors. Wrong again. The rooms we booked were all different. One with 3 beds, one with 2, one with a couch, one without one; even though we asked for the same rooms. The air conditioning was perfect for a hot day.

It is the prefect place to rent a room if you are coming to the resort for a few days and don't have any reservation previously made. It has everything what a good accomodation must provide for the people to have great time: clean bathroom, nice porch, spacy bedroom with big beds (so big that five people can sleep in a room for two). The statement that the mattresses are lumpy is absolutely rubbish. And that after you stay in the room for a day your hair gets curl sound pretty amazing for me, isn't it? Besides that you are there not to stay in the room whole day but to enjoy the beach and the ocean. And it just 6 feet from your doorstep, you just have to cross the boardwalk and ... wide beachvolley grounds, sun umbrellas all over, different colours but still a lot of space for everybody. Next to the motel is working handsome guy , always very polite, renting bodyboards to try the waves if you want , there is paraplaning and so on.... I can not say anything to complain about the motel staff : there is all the time someone at the reception to help you if you need somethng , the night shift person is very big guy, russian, who can deal easily with all drunk tourists returning from the clubs and interrupting renters' sleep. There is houskeeping every other day. The swimming pool is big indeed and I have never seen somebody sleeping on the lounges next to it. May be there are one or two empty beer cans on the parking lot but the people are there also to party , don't you think?
