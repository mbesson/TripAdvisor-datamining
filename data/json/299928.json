{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great find! We absolutely LOVED staying here ! This little pensione is quiet respite from the hot teeming streets of Florence. Our host was friendly and helpful, and the room was spacious, clean and comfortable. Also, the LOCATION was perfect ! You are RIGHT in the center of things, steps form the Duomo and other attractions of Florence. We (a young married couple) enjoyed coming home to the comforts of this hotel, and you really can't beat the price!", "Date": "Oct 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR190238319", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "RobsterVentura_CA"}, {"Content": "Excellent Value - Friendly Service - Great Location! I can't say enough good things about this place. For the price, you can't beat it. It is not a 5 star hotel so if you need that go elsewhere and pay dearly for it. It was very clean, and VERY quiet - I couldn't believe how quiet. Especially considering you walk out the door, and about one block down is the duomo. It is centrally located for everything siteseeing-wise. The lady is very friendly and speaks good english. The shower is small - but let's face it - welcome to Europe. If you are going to Florence to sitesee and want a budget locale consider this place. For the price it doesn't get any better. This was my third time going to Florence.Other tips:- Make reservations to go to the Accedemia. Go there - David is amazing even for non art buffs. Download the rick steves audio tour before leaving onto your ipod.- Go to gellateria Grom near the Duomo.- Beware of pickpockets in Florence!!!- The Bargello museum was amazing.- eat at La Giostra.

It was our 4th hotel in Italy in 2 weeks and the most expensive and least desirable. . Although our room was quite large and very clean it was older then previous hotes. It has been awhile since we used a key to lock and leave at desk. I did like the big bathtub. The lobby furniture defintely needed to be replaced as was well worn. It had an old tired feeling to it with no real character.The staff wasa helpfulThe breakfast brunch was very good with a great selection. I would not stay here again as got less for our value here and the lobby makes a poor impression..

We had a shared bathroom, which was new, large and very clean. The hotel is an easy walk to the Duomo. We walked everywhere in Florence and didn't find it hard. The room was comfortable. Staff were very friendly and extremely helpful, ask them where the best place to eat nearby is and make sure you try the local specialty, the name escapes me now, but its basically a very think soup, and its very nice and filling. There were some building restorations going on, but apart from the scafolding out the front of the hotel which obscured the entrance a little we didn't notice it at all. Would stay there for another short visit, but if we were stying longer would probably get a room with an ensuite, its just easier.", "Date": "Nov 22, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR157166465", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "KAEL"}, {"Content": "Just a place to sleep If you're just looking for a place to sleep, this is fine for the price. In peak season, my friend and I were able to book a room the night before for one night.

Considering the fact that we were in Florence to experience the city and not the hotel/hostel, it was an easy and relatively cheap place to spend the night.

I saw many people complaining about the noise coming from the street that the rooms were on but I did not expect that it to be that loud, there is no way you can get a sleep of good quality in that. Everything smells like bleach so they do not care about customers' health with those two things. I saw an interphone so I rang the bell a couple of times until I get the answer, I did not get any answer but a buzz. The woman (who said, It is not my problem. to other customer with the previous review.) was very upset that I rang more than once, saying, Once is enough! in a very arrogant tone. She made me apologize 3 times more, mentioning it again and again. In the area of apology, it seems that once is not enough. She remained hostile through the stay and told us what to do in so many ways. We asked for a room away from the street but we got rejected even with a baby. In my opinion, person like that should not be in a customer service if little thing like that bothers her that much. It would be worth paying 20-30 Euro more and avoid all this crap.

Yes, the hotel is up a lot of stairs, but so are most budget places in Europe! Once we got to the top (out of breath, with our backpacks) she was friendly and welcoming, and spoke excellent english - far better than our basic italian.

OK, so bear in mind that bad things happen in threes...1. Italian train strike prevents us from getting from Pisa to Firenze2. Bus to Firenze fills up and leaves 10 minutes early (!?) meaning we wait another hour on top of the hour and a half we already waited.3. Pensione CanadaWhen we knew we were going to have a little trouble getting to the hotel I phoned at 2pm to let the hotel know we were going to be late but were definitely coming. The nice lady on the phone reassured me that there would be no problem.Upon arrival and a bit of a search we phoned again to get directions - fortunately we were REALLY close to the hotel! See you in 2 minutes I said cheerfully...After lugging our baggage up 3 flights of stairs the nice lady greeted us with the travellers least favourite hotelier phrase... We have a problem - there is no room available for you followed up by the Firenze welcome it's not my problem!So that paints a picture. After a stand up international row in 2 languages we made her realise that the couple who we were about to take our room, were not in fact the people who had booked the room! The hotel? Almost bearable, I suppose for a bathroom share, non air-conditioned basic accommodation.
