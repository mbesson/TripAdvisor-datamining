{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Lily Room has spectacular views My girlfriend and I absolutely loved our stay at Alam Indah. The breakfasts were delicious and the atmosphere at the hotel is among the best in Ubud. What better way to experience Balinese culture and Ubud then from Alam Indah. We stayed in the Lily Room which was very private and had tremendous views of the river valley. The bathroom is enormous!My only complaint is that the pool lounge areas were dirty and needed to be cleaned.", "Date": "Jan 7, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR862014390", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "nicelynicely"}, {"Content": "Absolutely fantastic       Monkey forest temple", "Date": "Jan 2, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR612590550", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Cirrusjoy"}, {"Content": "Beware the Downstairs Room Alam Indah is one of the most beautiful hotels I have ever been to. The staff was fantastic and the property breath taking. That said, we had a downstairs room, The Lotus, and we were repeatedly woken up by the footsteps and chair moving by the people in the room upstairs. There is no sound insulation between the two floors.

Alam Indah is an absolutely gorgeous place which is worth 3 times what you will actually pay for a room there. The giant rooms are filled with amazing carvings and Balinese designs and are also immaculately clean and very comfortable. Most rooms have porches and daybeds so you can lounge outside and enjoy the surroundings. The staff are extremely helpful - meeting every need - serving sumptuous breakfasts (included in the room rate) and afternoon tea or coffee with pastries (also included). There is also a free shuttle into Ubud central. The environment itself is gorgeous - jungle-like, close to the Monkey Forest, full of wonderful animal noises and incredibly tranquil. My husband and I came to Alam Indah on our honeymoon and it was our favorite hotel (and after a long trip in Vietnam, Hong Kong, and Indonesia we had stayed at many). We even stayed a few extra nights - since Alam Indah was full, we stayed at the sister property, Alam Jiwa which was just as gorgeous. This is the first review I have ever written on tripadvisor - I was prompted to do so by my wonderful experience - stay at Alam Indah - it is fabulous!", "Date": "Sep 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR518838327", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "auroralouise"}, {"Content": "Know what you're getting into Sorry Alam Indah, but I have to knock you down a notch. I honestly can't believe no one has given you lower than four stars. We booked the Gardenia Suite, supposedly one of the best: a 2-level accommodation with 2 bathrooms and A/C. The downstairs bathroom was dark (think: dungeon) and the shower had these crazy stone carvings for walls. Felt like we walked onto the set of the new Indy movie. A 2-inch-long red hornet was busy building a nest in the curtains down there. So we sealed the door and didn't use that bathroom at all. The downstairs itself was basically useless unless you needed a sofa for friends to crash on. Upstairs was better, but the bed smelled disgusting, like something you'd tolerate only at a very bad youth hostel. The whole place was very humid and at the mercy of the elements as the resort is set deep in the jungle near the river. Staff was friendly, but my wife pointed out to me that it was almost entirely men. This is strange for Bali, where women are usually well represented among hotel staff.As for location, for us it was just too much of a hassle to have to walk through the Monkey Forest every day (and pay the daily fee) to get to Ubud. A certain well-known guidebook notes this walk as a plus. I disagree and suspect the writer did not actually do the commute--certainly not at night when the Monkey Forest is completely unlit and pitchblack. If you forget your flashlight, forget it. You will be taking a taxi back to the hotel.We stayed one night, then switched hotels. If you want to be at a hotel that has been beaten down by the elements, is located deep in the jungle, and is an inconvenient walk from town, this place might be for you. Otherwise, look elsewhere.", "Date": "Sep 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR653805937", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "vizzy12"}, {"Content": "fantastic traditional balinese luxury don't be put off by how cheap this place is - it is absolutely beautiful and you don't need air-con (it's cool enough in ubud) or a tv. rooms are traditionally balinese with great views over the forests and fields. pool is small but perfect as there are only a few rooms. the whole place is just beautiful - we might even retire there !!!!", "Date": "Aug 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR137283955", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "tappers127"}, {"Content": "Ripper value       Open bathroom", "Date": "Mar 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR373224705", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "DST14"}, {"Content": "Very Relaxing and Jungle Feel :)       View from our room", "Date": "Jan 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR445195657", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Snoobles"}, {"Content": "Perfect, Just Perfect We loved this place. My mother was visiting me in Indonesia from the US, and we vacationed in Bali for 4 nights. This place was perfect. I called before a number of times, anxious to have a great room for my Mom (you can choose which room you want, photographs are on their website). The property is beautiful (set in the hills/mountains, not on a rice paddy but their other properties Alam Shaanti and Alam Jiwa are on rice paddies and also look lovely) - decorated with beautiful Balinese furniture and an large bathroom with tub. The room had a perfect porch with a bed and chairs from which we couldn't even see another building, nothing but the green outdoors, flowers and the hills. The service is friendly and helpful. The breakfasts are delicious! Fruit was amazingly fresh, and choices of pancakes, eggs etc all served in this little outdoors cafe. You can walk into Ubud center through the Monkey Forest (about 10 minutes) although we usual just got a ride in one of their vechiles, which are on call all day long to drop off and pick up customers.
