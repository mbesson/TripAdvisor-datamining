I didn't stay - but they still charged me! Upon being shown my room, I realised that this was nowhere near 5 stars. The room was 3x3m, the carpet was dirty, there was a persistent buzzing from a wall fluorescent bulb that could not be turned off. But the main issue was that there was no window. The old fashioned window was covered with opaque vinyl and sealed shut. I know of no possible hotel in Sydney that could call themselves 5 star while having no window, let alone a window that is sealed shut and blacked out. I returned to the front desk immediately and requested another room, happy to to pay more (the room I was staying in cost $200 on Last Minute.). There were no other rooms, so I told the front desk, that I could not possibly stay there and left the hotel. I assumed they would credit my AMEX, but no, I received my statement and there was no reversal. The Kirketon has so far refused to remove the charge for a room which was falsely advertised and in which I did not stay.

OK let's go out for a few hours and kill time.... Return at 2pm to the same 'friendly' receptionist who then after a while standing there said 'how can i help you?' A bit shocked I responded 'we would like to check in?' and then was asked my name again having already given credit card details earlier. When I pointed out that we had already met I was given a curt 'well many people pass by here at reception...it is a hotel' Wow what a change 5 hours makes! Then I was told that there was no lift and he 'hadn't had a chance to get luggage to the room'. He looked panicked that he may be asked to still take the cases so we said we would take them ourselves. When he brought them right around before I had a chance to speak further he looked really irritatated that we wanted to get into the room and drop some shopping and hand luggage first. Great start... Inside the room which IS tiny - regardless of location or room options these are SMALL. There is less then 3 ft of space between the end of the the double bed and the wall. The bathroom was grotty - grey tiles with dull and mouldy grout everywhere. No bath and standard toiletries of shower gel / shampoo / conditioner nothing else (not very boutiquey). Basically my husband summed it up when he said - it is a hostel with some posh trimmings. Harsh but as far as the the standard room is concerned, true. Public areas are better - nice low lighting with interesting and soothing design. There is no room service - unless you count calling reception who will order take away from a local restaurant and deliver to your room at a much elevated price. The internet which is $15AUS per day was not working the entire time I was there (10 long days) so as far as the managements comments on an earlier review about not keeping hard copies of phone books, brochures etc goes - well this was a good example of why you SHOULD keep them. There is no breakfast option - period. Downstairs the restaurant and bar are managed separately. Again most boutique hotels would have this as standard. However the bar is a fun vibrant place to be at night and seemed popular but as this doesn't belong to 8 hotels - kind of irrelevant to this review. The location IS great - very central to Kings Cross / Darlinghurst area which is just as well as if you stay there you will likely want to be out most of the time. The rooms were not serviced well - if at all. Most days somebody came in and made the bed. That was it.... no hoovering - no cleaning in the bathroom - nothing. I experimentally decided not to clean away a long black hair from a previous guest in the shower cubicle - it is probably still there. One day we left a little later at a 10:30am and came back to not even a made bed (annoying as the linen doesn't fit correctly and comes undone when you sleep - the duvets don't even have a cover - just a sheet top and bottom) When we told reception later we were told it was because we had a DnD sign on. This was removed when we left the room and we even said hello to the housekeeping boy when leaving the room. Basically the housekeeping is bad - never cleaned or hoovered. We were there 6 days before they even changed the bed for fresh linen (which also didn't fit) Toiletries were sparcely replaced too. You can't open the windows due to 'health and safety' whatever that means. I think my main problem is that I was expecting a boutique hotel which the kirketon really isn't. Maybe my own mental definition of boutique hotel is off but I believe it means a small nicely designed and maintained hotel with all the trimmings you would expect. (anyway to prevent a disagreement on this try: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boutique_hotel for a genrally accepted definition. I would especially ask the management team to review this and cross reference it with the kirketon.) Well it is certainly small...and the design is nice but that's it. If that's all your after - then don't worry - enjoy your stay. If you expect more than please - spare yourself the upset when you arrive and book elsewhere. By the way the rude ish receptionist was not seen the rest of our stay and all the other reception staff (all male) were so nice and friendly so I hope none of them get told off. THis is not a staffing issue - it is a management and housekeeping issue. It could so easily be fantastic with the right services; breakfast option, room service option, cleaning better, more toiletries, bathrooms updated, room furniture updated etc etc. but right now it needs addressing to be anywhere near what it appears to be on the website. I feel I could go on but in the interest of putting people off reading the review and also rubbing salt into the wounds I think this will do. Needless to say I won't be booking an 8 hotel again or recommending them until I hear they have improved. The extra rating above Terrible is for the location and the staff.

There is indeed a lot of noise from the restaurant and bar located on the ground floor. The restaurant and bar is very very popular.

Check-in was friendly and efficient and I was informed that I had been granted a double upgrade.The room was indeed on the grand scale with respect to size.

I visited the back bar (the front bar was closed) which was a fantastic find, the bar staff were creating some fantastic looking cocktails and the place had a great energy even on a Wed night, it is definitely a class above your average hotel bar. The other great aspect of the stay was the breakfast which is taken across the road at a cafe which sounds unconventional but is infact a masterstroke as the perfectly cooked breakfast with juice, coffee and freshly baked baguette would probably qualify as the best hotel breakfast I've ever had.

And the hotel even offers to give you a floor lamp if you want one. But in this case, I felt like the dark carpets and tiles are an excuse for not cleaning as much. I can't tell you that the room was unclean, because everything was too dark to tell. But there was no question that the bathroom was not sterile. A quick wipe down would have been the only thing required given the lack of light. Also, the bed was awful. If I were the manager, I would rip out the dark carpets, and replace with dark wood (if dark was needed), would lighten things up a bit, and would do something about the grim bathrooms. I was mercifully upgraded to a bigger front room on the second night. Again, carpets were black and the bathroom was dark. The benefit was that the windows were big and not frosted.

Although I do enjoy this hotel, it may not be for everyone. Three reasons I keep returning: location to train station and restaurants; friendly hotel staff; and Le Petit Creme cafe across the street. This hotel is about a 5-10 minute walk to the train station, many restaurants, pharmacies and a Coles supermarket. Depending on the route taken, the 5-10 walk to the station may take you into the Red Light District. Compared to other chains, I consider the Kirketon a no-frills hotel. The on-site restaurant isn't open all day and room service appears not to be 24 hours. Frills which some may require. The hotel also has no lift, so travel lighlty. When I first stayed here six years ago, I was surprised there was none. Fortunately, the hotel staff assisted to help me carry the luggage up the stairs. On my subsequent stays, I decided to carry the luggage myself. On stays when I had a later flight, I had no problems leaving my luggage with the staff after check-out. I have stayed in both the Standard and Premium rooms which have a small walk-in closet. The closet only has a few shelves with the coffee pot taking up space in one of them. You may end up living out of the suitcase during your stay. I didn't mind as it helped me pack quicker on my final nights. Fortunately, they have made a major safety improvement to the rooms since my prior stay four years ago. At that time, there was a nightstand with metal edges at the same height as the nearby bed. It was very easy to rollover right and hit your head on the metal corner. There is now plenty of space between the bed and nightstand to prevent a similar accident. The bar near the back of the hotel is trendy and popular with the locals. Fortunately, the noise is limited to the reception area, so I never heard any noises in my room. There were a few occasions when I heard people shouting and laughing in the middle of the night in the lobby outside my room. As expected, housecleaning did a good job of cleaning my room each day. Interesting that two of the larger towels were always left on the bed while the rest were hung in the bathroom. Near the end of my stay, I was surprised to find a stack of clean sheets on my chair. I can only assume the person got distracted and forgot they were left there. Since the sheets were not a distraction, I kept forgetting to bring them down to the front desk. During my last stay, I had laundered a long-sleeved t-shirt and travel pants which I wore on the plane. I was surprised that neither came back clean.

On my first day it was 12 degrees, and the bathroom was FREEZING. Of course, the draft came into the rest of the room too. I felt like i had been conned a little - i couldnt really believe such a chic hotel didnt have windows that closed properly. Finally, got into bed (which is tiny) and as i was by myself, got settled in the middle - right on top of a thick, painful seam.

We also had trouble getting a good internet connection from our room. I had to urge the people on Reception many times before they made a concerted effort to sort the problem out (it took 3 days). At one point I was told by someone on reception, \"If it doesn't work, it doesn't work.\" It may seem petty of me to complain about the internet connection, but when this is an advertised feature of the room and when one needs the internet for work purposes, it's fairly essential that the product is delivered. The phone in our room didn't work properly. It made a horrible screeching noise whenever we picked it up. We'd then have to unplug it and plug it back in at least two times before we would hear the dial tone. On a positive note, the room was quite nice, clean and comfortable. It was great to be able to use the well-equipped Fitness First for free. The hotel's location is its best feature. My complaints are small I am aware, but I expected more from such a reputable establishment. In my opinion, the Kirketon needs to step up the game a bit if it wants to retain it's place at the top of the Trip Advisor Sydney hotels list.", "Date": "January 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cThe Kirketon is Sydney's most chic and wonderful of finds!\u201d", "Author": "jlfmusic", "ReviewID": "UR23874283", "Content": "I just returned from the better part of 2/12 weeks of staying at The Kirketon. It's sensational! !! and was a huge part of making my stay in Sydney so alluring. Tipped off by a friend with Aussie roots, it's for those in the know! (I hesitate to even write this to give any secrets away, ha!) Chic, modern, professional and in the heart of one of the absolutely coolest areas of Sydney. Sure, for outsiders wanting to stay at a multidude of choices at the Harbor, that will be reflex choice. Great for some. But, for those wanting to feel that Sydney is home for the time they're there . . . The Kirketon is beyond perfect! Smack in Darlinghurst, with all of the cafes and cool neighborhood spots of Darlinghurst Road and Victoria Street -- from traditional \"hotel\" pubs to the most cutting edge of fusion cuisine and best-rated coffee shops, cafes and restaurants -- you're really in the heart. Moreover . . . every time I stepped back into The Kirketon doors and my room especially . . . I felt comfortable but cool -- hard to combine in a hotel. The decor is amazing. The rooms gorgeous, with earth tones and splashes of burgundy. The shower alone is sell enough!! with rainwater showerhead and ship portal-like spotlight on . . . you! Plus the multi-colored rugs in the foyer and clever playing of silent/B&W films simply cheeky! Add to this the chicest of restaurants and bars adjoining and . . . a young, attractive helpful staff who are there when you need them for counsel/advice but otherwise just warm and friendly . . . this was home!! for the time I was there. Working in the music industry, I've been lucky enough to travel the States and the world (South Africa, Brazil, Thailand, Europe, etc) -- from highbrow to Ian Schraeger cool -- The Kirketon is an absolute favorite on every level. Oh, I'll be back.

We were very pleased with the location, as it seemed to be in the middle of a good, lively location. We arrived quite early by hotel standards, so went in and asked if we could leave our bags. They had no problem with that and told us that our room would be ready by about 1pm, rather than 2pm if we wanted to return then. We had a wander around to get our bearings and had some breakfast. On our return just before 1, we were checked in by the very friendly receptionist and she helped us up to the first floor with our bags. ( there are NO lifts in this hotel). The stairs are carpeted in a different colour every step and not very well lit. Not a problem for us, but for someone with limited vision, I can foresee a potential tripping hazard there. At the top of the stairs on the first floor landing, is a wall mounted plasma tv with black and white movies ( no sound) playing. The reason for which is not obvious to me! The corridor with the double mirrors are quite wacky and fun, for the first 2 mins, but the novelty soon wears off! The corridors are again, like the stairs, dimly lit. On arrival into our room, we were shocked to see how tiny it was. Yet again, very dark, even with the lights on. ( black lampshades dont help) The Bed was comfortable. The window was frosted, but had to be really as it looked onto a covered area for a building that was VERY close to the hotel. Again, this added to the darkness of the room. There was a mirrored headboard in the room, which did what it could to make the room look bigger. There was also a seperate closet, containing the mini bar/dvd player for the tv, and hanging space for clothes.. Oh and the hospitality tray as well, but nowhere to plug the kettle in, so it had to be used in the main room anyway! There were 'pouffe' type seats in the room, but they were tiny and all but useless. The plasma screen tv was wall mounted at the top of the wall opposite the bed. The space between the end of the bed and the wall was RIDICULOUS. There cant have been more than 12 inches, and that is a very generous guess. It was so bad, one had to walk sideways to go past the end of the bed. I have also seen reviews on here saying that the hotel is outdated and management have defended these remarks saying that the hotel was to be fully refurbished and would be completely different and refreshed etc etc It wasnt... We stayed here the week it opened after the refurb.The quality of the finish was terrible. Paint all over the light switches, badly finished paintwork. It looked like it hadnt been sanded down for years and new paing had just been slapped on top of old paint. There was also paint peeling on the window frames ( pics supplied) To summarise... The location is fantastic, near to Kings Cross Tube Station, regular bus services and also the Hop On, Hop Off service. Lots of lovely boutique shops nearby and very reasonably priced and good quality bars and restaurants nearby. The location is the hotels saving grace, because the decor and quality/size of the room is a serious let down.

Away from the mainstream, off the corporate conveyor belt, no loyalty cards or being upsold to spa packages at every opportunity...

In fact, I'd like to apologise to the staff of the Kirketon for being such an inconveniece! Firstly, to the gentleman that checked us in: I so do hope that showing us to our room (\"no, don't worry about taking our bags - we'll lug them up two flights off stairs ourselves\") meant that you didn't miss out on your ebay auction. And I'm truly sorry for being so uninformed to as Sydney geography to even *dare* to ask directions to Oxford street - how silly of me not to bring my TomTom (\"At rude and aloof receptionist, turn right and walk 200 metres...\"). Gosh, you'd think I'd walked into the RSL and ask where the beer was. And to cap it off, check out was less than a breeze, where said receptionist does not acknowledge us in the slightest and instead spent his - albeit *very* valuable time - talking with another staff member regarding which staff drinks he wanted to comp off his tab. After dumping the keys on the front desk, the parting salvo from front desk? \"Hey, what room were you in?\" But you know what? I'm not sorry for this one... that's just woeful service. If only the heart ache stopped there. Granted, the hotel was being closed for refurbishment the day after we were leaving, but really? That's how you keep up with the times? Who uses a VCR these days? Cavemen? No, apparently the Kirketon's hotel's patrons. I loved the special touches as well - the fact that the VCR was *duct taped* (no joke!) to the underside of the circa 1992 television. I must admit, that I did have a giggle at the HiFi system. Here I was looking for a jack for my iPod, when I should have gone into my attic and brushed off my cassette collection. If only I had read the reviews posted on this site prior to booking. The only thing worse than an establishment that does not acknowledge feedback is an establishment that responds to feedback and does nothing about see \"management response\". Oh well, back to the Hilton for me. Cheers, Chris B P.S. I did forget to mention that we did receive good service.

I live in Sydney and had read heaps of press over the years about the ultra trendy vibe going on at the Kirketon. Decided to stay as saw a cheap last minute rate and my husband and I were dining out that evening in a nearby restaurant ( the Victoria Room - fantastic). Check in was fine, slick no fuss but not friendly. Car park is around the back lane in another building - a bit dingy but the area is reknowned for its urban fringe appeal. Car parking is extra $25 overnight but the car wash across the road from the front entrance does it for $15. No lifts or bell desk so have to drag suitcases up dark, narrow staircase with small steps. On entry into room (303) we were a bit let down. It is tired - not ultra mod trendy. It would have been ultra stylish when it was renovated in 1999 but no work has been done since. Protective seal around door was flapping off, stains on carpet, blanket on bed bobbled and worn, tiles need re-grouting, furniture is scratched and chipped. Light in bath was brown with a rust residue. No DVD only a video and an old TV. Weird music playing when we entered and it comes from radio in the cupboard as it took me ages to find it to turn it off!! Only air con and it would not heat up so room quite cool temperature -wise. Yes there are Aveda amenities but only shampoo, conditioner and body wash no moisturiser which I thought a little cheap. Chocolates on arrival are 2 after dinner mint style chocs. Not much insulation so you can clearly hear what is going on in adjoining rooms and in the corridor. Overall fine, clean and convenient if you are doing an evening in Darlinghurst. It is not cutting edge any longer and I would personally rate it alongside a Holiday Inn or 3 star property. We had an executive ing size room and it was a good size. I disagree with previous reviewer as there are a lot of breakfast places nearby - go to the next street - Victoria St for 2 Sydney instituions, Tropicana and Bar Coluzzi also Bills darlinghurst, le petit creme and a host of others are within a1km radius but you most probably have to know where they are - just ask the desk for a recommendation.

However, as the management response to an earlier review says, they are planning to update the hotel and going on this last stay of mine, I'd agree that it's needed. And not just replacing the old vcr with dvd player (come on guys, they cost A$50!). I would dispute their claim that there is no mould in the bathrooms - there certainly was mould on the shower curtain in my room (315) which had curled at the bottom as a result. There were loose, broken and missing tiles on the bathroom floor too. Generally the bathrooms are still one of the best things about the rooms - stylish and practical. However, the flush on the toilet was also faulty - the cistern was empty when first I needed to flush and on removing the lid and tinkering to get the water flowing it never actually filled up, so the water constantly ran, meaning I had to tinker again to get it stop and allow me to sleep! I also failed to get the aircon control to work (\"oh it's a bit difficult you have to point it at a certain angle from the corner of the room\" was the reply at check-out) but that's no use when you're laying bed. The iron also left dirty marks on the sleeve of the shirt I tried to iron, as no-one had dealt with the dirty mark on the hotplate. I was promised a manager would call me about these issues as none was there at check-out... two days later I'm still waiting.

Yes, the photos on the website are sexy. Yes, the reality is different. But at the same time to find a hotel in Sydney for AUD159 or less is pretty amazing. The rooms I had (had to switch because of noise) were a bit smelly (carpets needed cleaning desperately) and the cleaners did a pretty bad job in general (i.e. not washing the bathroom floor, etc...) The staff was excellent- Adrian in particular was very helpful. One annoying-and deceptive- practice of the hotel- beware- is their agreement with Travelex to charge you in your own currency at an inflated exchange rate. Insist on paying in Australian dollars!!!!! The hotel calls it a \"convenience\"...the reality is that your home country will still charge the same foreign currency rate even if it is in your currency...", "Date": "December 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cGreat staff & location\u201d", "Author": "John_at_large", "ReviewID": "UR6366252", "Content": "Stayed in the Kirketon mid November for 3 nights with my wife.

I am writing a review now after seeing the bad review given by another visitor, totally wrong i might add. The hotel was excellent, superb location close to pretty much every where, we walked to everything in Sydney (not always back though) Kings Cross right next door, loads of excellent restaurants and bars a few minues away, and the tube if your feeling tired. The hotel is exeptionally clean, smart and well planned. Yes it is small but we fitted everything in and moved about quite freely in a standard room, the bathroom, well what can you say, wish i had one at home. A point to make is that i travelled 30 hours door to door to see Sydney so was out with my wife a lot, If you go to Sydney to stay in a hotel room then maybe you need to go else where. The staff were really helpful and polite, The only problem we had was late night noise from another room (from the great stereos in each room) it was obviously a party so we left it til very late but then asked staff to sort out. It was sorted in minutes, enough said as far as i am concerned. I will definitly be going back and recommend it to everyone, Ignore ignorant reviewers. By the way the Bar and restaurant weren't finished when we were there so can't wait to see what it's like now, better i assume.", "Date": "September 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Germany", "Title": "\u201cHAD AN AWESOME STAY\u201d", "Author": "enjoyastay", "ReviewID": "UR5612050", "Content": "i HAVE BEEN A COUPLE OF TIMES AT THE KIRKETON AND ALWAYS HAD A GREAT STAY.

Location was really handy. We booked an Executive room, which was lucky, because that wasn't huge. But it was fine. Bathrooms were nice, shower was delicious. We like the stereo being the in the room. Bit dissapointing to open our hotel window and be overlooking cooling vents and airconditioners and nothing else. No lift, so you have to clamber up the stairs but that's okay. No room service, but there is a fantastic place just through the other side of the road called Morgans. Really nice. Mini-bar was super-dooper expensive, even by hotel standards. I would stay there again, but would try to find a cheaper rate than $189 pn for exec room, as that was probably overpriced and we could've got a fancier hotel for just slightly more money if we'd booked on Wotif.

Nothing has changed and therein lies the problem. In a fast moving city such as Sydney then you need to be improving all the time just to keep up and sadly the Kirketon is in need of some overdue TLC. From the scuffed walls to the broken window to the dirty grout in the bathroom tiles it was clear our room had seen better days. Add to this the constant noise from the restaurant refurb, even during the Easter holidays, and I was glad to the weather was so nice and we didn't have to spend much time in the room itself.
