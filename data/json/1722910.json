We booked directly with the hotel because we wanted the red room on their website - when we arrived we were told we had been upgraded - to the bigger red room - they have more than one ! The room itself was huge, probably 20 x 18 feet, with a huge bed - a marble tiled bathroom with the deepest bath we've ever seen, and red everywhere - bedcover, cushions, sofa, wall. There was also aircon, which we even needed in March - and a safe. Everything was spotlessly clean, and the staff wonderfully friendly and helpful and all with very good English - we arrived very early and they took care of our bags while we explored. Breakfast was very good, lots of pastries, bread, cheese, ham, cereals, yoghourt and all very good quality. There was also not only free wifi, but even a laptop connected to use free for those who didnt bring their own. The only niggle was the pillows which were a little firm, but I'm sure if I'd have asked they would have found me soft ones, so helpful and eager to please were the ever smiling staff. The blurb also says that the hotel is a few steps from the Rialto bridge - even with a map it took us a good ten minutes. Not cheap, but where is in Venice, and you could pay a lot more and not get this standard of care, quality and comfort. Almost a bargain.

But when we got in, there was a used towel hanging on the bathroom door. I also didn't like the location. There was a vaporetto stop a few blocks away from the hotel, but if you are staying there for one or a couple of nights, its difficult to get there with your luggage. And its far from the tourist spots. On hindsight, i would have gotten other hotels with their own water taxi service or somewhere near San Marco. Although those hotels are more expensive, the prices are almost comparable. If you think about the fares that you will have to pay for a water taxi or vaporetto everytime you go around, it might turn out to be actually more expensive to stay at this hotel. What also turned me off is how they handled a problem that I encountered with a gondolier. This gondolier accidentally dropped my camera in the water and i lost my camera and all the pictures of my trip (this is subject of another write up). I know this is not in any way the fault of the hotel. In fact, the hotel referred us to one of their accredited gondola companies, but we were not able to go there and ended up taking another gondola service. But i was a really disappointed when i later asked for help from the hotel. Since I didnt get the name of the gondolier at first, they just told me that they cannot do anything about it. Sure they contacted their boss and he gave me advice over the phone to file a police report, but i really felt as if I was on my own. As a first timer in Venice, and coming from a friendly country, I was actually hoping to be taken care of by the hotel. I really hoped to get some extra effort from them to help me at that time or lets face it, just to make us feel better despite what happened. Well maybe thats asking for too much, but its just that I have stayed in hotels in Italy and other countries where i felt the warmth and hospitality of the hosts, and i couldn't help but compare.", "Date": "February 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood Location, Very Nice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Natalie D", "ReviewID": "UR124339934", "Content": "We found the hotel easily after getting off the water taxi, it was very lovely.

It is easily walkable from either but be mindful that if walking from the train you must cross over a large bridge with many stairs.

From station to Hotel you have like 6-7 minutes walk, or you can take Vaporetto, which I find too expensive for such short ride. 5th finding hotel was not so big problem. But it can be much easier while Natural Museum footsteps on streets are drawn in, you should just follow them, as Natural Museum is just across street from Hotel. Hotel: We got map on reception, which was great help when GPS from phone stopped working in small streets, and with map we were never lost. If you have any question reception will jump in to help you. I must admit they were always busy or on the phone. Superior red room was amazing, really was. Bed is comfy and everything was clean. Bathroom was as well, clean and nice. Room had smell of cinnamon, I don't like cinnamon, but smell was amazing, it had relaxation effect on me. Breakfast was nice and simple, I'm vegetarian, but there is not so much things Vegans could eat for breakfast. Overall I'm very pleased with breakfast, was fresh, all that I needed and taste was good. Breakfast room was small, but fit and nice, had that \"romantic\" touch, like eating with family. There is Wi-Fi in room, but it disconnects after short while so I even learned my username and password. Hotel has lift, so it is not problem to get to the rooms. Few downsides for this Superior room: - no carpet between bed and bathroom - plugs for devices are different (more narrow) than other European countries, so I could plug in some but not all devices, solution, ask on reception for extend (in bathroom there is normal plug) - no slippers, it is cold and feels dirty to walk only in socks in room, especially on part from bed till bathroom. Small carpet would solve it. (on reception we were told it is cause of cleaning), but I don't agree, small carpet would solve all. - you can hear if somebody rent room above yours, walking and shaking of luster. Around Hotel: La Zucca restaurant was so close, it is just around the corner, you need reservation day before, but don't worry about it, just ask on reception of hotel to book you in. Store, there is coop store few steps away from Zucca 1 minute from hotel. Museum is like 10 steps away from Hotel.

If you're travelling in by train or bus, the hotel is about 15 minutes walk away from the respective stations in Rialto, just follow the orange signs (which will be visible once you cross the bridge across the canal) for the 'Museo di Storia Naturale di Venezia' and the hotel is next door. When we arrived at the hotel we were informed that we had been upgraded to a Suite as the red room (which I had originally booked) was unavailable. The Suite was even more elegant that the pictures show, it has to be seen to be believed. I spoke to Michelle on the front desk and informed her that I hoped to propose to my girlfriend during the trip and asked if she had any suggestions of where I could do this. Her eyes instantly lit up and suggested the adjoining living room, which would provide the luxury and privacy I was looking for. Michelle was happy to prepare the room for my surprise, which included champagne, rose petals and complimentary bellini's for us both. The surprise couldn't have been better as my partner had no idea what hid behind the door, which was previously locked. During our second day, the staff unlocked the door, and I led my girlfriend into the room and proposed. It was perfect! I can not thank Michelle and the rest of the staff enough for helping to organise my proposal. Thank you again!!! It's a memory that will stay with us both forever! :o) The breakfast was adequate for a hotel of this size and included cereal, pastries and cold cuts. It was enough to keep us going until lunchtime. I believe you can order cooked foods for an extra charge, but this didn't seem necessary as the options available were plentiful. The added bonus of FREE wi-fi helped immensely when trying to plan out our itinerary during our stay. The restaurant recommendations were both wonderful, and I have written separate reviews for them both... The staff at the hotel were all very courteous and nothing was too much effort for them. Even small things such as providing umbrella's for us both during the rain meant a lot. Finally, the only small niggle we found was the small amount of available television channels. There are only a few available (when they work) and only 1 or 2 English channels. This may seem like a minor issue, but when you want to spend a bit of time relaxing in the hotel it can be difficult with nothing to help pass the time.

Also, there is no external lock on the bathroom to guarantee that no one wanders in. You can lock the bathroom once you are inside, but for me, this seems like a security issue.

Sooo beautiful, comfortable bed, real double bed (from my experience of romantic getaways finding an actual double bed and not two singles put together is quite challenging..!), spacious room (I do have to point out though that we payed for a premium room, I don't know what size the standards are), gorgeous modern clean bathroom with a wonderful shower, impecable heating/air con system, the room and bathroom were cleaned everyday, and last but not least, no noise from the other rooms! -breakfast was plentiful, varied, fresh and delicious every morning, even better than at home, and by far the best breakfast I have ever had in a hotel -free wifi which worked great -a very cosy common area -the most pleasant, welcoming and helpful staff ever, really amazing people whom I would all like to thank for making our stay so amazing, if we were to come back to Venice there's absolutely no doubt that we'll go back there. Definitely arrange everything through them, we were too stupid to follow their recommendations with restaurants and ended up having quite a negative experience of the food in Venice, but did ask them to arrange a gondola ride and it was probably the most magical moment of my life (even though most reviews will warn you that it's such a rip off and an anti-climax!) The gondolero was so kind and told us loads of amazing stories about the buildings we were passing by, and the ride ended up being substantialy longer than planned (again, most people will tell you that they rip you off by cutting the time short) - all that to say, the hotel staff WILL make it an amazing holiday for you, they are ever so helpful so definitely make the most of their help. To finish I would just point out that we stayed there for a romantic getaway, and it might be that this hotel is particularly suited for that, which made it all the more magic.

It's a quiet neighborhood, which is great during the day if you hate crowds, but at night, the lack of foot traffic was actually a little unsettling, especially on our first couple nights, before we learned our way around.

We stayed in a superior ivory room and it was immaculate. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom was a bit small, but I suppose that's true of most hotels in Venice. The only \"downside\" to this hotel is that it's a bit of a walk (20-25 mins) to get to and from Rialto and St. Mark's. In many ways, this is actually a good thing because it gets you away from the tourist shops and restaurants and allows you to experience a more authentic area of Venice. However, if you plan to spend most of your time near St. Mark's, the trip back and forth could get a little tiring.", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fredericton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cStaff extremely friendly and helpful!\u201d", "Author": "BevyPoo", "ReviewID": "UR115495641", "Content": "Not only was our room beautiful and spacious.

As soon as we walked in the door we were greeted by a very friendly lady who quickly checked us in and personally escorted us to our room. Our room was the only one that did not have an ensuite bathroom which was not a problem for us - the bathroom was up a short flight of stairs and we were the only people using it. The room itself was huge with a lovely big comfortable bed, high quality linen and comfortable, elegant furniture. Ours had a cream colour scheme though others in the hotel we noticed had extravagent deep red carpets and wall paper. There was a wardrobe and an in-room safe which was a bonus to be able to lock passports away safely. The external bathroom was also very large with a wonderful strong and roomy shower and we appreciated the quality soaps and shampoos. Everything in both rooms was spotlessly clean except we noticed a few stains on the couch which was a shame to spoil such gorgeous furniture. Free wi-fi was very handy too - a password needs to be obtained from reception. Venice can be quite a difficult city to navigate however we were able to find the hotel with minimal difficulty even without a detailed map. It took us about 15 minutes walking from the train station but you can also get a boat if you do not want to (or are unable to) carry your luggage up and down many stairs as you walk across several bridges. We were able to open the windows to our room completely so we could see down into the street below so nice to have a view of Venice. The hotel is close to a school so we could hear children playing but it was otherwise very quiet and relaxing and we slept incredibly well. We felt more like we were in the real Venice rather than with all the other tourists on the Grand Canal which we loved. The breakfast the next morning was enjoyable with a range of breads, pastries, fruit, juice, coffee etc. It was perfect to get us started for another day of travelling especially after such a great sleep! Overall we thought the hotel was definitely value for money compared to other hotels of similar quality in Venice which is an expensive city. The service and quality of the room for the price was better than most other places we have stayed during this particular trip in Europe and others we have taken before.

It is not close from the hotspots for tourists. But being a small city, it took us less than 30 minutes to reach Piazza San Marco. And along the way, there were so many small boutiques which were so unique to Venice, so no time lost. All in all, please book your next stay in Venice with this hotel.", "Date": "November 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBest thing in Venice\u201d", "Author": "BornTooLoose", "ReviewID": "UR86556719", "Content": "We were disappointed in Venice overall and rejoiced that vicissitudes reduced our visit from two days to one--it's smelly, congested, and overpriced, and most of the shops sell Carnival kitsch and other such merchandise.

We had the red room that is on the website home page, it's very 'venetian' and opulent but not to my taste, it did grow on me as the Prosecco flowed though. The staff were largely pleasant, but seemed under pressure a lot of the time. There was a heated exchange going on when we arrived, it did not stop when we tried to check in. Whilst the service was efficient it was a little uncomfortable, but maybe that is British reserve coming in to contact with Italian spirit :) We got given a map when we arrived and were shown their recommendations for dinner. We were also offered a Murano glass 'tour' by water taxi. I felt, but may be wrong, that these trips were stock recommendations and no effort was made to understand our specific requirements.
