In the heart of Italian capital. You don't need a very expensive taxi or bus from Termini; you can find it very easy, just take a map and address ( with address you even don't need the map) and you will be there after 15-20 minutes of walking. The building is in the residential part surrounded by numerous hotels, residential buildings, restaurants and two embassies: Brazilian and Turkish, so I recommend it as a very safe location . The hotel is on the 4th and 5th floor of the resident building so it gives you unique chance to see how does live ordinary Rome family. I really had great single-bed room (107) with small balcony filled with colorful flowers. The balcony views on balcony of Italian happy family with a small kid, and I could hear how they sing to the kid every day. It was so beautiful. So romantic. I didn't see them but I could feel the harmony of their home. I liked to widely open balcony's door in the morning listening their voices. It wasn't noise. Not at all. It was a song of love. Somewhere in my mind they associate me a scenes with Sofia Loren in old Italian movie, but this time I couldn't see Sofia. Nevertheless, it stays the spirit of romantic Rome. Small cafe nearby the hotel is place for the breakfast. You can take cappuccino or coffee with croissant or domestic cake. Enough to start new day. Small and romantic cafe in the street where that still exists some places from 1970's and 1980's such as a cinema for adult There is a small mini-bar and it is allowed guest to bring the own drinks and some foods. Hotel isn't expensive. Not at all ! I paid 245 Euros for period of 5 nights with breakfast + city tax + discount ( if you pay cash). Knowing the horrible hotel price in the Rome, this is really affordable option. I am sure you can find cheaper, but be carefully. Cheap hotel in Rome means mutual WC and bathroom. I talked with people that took a room in such hotel and they had to wait in line to go in WC . Horrible. I had private bathroom. New and clean . It is very important, especially when you arrived in your room, tired after long walking around the Rome. Staff is great. It is great safety in hotel. I left my lap-top in my room while I was touring the Rome and everything was O.K. On the leaving of the room they stored my bags, for free, giving me a paper as an evidence about it. I will back agan to this hotel. I have already recommended it to my international colleagues. It is so good that I reccomend to all of you who will read this.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cConvenient location near Termini and relatively quiet\u201d", "Author": "Foreignforays", "ReviewID": "UR126966545", "Content": "This hotel was booked as a replacement for one that pulled out on us the day before we were leaving for Rome (water works problems apparently which could be code for we have overbooked, had a better offer, or are going on holiday ourselves as it happened in two locations and it seems hard to believe that coincidence) and we were thus very relieved that although we did not have the time to recommence our research, it was a good choice. Located next door to the German Embassy up a quieter side street and only 10 minutes gentle stroll from Termini, it was surprisingly quiet. Located on the 5th floor, it was a large room for Rome and the bathroom was clean and relatively new. There was lift access in a small but adequate lift if your luggage is not huge. At check in we were given tokens to provide each morning to a cafe about 5 minutes walk away in the neighbourhood to have coffee and a pastry for breakfast which was a nice change from eating in the room and a simple start to the day. There is a restaurant two doors down which we went to on one night when we couldn't be bothered going further afield but I found it a bit overpriced for what was served and the meal ended up costing more than the night's accommodation and that was without wine.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201cJust meet expectation\u201d", "Author": "Lau M", "ReviewID": "UR122397306", "Content": "Mixed good and bad: Maybe it was too full.

I have admit to being slightly apprehensive as we arrived in Rome as to what the Katty Hotel would be like not for any other reason than it being more of budget accommodation and I wasnt sure what to expect. However, I had absolutely nothing to worry about or be concerned about whatsoever. The hotel was fantastic, very clean, we were very well looked after by the owner and her family (I think its family run?), we had fresh towels every day, the room was cleaned and tidied every day and was absolutely spotless, it was fully air-conditioned (on remote control), the room we stayed in was absolutely massive - I have stayed in many 5 star hotels that have never had that amount of room and space in one hotel room!! and we had keys so we could come and go as we pleased. Breakfast was included and we were given vouchers to pop along to a small cafe a few minutes walk away for croissant and coffee (options of regular coffee or latte, cappucino etc) and the breakfast was very nice with lovely fresh, sweet croissants stuffed with jam :-) We didnt stay out particularly late, but on the one night we did, it wasnt a problem at all. The Katty Hotel is ideally located near the Termini - about a 10 minute stroll around the corner, and across a square. Its a safe area as a lot of the embassies appear to be around that area so lots of armed guard around outside of the buildings which only added to our feeling already very safe. There are two supermarkets within a two minute walking distance and the Hotel is close to Linea A and B - A going into the Termini and B stopping literally at the corner of the road of where the Hotel Katty is. The hotel also has wi-fi available which was handy when we wanted to check-in for our return flight. I would definitely recommend staying here, and if I do manage to get back to visit Rome again, this is most definitely where I wil be staying ! Thank you Katty Hotel for a wonderful stay :-)", "Date": "June 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Evanston, IL", "Title": "\u201cClean quiet room, rock hard mattress.\u201d", "Author": "u35828", "ReviewID": "UR66923359", "Content": "Pros about this hotel; it's close to the Metro Caestro Pretorio B line stop, as well as a 20 minute walk from the Roma Termini. The rooms are clean, quiet, and have a contemporary decor. It boasts amenities like a mini-fridge, a remote-controlled air conditioner, and a flat screen TV. It's also near decent restaurants along Via Palestro and Via Castelfidardo. Our unit is on the 6th floor (the 5th floor in European parlance), but serviced by a tiny elevator. Now the cons: the mattress was rock hard, and not very comfortable. Opting for the breakfast service is of dubious value, as the nearby bar provides a minimal breakfast, consisting of one fruit-filled croissant, and your choice of tea or coffee. In summary, travelers on a budget who want more than what a hostel offers, might want to put this one on their short list.

No internet was annoying but there are Internet cafes close by. No breakfast was also annoying but there are cafes close by that do great coffee and crossaint. But the sign stating a 10 euro charge is you wash or cook in the room was extra annoying as we were travelling on a budget and lacked the time to find a laundry and wash. The rooms were fine- clean and a reasonably size. The bathroom was compact. The location was a fair walk from most of the city's attractions.

I refused and paid only 3 nights - which was 3 nights too many. She also refused to account for the fact I paid a 10% deposit already and charged us the full amount!!! The AC did not work without the remote control that was only available to borrow from a reception - which was closed at night. So we had to sleep in overheated sauna for two nights when we came too late to borrow it! There was also no breakfast even though we booked bed&breakfastt.
