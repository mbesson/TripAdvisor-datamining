It was obvious this was not a new problem since there were squished mosquitos all over the walls. We were very disappointed in the hotel's attitude - no compensation and no room change.

Bread, spreads, and juices, they even included ham, cheese, and yogurt upon request.  The room was not the greatest, neither was the bathroom, but it was bigger than the hotel I had in Rome. The staff was fabulous. When my scheduled tour arrangements were mixed up they got right on the phone and made other arrangements for me. They were quite nice and helpful.

The most attractive part of this hotel was the free parking and the fact that it was close to the highway so when we drove in we did not have to deal too much with Florence traffic (which one must avoid at all costs!). The parking was also very safe as it was behind a locked gate. However the hotel did have some issues, the first of which was the rude desk man who was niether pleasant nor helpful. The rooms themselves were small, however because we were in Europe we could hardly complain about that. Our bathroom was actually very large. And the shower nice and hot with a real nonhand-held shower head!! (Far and few between in Europe!) The rooms were clean. But they were so very noisy. Besides the noises of other guests and slamming doors, a persistent hammering began at 8 am in the halls. Apparently this was the time that they saw best to start hotel construction. We were oh so pleased. Our friends had a room on the street-side of the building, and said that they felt like cars were actaully driving in their room.
