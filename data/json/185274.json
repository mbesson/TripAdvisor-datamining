This was a great choice when the cost is split across 2 families. 2 couples and 2 teenagers fit perfect in this 'condo' accommodation. As described in many reviews the place is spacious. We loved having a 'dining area' which provided more open space for all of us to sit, for relaxing and for the meals that were easily made in the kitchen. 1 large King bed room with ensuite, decent Queen bed room, pullout sofa couch and main bathroom, kitchen, living, dining plus a small covered in patio area. The 7th floor worked out great although I did try to get higher (was told the available rooms weren't in good repair at the time). The place was very clean and tidy, not luxurious but certainly not dowdy. The breakfast was a very basic continental - cereal/breads/danishes/banana or apple, coffee and juice but if you team that up with some groceries in your kitchen you can start your day off right. I think they should add some protein - yogurts and boiled eggs, cheese strings. No pool, being renovated but if we wanted to walk to another hotel....? We didn't. The underground parking did look a bit dodgy LOL You drive around the back, turn right, where its a bit rough and there was a lot of construction which when workers were there the gate wasn't always closed. We didn't experience any problems, it just looked a little unsavoury around there. We visited Capilano Suspension bridge which although we choked at the $30 entrance fee, thoroughly enjoyed. There are nice boardwalk trails, a treetop suspension walk and the bridge itself. We had great fun taking pictures and hanging out as a family. Even the teenagers weren't bored. However, Grouse Moutain was a big disappointment. $40 each to go up the cable car!! There were a few actiities if you weren't skiing but very busy and not well organized (sleigh ride). We could only afford to send 2 of our group up there and thank goodness only 2 because it was so foggy and overcast they couldn't get any photo's. For non-payers who stay at the bottom, you can sit at Starbucks and also view the 3 wolves they have protected onsite. We caught feeding time and the staff gave us some history on these 3 'movie' stars who are now enjoying their retirement.

I believe the same in the women's room too. We didn't use them, so can't comment further. There was one bathroom with shower and bath and toilet together. 2 sinks. Free WiFi, which worked very speedily I must say for a hotel. There's free breakfast every morning - your typical continental stuff with some fruits and baked goods. We didn't bother going to the 2nd floor cafe for it, and heard it was normal. Be warned that this is quite far from Stanley Park, which is a beautiful place to spend a day with the family. Good news is that Landis provides a free shuttle to anywhere downtown, including Stanley Park, but you'll need to find your way back. Buses in Vancouver are CAD$2.50 for 90mins. You'll need to take 2 buses back to Hornby, where Landis is. The driver who drove us to Stanley Park was extremely professional and courteous.

One of the blinds in our dining area also had a broken string, but we didn't bother reporting that one, since we wanted to keep the blinds down anyway. 2) The bathroom was sufficient for my family of 5, but there were times I wished there was another toilet (not full bath facilities) available. 3) Extend free shuttle service to Granville island, which is very difficult to get to on foot, even though it is so near. Taxi ride would be about CAD$9 each way.

Once entering our room, it had an odd odour to it. I would describe it as dampness and mildew. The bathroom was not clean and the towels did not smell great and were very old. When using the shower for the first time, it was completely clogged, which caused the bath to fill with water rather quickly. I then saw black particles floating in the water. I rather not know what it was. Don't bother asking for towels. Just go down to the front desk and get them yourself. If you ask, you'll wait and wait...and wait...and wait...and never get them. They only have one person at the front desk most of the time, therefore nobody is available to assist you with anything. We also called the front desk to ask for some suggestions on restaurants around the neighbourhood. The lady did not know. How do you not know? Whether you live in the area or not, know at least one restaurant in which you can recommend to your customers. She guided us to some black binder which was completely useless. On our last day, front desk did call a cab to pick us up--but of course it was a friend of the person who called.

I called the number on the ad and he was very rude and was not willing to answer my questions and sounded annoyed). Not that I have a problem with giving your friend some business, but that was the only time this man at the front desk was willing to do something. So, we were glad to be leaving this hotel, we sign the bill and all of that and rather than saying thank you, the man at the front desk proceeded to pick up the phone and talk to someone who sounded like a friend.

After scouring the internet for what I thought would be the best place I decided to book a room here. We ended up paying over $1700 for our stay here, so I'd say that's a pretty significant amount of money. The first 3 days of our stay we were woken up by street construction from a jackhammer at 8 am on Davie Street. This was pretty terrible and resulted in some bad sleep from both of us. Nothing could have been more irritating than the construction from about 8 am to to 10 am every day. We had to sleep with earplugs to not have a heart attack waking up in the morning. What I liked about the hotel: The maids are super friendly and helpful, they tried to come in and clean every day even though we did not need it They change your towels and bed sheets every day, I would ask next time to not worry so much about this since it's wasteful They have a pool, hot tub and gym There's a good amount of space in the suite All the appliances you need in the kitchen King sized bed Japanese tea pot, that was neat and we actually used it and bought some loose tea What was missing that could have made our stay better: Kitchen supplies: cutting board, knives, frying pan, colander, blender not provided Only 1 washing machine for the whole hotel, the one in the ladies change room by the pool was out of service the entire stay, that is ridiculous The breakfast was not really health food friendly, we're vegan so we did not eat it, we would have liked some good fruit to be offered instead of cereal and milk and crappy muffins The pillows were basic small ones, I was really hoping to have some plush king sized soft pillows The internet is REALLY slow, you can't even watch youtube, let alone download or upload something. We work from home on our internet business and this basically meant we were inefficient for 8 days working online. I expect much better from an Executive hotel. The light switch situation is a little out of control there are I think 11 or 12 light switches in the whole suite, all out side of the rooms and some of them work and some of them don't, so you have no idea what light switch is for what. PLEASE LABEL THEM or remove ones that do not work. Light switches for bedrooms are a necessity. The tv did not work for us, it said signal scrambled. So we didn't bother. We tried plugging our laptops into the outlets in the living room and some of the outlets did not work. Only 1 out of a set of two worked for some reason, so that was frustrating. Only one of the windows opened in our dining room, the other one the handle was broken off, so it was hard to get some air in the room. The living room is completely sealed off. So we had 1 window in each bedroom that could open and 1 in the glass dining room. I told the front desk after a few days that we would have liked some extra kitchen amenities and pillows. Pillows and a colander showed up the next morning. That afternoon we received some larger eating bowls. The ones provided are toddler sized and pretty useless. And then 3 days before we left we received a frying pan outside of our door, so we cooked a stir fry that night. It was nice to get them, but any kitchen should be equipped with these things. It would have been nice to be able to make a smoothie in the morning with a blender. Almost every suite we book has a blender for morning smoothies. I really hope the hotel can provide some extra amenities. Because for the price we paid we feel like we could have had more if we stayed somewhere else. This is Vancouver, but we could have booked a resort somewhere for cheaper. We thought about moving hotels half way but we had already bought groceries and settled in and it would have been too much hassle to pack it up and get a cab out.

The room I had was much more a two bedroom condo, than a hotel room. There were two full baths, a complete kitchen (full size appliances!), living and dining areas, and two bedrooms. One bedroom had a king bed, huge closet and good sized dresser. The other had a queen bed, big closet and dresser. Both had TVs, a view, and partially opening windows. The living and dining areas had opening windows, a table with seats for four, sofa, coffee table and TV, as well as a small coat closet. There was also a small solarium off the living area with a window that opened far enough to make it more of a balcony. Having two full baths was very handy; we always had plenty of towels and there was never any congestion when getting ready to go out. There is a free breakfast in the morning, though the hours could be a bit longer. It has a good selection of muffins, breads, fruit, bagels, juices and coffee. I didn't try out the pool or the fitness facility, but they seemed to be adequate. There are washers and dryers located in the fitness area change rooms. Parking is reasonable for a city hotel, and is secured by a card lock gate. Wireless internet access is free. There is a morning paper Monday to Saturday. We had a couple of small maintenance issues, which were handled promptly by the hotel staff. The location is great; easy walking distance to many different tourist destinations and the hotel has a free shuttle. There are plenty of restaurants and bar in the area, as well as shops to stock up on your own food and drink.

My main reasons for staying there were the favourable reviews and the relatively low price for a 2 room suite in downtown Vancouver. My experience with the hotel was unfortunately mixed. Location wise, I have no complaints although there is not very much in the immediate vicinity except for a 7-Eleven outlet, and a nice but perhaps secluded and underrated Chinese restaurant. Service wise, things could have been improved. At the time of booking, I specifically stated that I wanted two double beds in the 2nd room, and not a queen bed. I categorically told them that they should not accept my booking if they could not guarantee this. They accepted my booking. So I was very disappointed to discover on checking in that I was not given what I wanted. I may sound like I am splitting hairs, but the makeup of my travelling party necessitates two double beds in the 2nd room rather than a Queen bed. They gave what I consider a lame excuse (the room reserved for me had a leak two days ago which wet the carpets, and the carpets now had a damp odour). Although I was given the room I wanted on the next day, it was an unnecessary inconvenience for me to pack and unpack for the room transfer. The staff gave the impression that they were doing me a favour by entertaining my request for a room transfer, but they ought in fact to have been highly apologetic about spoiling my stay for the first night. Breakfast, though complimentary. was spartan. In fact, this was the worst breakfast spread of any hotel that I have ever stayed in. Do not go to this hotel if a hearty breakfast is important to you!! Furniture and fittings in the room looked like they are due for an upgrade. Housekeeping was quite average, Although they did vacumn the carpets, they missed several obvious areas that ought to be cleaned. Housekepping items and trash bags were left along the hotel's narrow corridors, and this gave a cheap feel to the hotel. I would probably not stay at the Landis again.", "Date": "July 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fairfield, California", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Landis\u201d", "Author": "Eeyoreblues", "ReviewID": "UR18144578", "Content": "We recently stayed at the Landis for 2 days before we took off on our Fourth of July Cruise.

The kitchen was very well stock full of appliances, the coffeemaker and toaster were a plus along with needed dishes to enjoy the compliamentary breakfast that was served downstairs that I brought upstairs for my family. The price was wonderful for this suite, we would have spent twice as much money getting the same conviences booking 2 rooms at another hotel. Hotel staff were very welcoming and provided information on the area and local eateries within walking distant. Leaving a note for room attendents in the morning provided for extra towels and coffee fixings without any problems and rooms were made up daily very nicely. A benefit of this hotel is the free shuttle service that is available to take you anywhere in the downtown area. We were able to arrange call times for the shuttle in the morning and they were ready to go at our scheduled time. This saved on money for cabs to take us to Stanley Park one day and then to our Cruise departure pier another day. The drivers are real friendly and give you an overview of the area and it's history (not to mention discount tickets to attractions).
