We went to this hotel in January to take our four dogs to the beach. When we called to make a reservation, the lady on the phone was very pleasant. When we arrived, she was even nicer and very accommodating to both us and the dogs. She said we could give notice at any time if we wanted to stay another day and let us check in very, very early. (We did stay another day) It must be said that I rated five stars for the DOGS. Where else can you go that they happily accept four large dogs? This place was perfect: tile floors, the rooms have a community back yard with screen and glass doors to the patio, literally on Dog Beach, the rooms are simple so there's no worrying about the dogs ruining something in all their frenzy, and the dog wash station they provide is awesome! Shampoo, towels, hoses. Don't come here expecting anything fancy. Bare simple basic for the humans- it really seems like a dog hotel first. But when you get to go to the beach with all your dogs instead of leaving them with a babysitter, it's totally worth the cheesy bedding and squeaky mattress. (Besides, who'd want to put nice bedding out if you know dogs were gonna be all over it?) The dogs had a fantastic time and we have already made another reservation for March.

San Deigo was awesome and I'm looking forward to going back for another visit. This place is actually in Ocean Beach, which we loved! It is very close to the beach as others have mentioned, literally a 2 min walk and you are there. The dog beach was nice and it was great to see all the dogs playing. The motel was OK. We stayed for two nights. I had read some of the reviews on here and it is a good place to go with your dog. They are set up very well for them, the floors are tile, they have a dog wash so you can want the sand off, and the dog run by the rooms is nice. The swimming pool at the hotel looked fine (we didn't use it - there's an ocean to play in!). We didn't have any issues with getting breakfast after 9a, there was still plenty and they were restocking. It is your basic cont breakfast: yogurt, breads, oatmeal, cold cereal, hard boiled eggs, juice, milk, and coffee. The staff seemed friendly and they were prompt in cleaning our room. We had to let them know when we would be out with the dog and they cleaned it then. They do have wifi. The room itself was basic: two beds, tv w/ cable, micro, and refrig. The bathroom was huge. The toilet and shower were in their own room with a door which made it easier to get ready for the day. My main issue was with the beds. The mattresses were litteraly 3 inches thick. There were springs poking through every inch of them. Since the mattress was so thin, it meant you're basically sleeping on the box springs with matress springs poking you. I woke up with my hips and shoulders hurting from laying on my side. I was thankful it was only two nights on those beds. I'm not sure I would last a whole week there. The shower was just a shower, no tub (which is fine by me, I'd never take a bath in a motel anyway). The shower enclosure was older and it showed. We did encounter a rather large bug. There was space under the door, so it could have came in there, but it was in the shower. I was not a happy camper. My friend got rid of it and thankfully we only saw the one. I realize that you are paying for location and the convenience of being able to take your dog with you at this motel, but $178 is pretty steep for it and that doesn't include the nightly pet fee. I'd never stay here without a dog. There are much better hotels, close to the beach, for about the same $ that are way nicer if you don't have a dog. There are other hotels that accept dogs that are nicer, but are not nearly as close to dog beach as this one. I'd be ify on staying here again. It would have to be for no more than two nights. I couldn't sleep on those beds, for that price, for any longer. I would certainly do some more research to see what other places were close that accepted dogs before just booking here again.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cnice hotel for average family\u201d", "Author": "jwe77", "ReviewID": "UR115672274", "Content": "The hotel is within walking distance to the beach, very close.

If you don\u2019t have a pet in tow, it is merely an overpriced, rundown beachside motel. If you brought pups along, it\u2019s an awesome experience. We brought our two dogs and stayed in the downstairs, dog-friendly rooms. The Bad: ancient, creaky spring mattresses, ants (albeit harmless, tiny ones), noise from upstairs, no sign of maid services (we stayed two nights), limited nearby dining options (it is in an aging residential neighborhood), occasional homeless bum sighting. Absurdly dim room lighting. San Diego\u2019s beaches are generally surprisingly cloudy and cold unless you visit during late summer or early fall. The Good: decent fare at the free continental breakfast. The closest dining option is excellent: the Surf Rider Pizza Caf\u00e9 (http://www.surfriderpizzacafe.com/) served outstanding, huge veggie Stromboli. The TV set offered about 60 channels. Their free wi-fi was painless. The heater/AC unit drowns out all noise, enabling a decent night\u2019s sleep. The Dog: Instant entertainment/chaos provided by opening your sliding-glass door, which puts you in the common, fenced-in dog run. Neighboring pups are free to visit, and will, whether you want them or not. For whatever reason, dogs almost always get along when no leashes are involved, and ours did fine. Very short walk to neighboring Dog Beach, which allows dogs to be unleashed and frolic in the surf. The water is shallow and the beach is bordered by a tidal basin. There were about twenty dogs there every time we visited, mostly retrievers frantically diving in after thrown balls.

Staff was really very friendly. We arrived 4 hours earlier than check-in, and they had us in our room withing one hour, thank you staff. Great spot for people wanting to travel with your animals. The rooms and accommodations are geared for the animal lover not a spa or special amenity type stay. We slept well but the airport is nearby, so if you ar a light sleeper, bring earplugs. The beds are not comfortable and I believe are old school...springs. The staff do not disturb the rooms with animals in them unless requested to do so, and this is just perfect. Morning breakfast is muffins, waffles ,juice etc and is fine to get you moving. Rooms are again, not 3, 4 or 5 star but provide for the basics, hot water, microwave, HBO, wifi, is secure etc.... Great value for a pet traveler or a budget traveler. No evidence of a soiled or smelly room, no critters crawling around and very quiet at night. Was able to see the nightly fireworks display at Sea World from our room. Was able to let the dogs roam the large beach, unharnessed ( right behind the hotel, yeah!!) and met a lot of other playful pooches and their owners. After their morning run, we were able to wander around La Jolla, tour Midway, go to Balboa Park, Seaport Village and take in the surf next to the Pier. As this location was in a great location, we could run our dogs along the park and the beach several times a day. They pretty much slept all the way back to Arizona, again, yeah. Rented bikes and ate at a few fun places as well along the way. Great little spot to forget about work. The community supports the animal traveler and as a whole are very friendly.

Tile floors (that never did feel really clean, so we wore our socks. And there is a broom/dust pan in your room), older furnishings/linens. All clean. A separate vanity area has a mini frig and microwave. The shower was old and we had plumbing issues (back up in the shower and sink). Staff was able to move us into another room when they found out the plumber wouldn't be in til the afternoon. One of the best features is the dog run which each lower room opens up to. There is a porch with a table, chairs and a bench. But keep the screen closed if you don't want dogs wandering into your room! And don't forget to clean up after your pooch! Dog Beach is a short walk from the motel, along a nice bike/walking path. The area around the motel is rather run down, this isn't Malibu! Smells like you'd expect a dog beach to smell like (wet dog with some (ahem) urine mixed in), and watch where you walk!! Dog clean up bags are provided at the motel and along the beach, please use them! If sunbathing and relaxing is what you're looking for in a beach, this isn't the spot for you. Dogs are free to be off leash and love it. Watching them play was enjoyable. There is another beach just over the walkway from Dog Beach, if you'd like to be with only people. There is a dog hosing off area at the end of the building (past room 29). Just a hose and they'll give you a towel. The pool was very nice, not really warm, but good enough and well taken care of. The grounds were nice with all the cactus and plants. The staff was wonderful - all of them (I forgot their names...Lydia? Cassandra?). Very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was fine to start the day off, nothing fancy, but the waffles were good and the breakfast room was nice.

Close and with in walking distance to Ocean Beach boardwalk/attractions, restaurants, etc. Cons - The place is run down, in need of a MAJOR refurbishment and everything is very out dated!! This is by no means a hotel, it's a motel at best. The rooms are small, the beds feel like you're sleeping on springs (probably the worst nights sleep I've ever had), the linen had holes in some of them, i.e. holes in bedspread and blanket, the unit we were in only had a shower stall and no bathtub, the grout in the tile floors either need a massive cleaning or new grout because it's very dirty. The woodwork on the walls is knicked all through out, the ceiling fan in the room we were in only worked if the bathroom light was on which made me think there was some faulty electrical wiring in the place. We did have our dogs with us and the place allows dogs. Those traveling with dogs are put in the first level units and all the first level unit patio doors open to a large enclosed area in the back so everyone's dogs are out there together which is fine. The problem being is that if you don't close your door you will have other people's dogs wandering through your room, which happened to be the case with us. What's worst is that someone else's dog went #2 on one of our beds and another dog (or maybe it was the same one, who knows) lifted it's leg and peed on the other bed. That's when I said we were out of there. It was bad enough they were charging almost $200 a night (including tax and pet fee) when the place isn't even worth even what a Motel 6 charges a night!! We had booked for 5 nights and checked out after 1. There is an outdoor heated pool that looked like it was kept up, although we didn't use it.

The floor was filthy, the bathroom smelled like urine, the lampshade was falling off, there was a 1x1 wooden stick in the slider (extra security??) and when we went out to the patio, there was dog poop on the lawn, which is shared with other rooms (and their dogs). Walked over to the beach as there were lots of dogs playing - that was fun but the beach is really only for dogs. It's dirty. Continental breakfast is a joke. There is bread, cereal and milk. This motel looks a lot better in pictures than it really is. There are much nicer pet-friendly hotels in the San Diego area.", "Date": "November 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cAwesome!!!\u201d", "Author": "jenericmail", "ReviewID": "UR21387947", "Content": "My husband and I booked a room at the Ocean Villa this last weekend to celebrate our 13th Anniversary.

We did not have dogs with us and although I had read great reviews from people who had dogs, I was concerned about how we would enjoy our stay without them. Well, we were pleasantly surprised. I am rating this above average for the location. The location is really the best. For those with dogs, it's right next to dog beach. For those without, the \"people\" beach is just across a parking lot from the inn. It's separated from dog beach by a jetty of rocks and you don't even see the dogs unless you walk over a hill and watch them having a great time on their own beach. It was really fun to watch so many different kinds of dogs having such great fun! Also, although there were many dogs staying at the motel, we never heard them at night at all so that was not a problem. The motel is in a residential area and within walking distance to some restaurants and a super quick drive to many others. I would really rate the actual motel as average, but adequate. The outside of the motel is not fancy at all, and the rooms are a little dated, but clean and well maintained. We had a deluxe room with a full fridge, small sink and microwave. It had two queen beds and although one of them was rather noisy, they were comfortable. There was also a couch that made into a bed. One thing though, there was supposed to be HBO and Showtime but we were never able to find them! There is a continental breakfast served, but it is really pretty average at best and we decided to get breakfast elsewhere. Overall, because of the location on the beach, and because it is clean and comfortable, I will definitely be staying here again.", "Date": "October 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palm Springs, CA", "Title": "\u201cPerfect vacation for you and your dog! :)\u201d", "Author": "swainscott", "ReviewID": "UR20809176", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here with our dog for our 5 year anniversary and we had the best time!

The staff was extremely friendly and very helpful. Check in was smooth, no problems, enusre you let them know your are a AAA member! Front office has coffee and tea along with dog treats to welcome your dog! Our room was ok, tile floor, two beds standard. What I liked was the dog run attached to the rooms for potty breaks, even though we kept ours tied up, it was great to meet neighboors and their other friendly dogs and to realize we are not the only family in the world who loves traveling with their dogs! TIP, remember this hotel is booked up espically in the rooms just for dogs so we did not expect a 5 diamond resort. If you take the \"white glove\" treatment and put on your glasses and inspect of course you will find some areas that need improvements and the same can be said for the home you live in. I liked the newer microwave and refrigerator in our room. We really enjoyed the heated pool and the ability to have our dogs sit around the pool, dogs not allowed in the pool of course. We enjoyed the comp cont. breakfast and the location of this property is perfect for any person with a dog who likes to relax on vacation with their dog. The dog beach is only a two minute walk from the hotel, beach is clean and very spread out, plenty of room for your dogs to run. Their is even a off leash dog park within a 5 minute drive from the hotel which we went to often. Also we used the Sea World Pet Facility and placed out two dogs in for only $5.00/day! Make sure you bring a water bowl as water is provided but not a bowl! Overall if you are looking for a GREAT experience to visit Sea World and do any beach activities this is the place to stay!

Though the Villa advertises itself as being dog friendly, and many people brought dogs, we didn't and weren't bothered at all by dogs. Our second floor room was very spacious, large balcony overlooking the Mission Bay Channel of the San Diego River, and the ocean. It was a non smoking non pet room. We had a microwave and a fridge in the room. There is always coffee, fresh fruit and microwave popcorn in the lobby. The staff was really great. Kelly and Whitney have picked their favorite places, including the all day happy hour $2.50 well drinks at an odd place called Pacific Shores, about four blocks away. Be sure to walk 3/4 of the way out to the resturaunt on the Ocean Beach concrete pier for great lobster tacos, and among the best fries we've ever had. The pool is very nice. There was a feeling of laid back comfort about the whole place. Each morning there's a continental breakfast of fresh fruit, muffins, hard boiled eggs and cereal. We found them on the web, studied their website, and called to make the reservation. The only drawback is that it's under the flight path, so sometimes the planes are pretty loud, but the San Diego airport is right in the middle of town, so you hear them most places.

The heated pool was nice, since it was fairly cool during our trip and the ocean was definitely not warm enough for our liking. Their policy of checking in with the desk before we left our dogs in the room alone was completely reasonable and actually reassuring to know if there was a problem someone would call us. I would highly recommend this hotel to people with four-legged children who are well-socialized.

Lots of friendly people, awesome co-op for groceries, and dogs are welcome almost everywhere. However, location is the only thing it has going for it...it's pretty run down and in need of some major upgrades - really overpriced for the quality of the rooms. We were woken every morning by the stomping of the upstairs guests getting ready for their day - it appears the insulation is really bad between upstairs floor and downstairs ceiling, and dogs are not allowed in upstairs rooms (I always prefer top floor because of noise issues), which of course are the rooms with the water & sunset views. The bottom of the bathroom door was water damaged, the entryway light didn't work and the bathroom lights flicker on (sort of Bates Motel-ish). But like I said, this place has location and the staff is super friendly. Because of that, I will definitely return. I strongly recommend bringing slippers - the floors are tile.

It is fabulous...close to the water and 15 minutes or so from almost everything else. It is a small Inn and therfore quiet. Parking is close and ample. We stayed in room 31 which is our favorite. Unfortunately on this trip the heater was not working, the toilet backed up and one of the box springs squeaked every time you moved. The staff was very helpful in providing us with extra blankets and a plunger. Maintenance came the next day and flipped the mattress which helped a little, but not much. He was not able to fix the heater so we were provided with a portable radiator which took care of the chilly night temperatures. One trial with the plunger and that was taken care of as well. We had a very loud party going on next door on New Years Eve. Once again the staff was attentive and dealt with the situation quickly and appropriately. It took sveral contacts from the staff but the excessive noise finally did stop. We stay at the Ocean Villa Inn because it is normally very quiet and located close to the water. We have also been pleased with the staff handling issues should they arise. We have enjoyed 10 years of vacationing at Ocean Beach and hope to enjoy staying at Ocean VIlla Inn for at least another 10. Despite the issues we had a very restful and relaxing stay. We will be returning the first weekend in April and hope that the box spring on the bed by the balcony has been replaced and the heater has been fixed by then.
