AMAZING, AMAZING, and WOW AMAZING! I must say people need to book the correct rate and communicate your needs to the staff. My husband and I are VERY picky travelers. First off, the food is perfect. my husband has diverticulitus and cant do spicy. I simpley called the hotel, spoke to the chef and he remembered the ENTIRE week about the special food issue we have. let me also break down what I found to be incorrect on tripadvisor. #1- ipods are free to borrow during your stay (not $500 as some one else mentioned) #2-prices are very resonable. $18 penna pasta, $12 main meal bowl of soup and bread, $22 french toast w/ all the sides and coffee included. I mean really, where can you go and get specially made food to your liking for great american prices. If you dont like it, tell them. they will make it right. #3 quite rooms, that are spotless.- get a plunge pool and enjoy (they arent cold, you just ask 30,min prior to use and they will warm it tright up to the requested temp of your choice) NO BUGS, they light a diffrent scented oil each nite and place near windows in your room. also on the deck the light a bug coil everynight to keep bugs away outside. you dont need to leave your bed to adjust the window blinds, tv volume, fan, ac, heat or even dimmer lights...there is a switch for it all on EACH side of the bed for him/her. #4 known by first name - everyone and i mean everyone will call you by your name. i feel bad because i couldnt remeber everyones name myself. and service is like NO WHERE ELSE. #5- they do all the extras. all the little details, they do! If you want something for gosh sakes, speak up! they will make it perfect in everyway. I smashed my hand while there and i felt like a queen. they were so caring and generally worried about my piece of mind and health. #6 beach is the best, and they wont let yo move a finger. infact everyone from the farther hotels down the beach kept trying to steal our plush towls from the basket they provide for the guest by the outside shower. 5 people were kindly asked to move off the private beach cabanas for esencia guests only, made me laugh. #7 splurge on the house - they will give you an equal credit for the value of your room each and every day you are there, meaning my room was $699 per night and EVRY day they gave us $699 to use on food, alcohol, spa service, taxi service, etc! over the whole week tax/service tips totalled $500 for two people for days. SO CHEAP for all that they do and make you feel. learn to book the correct rate for your needs and communicate with the hotel...you wont be dissappointed, promise! tell lulu, marisol, jamie, brenda, louise, the chef and everyone else The Guffey's recommended ya!", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angeles, ca", "Title": "\u201cLuxury in Every Way\u201d", "Author": "tamiam1969", "ReviewID": "UR125855134", "Content": "We usually stay at a hotel in Tulum and decided this time to spend the first week at Be Tulum and the second week at Esencia (they had an amazing deal called the \"Splurge\" which made it a very reasonable price for the luxurious stay - the \"service charges\" were unavoidable and quite pricy). The staff are very friendly and attentive, the spa is unlike others I have been too (in a good way), the food was diverse and reliably good, the beach was amazing, the room was spacious with all modern amenities (we even had 2 bathrooms), the pools were fresh water (one is for kids), and all requests were accomodated. We originally booked a garden/jungle plunge pool room, but after being on the beach in Tulum, I had to hear and see the ocean from our room so we upgraded and could not have been happier. The bed was comfortable, which made my husband very happy! Our room had a nice big patio with table and chairs, a day bed and a hammock, plus a georgous view of the ocean. We will be on the look out for specials again, which you can see on their website or by just calling, because we would love to go back if the price/special offer is right, so to speak. Now, a bit of information about the beach area. Esencia is not exactly in Playa del Carmen, it is south of there and located in a cove. It takes about 25 to 30 minutes to walk from one end to the other and there are a few other hotels that are operating there. You should know that there are also a few hotels/developments that are vacant and in disrepair - most are guarded so as to prevent squatters. Because the cove is small, the vacant developments do not really affect the feel of the beach. It is still quite pristine. There is one all inclusive development in the cove, but folks there stay to themselves so the beach at Esencia remains pretty private. The ocean itself is mostly shallow, quite rocky in places and reefy in others, which made swiming out a bit tricky, but take a buddy and you can manuver fine. We swam every day and had a blast.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochester, New York", "Title": "\u201cOne of the best\u201d", "Author": "Tim_Ingersoll", "ReviewID": "UR125193316", "Content": "I have been to the Yucatan area of Mexico approximately fifteen times.

If you are looking for an intimate setting for romance or a great place to bring the kids this place has the space to accomodate either and yet it feels like an intimate resort. There are mini-villas with their own pools that you can rent for a family. There are also extremely private rooms for two with their own plunge pools. We were ten minutes by cab to Puerto Adventuras for diving and other water activities or the concierge would be happy to set everything up for you. That's what really blew me away about this place. The staff is unlike anything I've experienced in my life. They were genuinely interested in whether or not we had a good time.

From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave you are treated like you are in a friend\u2019s home. It is not just a marketing slogan on the hotels part it is part of the mindset. From not seeing a bill for 10 ten days to always being address by first name it is the perfect way to spend some quiet time. Some observations for people considering visiting Esencia for the first time though: * The resort is not designed for Children over the age of 4 or 5. Meaning there are no organized activities, the pools are not meant to be used for ball playing or doing cannonballs into. Therefore, please keep in mind that if you are bringing children to the resort that most of the other guests selected this resort to have complete relaxation and not be disturbed. If you are planning on visiting during an American School break be prepared for this type of behavior as they hotel went overnight from a private oasis to a hotel that had a population of 25% children.. * While the service at the spa is great you will notice an inconsistency in the same treatment if provided by different people during your stay. One time you get a feature in a treatment and then next time a different worker does not included the same feature. * All rooms are great but if you enjoy sitting outside at your room do not spend the extra money for Ocean view/Ocean Suite as those terraces are smaller and do not affoard the privacy of the Garden Suites. * As the resort only has 29 rooms their is only one dinning option for Breakfast/ Lunch and One option for dinner. Therefore, if yo like a lot of variety this resort might not work for you as Playa Del Carmen is a 20-minute ride via cab and costs I believe $25. HOWEVER, an advantage of the small size of the resort is Chef Bernardo and his team will make you any variation of a dish using what they have in the kitchen. His seafood Paella and Tuna Fillet are amazing items that are not on the menu. * Now to the Staff of the property they are they true winners of the resort. From Lillianna in reception/ congierge to Oswaldo on the beach and the entire waiter team (espcially Fidel, Louis, Juan, and Clemintino). They are all very hardworking individuals who deserve the reconiztion as they remember your personal preferences and will converse with you anytime you want or work in stealth mode at other times. With all of these observations, I look forward to my next trip back and cannot wait to see all our friends again.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, Alabama", "Title": "\u201cAn Esencia Wedding and Honeymoon\u201d", "Author": "Evelyn W", "ReviewID": "UR124663213", "Content": "I had my wedding and honeymoon at Esencia last July and could not have imagined how perfect and wonderful it was. I will start my review with my wedding planning process by saying \u201cEvery bride needs a Brenda\u201d. Brenda Espinosa is the wedding coordinator at Esencia, and she is absolutely incredible. She takes care of every detail, no matter how small, with such diligence and care you would think she was planning her own wedding. She had a lot on her plate, dealing with a three night wedding event for me and my 75 guests, but she did it all with a smile on her face. Brenda always ends her conversations with \u201cNo Worries!\u201d, and with her help planning, there definitely were not any. \u201cNo worries\u201d is a great lead in to my experience at Esencia for my wedding. It was truly a dream come true. Between the casual luxury of each event (welcome cocktail party, rehearsal dinner, wedding & reception), and the exceptional staff, me and my guests were actually able to relax and enjoy each other. I never had to worry about a thing\u2026seriously. How many brides can say that? I cannot think of words to do the staff justice on their exceptional job for my wedding weekend. All I can do is say THANK YOU for making it truly the best three days of my life. Now for the review of our stay at Esencia; it was truly an escape to paradise. Here are a few examples of how Esencia goes above and beyond for their guests: they present you with a bottle of wine from their vineyard when you check in (and it is delicious!), every morning you wake up to coffe/tea/danish on your patio to enjoy, breakfast is included in your stay and it is NOT to be missed as it is amazing, tea and cookies are served in the main house in the late afternoon, and complimentary yoga takes place in the morning. The staff at Esencia is second to none. They know you by name, not room number, and they become your friends while you are there (yet they know exactly when you need to be left alone to relax!). Omar and Fidel, Lane and I still talk about how much we enjoyed you on our stay! The restaurants are incredible; I must reinforce my previous statement: do not miss the complimentary breakfast! Chef Bernardo and team, you made our culinary experience, both for our wedding and our stay there, one we will never forget! The Spa is unforgettable; they grow their own herbs and make their own oils. Getting a treatment while you are there is a must! If you are trying to get away from it all, avoid crows and large resorts, and find a place where you and your family can escape, Esencia is it. It is such a personalized experience, that you feel like a house guest. Lane and I plan to return to Esencia as often as we can, and will never go anywhere else in Mexico. Why would you? Thank you to everyone at Hotel Esencia for all that you did for us! We love you!

While on the Mayan Riviera we frequent a few places that add an element of luxury or authenticity (sometimes both) to our Mexican experience. I thought I'd share some of them with you without (hopefully) writing a tome about it. But, you never know. I'll start with hotel Esencia and may submit some more entries later. Here it goes: Hotel Esencia on Xpu-Ha beach A former private retreat of an Italian Dutchess of the Ferrari family (so the story goes), this exquisite 29 room hotel is situated on the gorgeous stretch of Xpu-Ha beach south of Playa del Carmen and a couple of miles south of Puerto Aventuras. Reservations for breakfast are required as the property is gated and a guard at the gate must have your name on the list to let you through. Once through the first gate you reach the second gate at the welcoming palapa where you park your car, leaving the keys with the guard and get a ride on a golf cart to the main house of the hotel. The ride through the jungle is interesting during the day and beautiful at night, with low lights lining the narrow path. I don't know how they keep these jungles clear over such a large area. Once at the main building you are led into the reception office where they ask you to leave a visa imprint with them (to guarantee payment I guess) and then you are escorted to the restaurant by the pool in front of the beach. Some of these formalities are sometimes waved because we have become regulars, but the visa imprint is always taken. I ceased to be offended by it as this is their custom and the experience is worth it. The breakfast (and lunch) restaurant is served at the poolside pavilion situated right off the gorgeous beach beside the pool and it is beautiful. The staff speaks English (we practice our Spanish) and the food and service are high end. The tables are covered with white cloth and are shaded by a roof. It's airy and bright and the view of the pool, the beautiful grounds, white sandy beach and turquoise waters beyond is simply breathtaking. Breakfast is pure luxury. The menu offers local specialties and the more familiar International selections. Chilaquilles with fried eggs, juevos rancheros, grilled poblano with scrambles eggs and chorizo and Mexican scrambles eggs are offered along with poached eggs in artichoke heart with foamy hollandaise (exquisite) , waffles, French toast and more. You can see the menu on their website.The coffee they serve is premium brand Cafe Koba from the Chiapas region, one of the best coffee sources in Mexico. It has a full flavour and is served freshly brewed in a French press in one or four cup presses. The milk is hot (that's how we like it) and it's fun sitting with a cup at the end of breakfast planning the rest of the day. We always follow breakfast with a long beach walk and a swim at either end of Xpu-Ha. The water is usually lovely for swimming and the whole experience memorable.", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "rio de janeiro", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful\u201d", "Author": "david s", "ReviewID": "UR123276696", "Content": "totally nice, lovely, we liked too much and would try to come back soon. fancy, delicious and peaceful", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bloomfield Hills, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cAlmost Perfect Place to Pull Up A Chair and Forget The World\u201d", "Author": "lgaynor", "ReviewID": "UR123265558", "Content": "We have stayed at all the best places in the area including Mandarin Oriental, Rosewood, Maroma (our favorite), Paradisio, so we were intrigued to try Esencia. We love small resorts that we don't have to leave and offer personalized service. Upon arrival, there are no flaming arches announcing the resort, instead you pull into a private road where you are met by an Esencia employee. You are then taken by golf cart to the main house where you check in (awkward process) and receive a glass of lemonade. You get a quick tour of the resort which is quick because the resort is so small but perfect sized. The suites are OK. Very little storage space, no drawers and the windows don't open in the bedroom area. Great view of the ocean, nice rain shower and balcony. Loaded iPod music is nice touch, fresh fruit replenished daily and a welcome bottle of wine was included. There are two pools. The adult pool is seldom used but perfect if the water was a bit warmer. The kids pool is literally right across, a bit smaller and a bit warmer. Unfortunately, the restaurant for breakfast and lunch is located in this area. And yes, this place is not for kids and luckily, they have no kids camp, no kids activities and kids anything. But we did see kids daily. The beach is beautiful and the lounge chairs are covered by individual hatched areas although some are very close together. Beach service is spotty but effective. Ocean is not roped off and has plenty of dangerous rocky areas which was surprising. But no seaweed, perfect 1.5 mile of sandy stretch and a few downtrodden and abandoned resorts along the way. We spent each day at the beach and loved it. The main restaurant open for dinner offers a broad menu and the fresh fish is done very well. The chef, Bernardo, is friendly and will accomodate your requests but speaks little English so be patient. Good wine list and moderately priced. Breakfast is typical assortment of dishes, they can update their fruit and oatmeal quality. Lunch is outstanding. The spa is very nice and they offer any type of treatment, massages recommended. Stay away from salon services. Nice changing area, steam and assorted whirlpool baths with varied temperatures. No amenities so if using the shower area, you have to bring your own toiletries. This needs to be updated. Bad news: No gym. First luxury resort with no gym we have encountered. I have no idea what guests do when it rains. There is yoga offered at 8AM but the area is right in front of guest rooms and hidden from the beach. Staff is very friendly and after a few days, remembers your requests. They will do most anything for you, just be a little patient at times. Management is typically not present and Philip makes it to the resort about once a week. Their take on Esencia is that they want to be like living in your own home so they don't want to bother the guests, have anything with their logo on it and even go to the point of not having bathroom signs indicating men or women. The main house has a living room area, small library, TV and WIFI (no WIFI in the room but they can arrange for it). There are no lounges or bars to hang out, afternoon tea seemed popular. Most guests were European and languages varied across the board. If you want to do nothing like we do, this is a great place to visit. We never left the resort and loved it. The food is varied enough so you don't get tired of it either.

I would recommend this property to any couples looking to literally remove themselves from the world for however long they wish. Personally, three days/nights feels like the perfect amount of time here - you have the ability to leave the property, but you won't want to. This experienced epitomized a relaxing 'beach vacation' - the rooms are great...private, clean, comfortable etc. Service couldn't have been better - almost seemed as if there were five visible hotel employees for every one guest. The food is perfect (can pretty much order whatever you want) - but again, to the earlier point about three nights being a solid duration, you're eating at the same restaurant/from the same menu unless you leave the property (25 mins to the town)...so good to be mindful that a week at this hotel, for us, would have felt drawn out. We felt that after three nights, we left at the peak of our time there...which turns out to be a great feeling. The beach couldn't be better/more private...and the spa serves it's purpose. You fly into Cancun and it's ~45mins to the hotel, which goes by quickly. The hotel certainly makes you feel at home - as advertised. We'd 100% go back, even before trying a new spot - and another thing I'd look to do is bring 5-10 couples out there for a vacation - I could see that being a great time.

Although the restaurant choice is limited, the chef (Samuel) will prepare anything you want. And if you don't like it, he'll try again (and is happy to do so). The concierge will do their best to plan whatever trip you want and give you the best advice on surrounding areas. While laying out by the pool or at the beach, whatever you may need, someone will bring it to you. I can't say enough positive things about the people who work at Esencia - they were amazing! The hotel/beach: So beautiful! We stayed in one of the garden suites and it was perfect. We had our own plunge pool (which they cleaned out daily), our own porch area, and a beautiful room. The rooms are simple and white with few decorations, but this adds to the serene and calm feeling. And I have never seen such a beautiful beach. The water was so blue and clear and the sand was so white. You could see straight through the water and there wasn't even anything on the sand in the ocean - it was so pristine. The food/drinks: Delicious! Samuel was amazing and there wasn't anything that we disliked. And the margaritas were my favorite! They were so simple but so yummy. I had one everyday. The spa: Unlike any experience I've ever had. They incorporate Mayan traditions into everything that they do, from the clothes they wear to the ritual they do to start the massage. And the hot tubs are open to the outdoors, which makes you feel like a part of nature - so cool! Overall, I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for somewhere calm and relaxing.

We were all meeting there to celebrate my father\u2019s 70th birthday. It wasn\u2019t easy finding a resort that could satisfy each of us however this beautiful resort did just that.

The staff was so friendly and very helpful no matter where we were within the resort. Prior to arriving, I had corresponded with Estella in the concierge office and she was so helpful in helping me plan our vacation.

It's easy to find (we rented a car and drove there by ourselves), the concierge provided us with the detailed driving instructions and map by e-mail prior to our arrival. It's very conveniently located approx. 1,5hrs from Cancun airport, 25 min. from Playa del Carmen, 30 min. to Tulum, 2hrs to Cichen Itza and minutes away from numerous cenotas surrounding the hotel! From the hotel parking lot you're taken by buggy car to your room - this drive through the rain forest takes another minute or two. 2) The Premises. It's gorgeous! The villas are nestled in the lush garden (or more accurately a manicured rain forest) full of various birds, iguanas and local animals, all harmless though)) We stayed at the Garden view suite - a spacious room decorated in local style which has a bath tub, inside and outside shower, walk-in wardrobe, safe box, porch in front entrance and small back yard with a plunge pool. The mini bar in the room is free and refilled daily. The drinking water is free as well. Wi-fi is available in the main house but if you bring your laptop you can connect in your room via cable (also provided for free). There are 2 swimming pools in front of the main building: one is for adults only, the other one is for families with kids. The hotel is family-friendly but those who travel without kids shouldn't bother - it's very unlikely that anything will distract you. 3) The Beach. It's truly amazing! It's very clean, the sand is white and smooth, and the water is turquoise. We were afraid of the rocks and sea weeds, and I should mention that there is a rock right in front of the entrance, but the beach is miles long, so if you walk 60 ft to the right or to the left you won't meet any difficulties entering the sea. As for the weeds I beleive the tides may bring some, although we haven't seen any. There are no water sport activites (for those who are interested) but the beachboy will set up sun beds in a cabana for you and you can order some drinks or snacks from the restaurant, so it's total relaxation) or you can take a stroll along the beach - there're some other properties along the beach as well, but most of them look abandoned, so you have to share the beach only with the small hotel next to Esencia (but they do have its own beach cabanas and restaurant). 4) The food. The most exciting thing was fresh pastry and brewed coffee or tea that is delivered to your room every morning before the breakfast. I gained several pounds, but it was worth it!)) The breakfast is a la carte but it's included in the room rate (It's served from 7am to 10 am, after that time it's charged to your account). The poolside restaurant is open from early morning till dinner time, and the main restaurant is open for dinner only. The food is gourmet and you don't really want to go somewhere else to eat. 5) The SPA. I guess we tried everything that SPA could offer and I highly recommend it to everyone. They blend the natural ingredients for each treatment individually, so even if you have a sensitive skin give it a try) 6) The Service. It was really exceptional. The personnel is very friendly and helpful. They met and exceeded all our expectations. Almost everybody spoke good English so we didn't have any communication problems. 7) Overall Experience. This is a place for those seeking for luxury and calm. The Mayan Rivera is quite expensive part of Yucatan Peninsula. If you're planning to hang out outside the hotel a lot, it's reasonable to rent a car. In my opinion the hotel is a couples/families destination not singles/friends one (it's only my opinion though). Can't think of anything else at the moment, would be glad to answer any questions))", "Date": "June 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cPerfect honeymoon\u201d", "Author": "MLG21", "ReviewID": "UR112910949", "Content": "Today is the last day of our 8-day honeymoon here at Esencia and we loved every moment of our experience so much we just had to write about it. From the minute you step into Esencia, you feel like you are transported to a magical, peaceful, otherworldly locale. After you drive through the gates, you enter into a small, rustic Mayan hut smelling of wonderful incense and from there, you are driven in a small golf cart through a maze of tropical trees and foilage to reach the main property. The estate is nothing short of breathtaking (was a former home of an Italian duchess) and feels less like a hotel than a private, lush, incredibly luxurious and expansive home. Yes, it is pricey but it is a high end luxury resort and you certainly get what you pay for. We'd recommend checking out the website Luxury Link --- we found a great package for 7 nights on that site that included daily breakfast, a 3 course meal at the hotel's gourmet restaurant, a bottle of wine upon arrival and 2 one-hour spa treatments. ROOMS - There are ocean view rooms and garden view rooms and while we were initially interested in switching to an ocean view, we immediately fell in love with the garden view rooms. The hotel concierge told us that they often find that couples end up preferring the garden rooms to the ocean ones because compared to the ocean view rooms which are exposed at 360 degrees to the main restaurant/pool/beach, the garden rooms are incredibly private and you feel like you are nested in a beautiful treehouse (ask for a second floor room if you can get it). Our room came with a lovely patio deck and a plunge pool with a magnificent, unobstructed view of the expansive greenery. The bed is plush and very comfortable --- great sheets. We loved the homey touches: the iPod pre-programmed with an awesome playlist of music, the complimentary, automatically replenished bowls of fresh fruit and the fridge of beer, juice and water, the candle and scented oil that was burned every night at turndown. Every morning we awoke to a fresh basket of delicious pastries and a pot of coffee placed out on our patio. Perfection. FOOD - We are big foodies who were very concerned about our daily fare and the Esencia definitely did not disappoint. The breakfast (after your snack of pastries and coffee) at the restaurant is fabulous --- lots of wonderful authentic Mexican breakfast dishes that were to die for (we loved the breakfast Chile Relleno and Moltoleno Eggs!). Having gotten complimentary breakfast with our package, we expected something like a simple Continental every morning but we were pleasantly mistaken --- we got a full gourmet breakfast every morning gratis and loved it! The lunch menu is similarly fabulous (great cochinita pibil (braised pork tacos) and seafood dishes). And dinner....the formal restaurant only open in the evening is Sal Y Fuego and is absolutely wonderful. We were afraid of getting sick of dining at the place for so many nights but found something new and delicious on the menu every evening. The focus is on fresh seafood with a Mexican/Mayan twist and the food was really, REALLY good. We stepped into town in both Playa del Carmen and Tulum a few nights for meals and yet found the food at the Esencia superb to everything else we tried. Really --- not much of a reason to leave the resort! BEACH/POOL - The resort is situated right on the beautiful white sand beach and every day we had was spent nestled under one of the thatched palapas. It was incredible. The ocean is crystal clear and gentle. The two pools are lovely too but with the beach right there, it's hard to resist! We took a snorkel tour from our beach out a mile or so (ask the concierge to set you up with the tour guide, Lucas, he is fabulous) and it was incredible. SPA - The Aroma Spa was so wonderful we made multiple visits on top of our complimentary services included in our package. The spa experience here is unlike any other spa we've tried --- it incorporates a lot of unique Mayan traditions and has a very spiritual, holistic approach. For instance, before our massages, we were asked to stand on a mat, holding hands with our eyes closed with two women carrying bowls of smoking \"koba\" leaves danced the smoke around us. It is supposed to release any toxins from our being. The massages were fabulous (I loved the \"kukumis\" treatment of aloe and cucumber for sunburnt skin) and ended with a plunge in a private hot tub set up for us. Would not miss the Spa during your trip --- very special. SERVICE - Everyone at the Esencia is incredibly friendly and knows your name; it was amazing how attentive they were of our needs and how in tune they already were with who we were, what we liked, what we didn't like, etc. We joked it was almost like being in \"The Truman Show\" because it seemed that everyone knew us so well. The concierge was very helpful --- they arranged snorkel tours and a tour to the Dos Ojos cenotes for us (not to be missed; we loved the cenotes). They also arranged for our private airport transfers (about $100 for a private car from Cancun to Esencia/about an hour drive). We contemplated renting a car at one point but realized we didn't really need it as we spent so much time on the property and getting a cab when going out was so easily facilitated by the concierge. In sum, the Esencia is truly not to be missed. It is a gem in an area of Mexico that is oversaturated with huge, impersonal resorts with thousands of rooms stacked on top of each other. The Esencia -- with its 29 rooms -- is truly worth it; a real place to get away from it all!", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding!!!-That's what we call a vacation!!\u201d", "Author": "prsmke", "ReviewID": "UR110302391", "Content": "From the moment you arrive to Esencia you feel connected with nature and Mayan culture.

However, Esencia was great in getting us the transportation airport-hotel, taxi to go to Playa del Carmen and Hotel-Cancun. I had a different image of downtown Playa del Carmen, it was kind of disappointing, it is very commercialized already. 5th ave is quite long to walk, there are a lot of restaurants but stores are not as unique as I thought they would be. Beach is nice but nothing compared to Esencia's beach front. We took the tour with Carlos Antonio Hotow Diaz, highly recommended!! you can take your time and experience authentic food. We did Chichen Itza, Coba and Ikal (Cenote)- he was very professional and Rafael our guide in Chichen Itza was \"substantial\". Now that it is forbidden to climb there, you definitely want to do it in Coba, it gives you a different perspective and dimension of those constructions besides the amazing view when you're on top of it!! It was our first time in Mexico, so we didn't go to Xcaret but for sure we will check it out next time, specially the night show was highly recommended to us. Instead we stayed in Cancun the last couple nights and even we knew it was too commercial, after being at Esencia was a tough transition. All those all included places are suitable for most people but we rather have the option to experience the places we're at, Esencia definitely provided that.

The trip was to be a relaxing Beach/Spa destination, My massage was not even close to what I was expecting, in a word it was \"bad\", however in true Esencia style it was very expensive and once again a rip off. If you are considering staying at Esencia (Spanish for rip me off) I would strongly suggest you think three times about it and go some where else.

The grounds are breath taking and instantly you feel like you have been transported to a different world. There is still the lingering feel of a different era combined with a lush, tropical aura. As a private estate in the 1920s, we felt like we were staying at someone's amazing private residence. The staff was amazingly friendly and helpful and overall the resort was extremely well appointed. The water is stunning - electric blue with white sandy beaches and there was never an issue of not getting a spot on the beach - plenty of chairs and cabanas for all guests. The food was also great - we especially enjoyed breakfast! French pressed coffee was to die for! We also enjoyed the coffee and breakfast rolls left in our room each morning - they leave it in a nifty cabinet on the patio. Just watch out for the birds as they tend to steal the rolls! Overall - anyone looking to escape in the lap of true luxury would love Esencia. The resort is a quiet sanctuary that provides a real escape and the personal touches are great. Fromt he moment you arrive, you are greeted by their friendly staff and taken around the resort. \"Checking\" in is a 5 minute process if that as they offer you freshly made lemonade ata table outside looking out at the water. AMAZING! One thing to note with traveling to/from resort - like most resorts in this region, a taxi to/from downtown Playa Del Carmen is about $20 plus tip, so approx. $50 RT. It is worthwhile to go downtown at least one night or 2, however it does get pricey adding in the cab.

Esencia is amazing. I came here for a week with my boyfriend, and we couldn't have been happier with the service and personal touches. They bring you pastries and coffee every morning and put the goodies in a cute little cupboard on your patio to keep them fresh and away from the birds. Birds, you ask? Yes, birds. You are in the jungle. I put our leftovers back outside this morning (... just trying to help), and my boyfriend saw a bird fly away with an entire pastry in his mouth. The staff have an amazing way of making sure you are taken care of without hovering over you. I am a vegetarian (my boyfriend is an English carnivore), but the chef Bernardo made sure my needs were met and made special dishes for me. Breakfast is amazing (and included). They bring you coffee in a French press! Even if you aren't a breakfast person, try it out. Seriously, practically everything comes with asparagus or a side of awesome. Here's what's great about Esencia. The week we were there, the hotel was full, but it never felt that way. It's the perfect mix between having enough people so you don't feel like you're alone in the Mexican jungle and being *just enough alone* so that you don't get annoyed searching for an empty chaiselounge or cabanna made out of straw. (Yes, they are made out of straw.) They have a separate pool for children in case you are like us and don't have them and want to admire them from afar but have your own space. They also have a repertoire of DVDs that you can borrow for free! My boyfriend just rented us \"The Reader\" and \"Vicky Christina Barcelona.\" In terms of improvement (I have to list a few things because there's always room for improvement), there isn't wi-fi everywhere. We are sort of psycho New Yorkers who are unable to unplug, so it would have been nice to take the laptop to the bed to check news and whatnot on occasion. (Seriously, we came here and the Middle East blew up.) They did give us an Internet cable, so we could check e-mail/Internet from the desk. It's also difficult to socialize, in a way. There isn't a pool bar or anywhere to congregate between lunch and dinner. I think the resort could benefit from a bar near the pool where people could chat and whatnot. That said, there is a lovely lounge connected to the restaurant, which is open at dinner, and my boyfriend and I saddled up for some nice evening cocktails. (Again, New Yorkers.) I have read that some people think the food is expensive, but I have to say that's part of vacationing at a luxury resort. My boyfriend and I would split lunch sometimes and were a little cautious of our spending, but I wouldn't say that prices were overly exorbitant. Breakfast is included, and you are treated to fruit throughout the day. In sum, everyone is just absolutely lovely and genuinely happy to take care of you. Isn't this what you want on a holiday? It's what we wanted, and we couldn't have been happier. We will be back. (Or I hope we will be back.

These unattractive surroundings may be part of the reason why guests stay put, as well as the many virtues of the hotel itself. The lay-out has been well-planned. Once inside the gates, the grounds are long and narrow, with only a limited beach frontage; most of the rooms have no sea view, and from the ones nearer the entrance you can hear the traffic, albeit some way off. Nevertheless, the prevailing atmosphere is one of calm; the grounds are beautifully done,the two pools are very pretty,and the paths are lit at night to give the desired romantic look. It is a huge piece of good fortune [for the Esencia guests] that the hotel to the north was put out of business by a hurricane, so that about a kilometre of beach, right to the northern end, is unoccupied.It's a good beach, not the most idyllic, but fine cool sand [not the sort that burns the soles of your feet] gently shelving into the turquoise water. It contains no beach hawkers, nor did we see any motorised watersports, so it is delightfully easy to let the whole day slip by in peaceful idleness. There are lots of nice small touches which have been mentioned elsewhere [great bathrooms, afternoon tea, book and DVD repositories, iced flannels, pre-breakfast tea/coffee and pastries,] all of which we enjoyed. We were not sold on the pleasures of swimming in the ruined hotel's cenote; what we were shown was not a cenote at all, but a small natural harbour at the sea point. It was slippery to enter and exit, and the fish were not amazing in type or volume. However the walk to the inlet was interesting, like a scene from a post-apocalypse movie. Because of the short days in the tropics there is an in-between hour or so before dinner, too dark for the beach, too early to eat. Maybe everyone else was beautifying themselves for dinner, and we were the only ones who would have liked to sit with a drink looking at the sky and perhaps the sea [it does get windy after dark], but the restaurant bar was indoors and lacking the panache of the other facilities. Perhaps as a result it was very under-used. The restaurant itself is charming, excellent food and service. Finally, all of the staff at the Esencia were wonderfully helpful - particular thanks to Juan and Fidel and the beach butlers - and extremely efficient.

We stayed for 7 days, and had an amazing time there! We purchased a package via LuxuryLink.com which was great and saved a bunch on the room rates. (Our package included 7 nights in a garden suite with private plunge pool, dinner one night, breakfast everyday, one 60 min spa treatment each, and welcome basket.) First, I want to highly recommend LuxuryLink. It helped us to afford a place we otherwise wouldn't have been able to...and their service was great. Pros for Esencia: 1. Gorgeous hotel and grounds. Definitely THE BEST in the area. We walked the beach and felt like we were truly getting the best experience. The rooms were impeccable, beautiful, and relaxing...and air conditioned! We loved staying in our room just relaxing in our private pool! 2. Bed & Sheets. So comfy. My husband wanted to bring the pillows home with him. I'd love to know where they bought them! 3. The Aroma Spa. Don't even THINK about staying here without going to that spa at least twice (or more if you can afford it)!! We had one spa treatment included with our package and loved it so much, that we splurged for another right before we left. The \"Cuatro Elements\" and \"Lx Chel\" massages were out of this world. (Especially the Lx Chel.) They are way more than just a massage. The essential oils, incense ritual, steam room, cold jacuzzi, and relaxation station that come with the massage are priceless, and included in the cost. I seriously wanted to bring those ladies home with me because every one of them was serenity personified. 4. Staff. The wait staff at the restaurant was so wonderful and began to feel like friends by the end of our stay. There were so few people staying at the resort that we spent a lot of time chatting with them by the pool, etc. It was a great time, and they had good recommendations about places to go in Playa, etc. Also the concierge service was super helpful. We had an incident with our car, and they helped to resolve it and made sure that it didn't ruin our honeymoon. 5. Overall low-key quiet. This place is SMALL. And we were there during the off-season so there were only about 8 rooms filled of the 26. It felt like we were at our own private resort. Very few people eating in the restaurant with us or on the beach with us. Dreamy. 6. Private plunge pool. I already mentioned it, but we loved it so much that it deserved it's own call-out. 7. The other 2 hotel pools. Lovely. 8. Ceviche. OUTSTANDING. Neutral: 1. The beach itself. It was GREAT for snorkeling and the water was very clear. The water was warm. But almost immediately in the ocean begins a coral reef, which is really hard on your feet/body if you get tossed around in the surf. I kept wishing I had water shoes. Otherwise, the beach was quiet, beautiful and relaxing. So MOSTLY a positive, actually. 2. Overall food at Esencia. Breakfast was very good, with some options being better than others. (Chilequiles, Chile Relleno, and the French Toast were our favorites.) Lunch was amazing every single day. Those ceviches were to die for, and each one was worth trying, as previously mentioned. The dinner menu was not our favorite at all though. We struggled to find things we liked as much as the lunch menu. After about 3-4 days we began to fill limited though. (I guess that's what you get for going to a small resort though.) We finally realized that we could order lunch items at dinner when our time was almost up. Also, the food pricing was strange (and slightly high for some items we thought). It made no sense why a salad would cost as much as a dinner entree...and a burger. There weren't the normal pricing tiers that you expect at most restaurants. We ended up going out to Playa del Carmen a few nights for food. The desserts were amazing though. Definitely try those if you don't mind the extra calories. Cons: 1. Outside the resort isn't so pretty. That's what you get for choosing Mexico though. It's not Hawaii after all. 2. Children are allowed. We're not the kind of people that dislike having children around. In fact, for the first 6 days of our stay there was a couple with one child that was very low-key and quiet. It was great. However, near the end of a stay a large group showed up with about 6-7 kids in tow. Even though Esencia is kid-friendly, it's not a \"kids\" resort by any stretch, and it seemed weird to us that these people would choose this resort. The kids were loud, and so were their parents. We were glad that they weren't there the entire time, or we might have had a different honeymoon experience. (That being said, I will give props to the hotel for really trying to keep kids out of certain areas such as the spa and the \"grown-up\" pool. Kids can have spa treatments in their room if the parents want to get them...which is pretty cool. That helped create a buffer zone where at least we weren't right there with them often. It was mostly noticeable in the dining room.) A few suggestions: 1. Plan a snorkeling trip to the coral reef with Lucas. He's an awesome guy, takes photos for you, and we had a blast!!! 2. Use the hotel-provided snorkeling gear just hanging out in the ocean by yourself. It made my frustration with the coral near the beach not as bad. I wish I'd realized they had snorkel gear for guests to use earlier than I did. 3. Ask for Taida to do a massage. They were all great, but both my husband and I agree that she was particularly talented. 4. Park in a parking garage if you go to Playa del Carmen. Our rental car was broken into while we were there buying souvenirs, and my husband's phone was stolen. (He accidentally left it inside between the seats.) We had to pay for the broken glass and a new phone. 5. Utilize the concierge at the hotel as much as possible for your planned outings. We wished we'd used them more b/c our best outings were via their guides. 6. There's an old resort down the beach that is basically abandoned called La Espuja. If you ask the concierge at Esencia, you can get a security pass to go explore it. There is a private lagoon on that property that you can swim in. It was soooo cool, and felt like we were on a movie set. Loved every moment of that, and glad we asked questions to the wait staff about it.", "Date": "June 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Service": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cLow Key Luxury . . .\u201d", "Author": "btpla", "ReviewID": "UR67792007", "Content": "Esencia is a pristine, laid-back, yet luxurious vacation spot for people who like quiet, intimate hotels.

The staff learns your name within a day, and will try and get you anything you ask for. A waiter went and picked a coconut off a tree and served it because one of the other guests expressed an interest in trying fresh coconut milk! The food was also incredible.

Yes, it was pricey all around, but if you are traveling on a tight budget this is definitely not the place for you. Even though it was an expensive week, I would definitely do it all over again. The service at Esencia is the best I have ever experienced. When you first arrive at the hotel, you drive up to a small Mayan hut (it sounds rustic, but it's very beautiful). Right as we got out of our car, we were greeted by several workers who introduced themselves and shook hands with us. After quickly checking in, our luggage was whisked away and my family boarded a golf cart which drove down to where the main area of the hotel is. Once we got there, another worker greeted us and took us on a walking tour of the resort's grounds, spa, pools, and finally to our room. It was great - when we got to our room, the iPod stereo system was turned on and playing relaxing music and minutes later the concierge sent up complimentary cocktails for the adults and (kiddie)cocktails for the kids. Everyday at Esencia is special. After several days of eating at the hotel's restaurants (which are actually quite good) the waitstaff really got to know our family; towards the end of the trip many of the workers even knew the kids' names. One of my favorite things that the hotel did was every morning, pastries and coffee/tea/hot cocoa would be delivered to your room (again, complimentary). We were able to schedule a specific time for the food to arrive. It was great to wake up and eat croissants on our private balcony. Some of the little details really added up to make this a great trip. For example, the concierge office has a huge DVD selection. You can rent any of the movies for as long as you want at no charge at all. Here's a tip: many of the movies are in Spanish. However, if the movie was originally recorded in English, you can always change the language back to English through the DVD menu on TV. Right off the main lobby, there is a small library with a good selection of books and magazines that you can read for free during your trip. There's one more point I would like to stress: some people have complained that the dinner menu was way too limited and consisted mainly of seafood. There is no need to worry about this! At Esencia, we were able to ask for just about anything in particular to meet our dietary requests. One member of my family was particularly picky about what she would eat (pretty much only chicken). However, the waiters were extremely accommodating and the chef was ready to specially prepare any dish to please her. Bottom line: Esencia is an amazing resort that words cannot describe.

Heard about Esencia when researching Rosewood and Banyan Tree Mayakoba online, and reviews indicated that it was child friendly. Esencia exceeded our expectations. It is, quite simply, the best experience we have had at any resort, and we have stayed at \"the best\" for many years. We stayed at a 2 bedroom cottage, which was beautiful. Expensive, but in terms of prior villas at Ritz and other brands in the Caribbean, it delivered value. The grounds were beautiful and were maintained immaculately. The pools and beach were beautiful. The beach was nicer than any we have visited, including Cayman, the Grenadines, Barbados, Jamaica, and many locations in Mexico. What set Esencia apart, though, was the food and service. The food was excellent, especially the ceviche. For kids, the chef will pretty much do whatever you want. They catered to our younger children's needs no matter what was was requested. The drinks were also excellent, especially the margarita and mojito. Breakfast was outstanding and varied. The setting for breakfast was beautiful. The service, at all levels, was outstanding. This was especially true of the restaurant/bar service and the beach service. The Ritz chain (Naples and Cayman in the past year) pales in comparison. This is what sets the resort apart, and by a lot. We especially appreciated the attention of Juan and Elias. The kids, in spite of no \"kid's club\" or high tech kids stuff, all said that it had been their best vacation, and they are fortunate to vacation a lot.

We arrived at Escencia after 10 nights in Ecuador and The Galapagos Islands, which had been fabulous. Our first impressions of Esencia did not disappoint. The complex was quiet and very private. Our room was luxurious. The photographs on Escencia's website are accurate. We had a Garden Suite with a plunge pool. The room was spotlessly clean. The bed was large, comfortable and had a luxurious duvet and pillows and the bathroom was beautiful with a double vanity unit, large walk in shower, large deep bath and a walk-in closet. At the front of our suite we had a large terrace with a table, two chairs and sofa. At the rear we had a secluded terrace with plunge pool, outdoor shower and two sun-loungers. However, our honeymoon was a holiday of a life time and we had scrimped and saved and had little money left over to spend whilst on it. This had not caused any problems in Ecuador and The Galapagos Islands where the price of food and drink was reasonable; it did at Esencia. I have to agree with a previous review that describes the mentality of Esencia being that of 'milk the rich'. Unfortunately, we are not rich. Our travel agent had got us a good deal at Escencia and we hadn't considered the price of food and drink. We too noted the $550 (USD) charge for the pre-loaded ipod nano (which is old and very much used) on check in. We declined although they left an ipod in our room for free use whilst staying there. I was paranoid that they would try to charge us for the week's use of something we hadn't asked for, but fortunately they didn't! Meal times. The food is reasonable and the service is generally good. However, the food is over-priced. We completely resented paying what were near to Michelin star prices for food that was certainly not of that quality. On one evening, my husband ordered scallops as a starter. They were cold and so he sent them back. It does not take long to cook scallops from fresh as they are seared. Instead, the kitchen reheated his scallops! We were charged $21 for reheated scallops and that was only the starter! As a previous reviewer states the location is rather remote. We did go to Puerto Aventuras one night for dinner becasue we were so fed-up with Esencia prices (roughly $20 for a starter and $30 for a main course), but found Puerto Aventuras such an awful commercialised place in which the restaurant we ate at was truly terrible, we remained at the hotel subsequently (and gritted our teeth at the hotel prices). Wine. Wine is horrendously expensive at Esencia. When we are on holiday we like to enjoy a bottle of wine with a meal in the evening - especially as this was our honeymoon. The cheapest bottle is $42. The charge for a small glass of wine is $15. This is extortionate. You can buy the cheapest bottle they have on the menu for 158 pesos ($12) in the Wal-Mart in Playa del Carmen. In addition to the extortionate price, the waiting staff aren't particularly good on the etiquette of wine. Every evening we were given the wine list and asked to order from it before being given the food menu. The staff always loked perplexed when we explained that we like to choose what we wanted to eat first and then an appropriate wine to match the food. On one occassion we ordered a bottle of Australian Sauvignon Blanc (price $50). The waiter disappeared to come back to tell us that there was none left, but there was a Chilean Sauvignon Blanc available for the same price, would we accept this as an alternative. We said we would as long as it was no more expensive. He came to the table, showed as the bottle and opened it (screw cap). He then told us it was 'slightly more expensive'. We asked how much it was. We were told $57. I call that a bit more than slightly more expensive. Obviously, now having opened it, I guess they expected us to drink it. We sent it back. My husband was fuming. We then ordered a cheaper bottle of wine. However, I did notice when we sent the more expensive bottle back, the screw cap was replaced and it was put in the fridge. I do wonder if that was served to anybody else as a fresh bottle? I very much hope they either disposed of it, or used it that night to serve wine by the glass. Finally, there is no place to relax and have an after dinner drink. You have to do this at the restaurant. The bar by the pool closes at 9pm. My husband and I wanted to sit in a more relaxed environment than the restaurant and so we decided to order digestivs to the room. We called concierge to be told their is an additional 25% charge on all room service items. We refused to pay this and my husband said he would go to the bar at the restaurant to collect the drinks. We were told there is an additional 15% charge to take drinks away to consume in your room. Another caveat. There is a complimentary minibar in the room which contains lots of water, two cans of Coke, two cans of diet Coke and 2 bottles of beer. This is a nice touch. However, we noticed in the information pack in the room that if you take the drinks from your room to another part of the hotel, you will be (surprise surprise) charged. Lunch - I can't actually comment on this. We didn't eat lunch at all because we couldn't afford it. Breakfast - this was very good and included in our room rate. There is also a lovely selection of breads delivered to the room first thing every morning with fresh coffee. This is complimentary. There was one occassion when a squirrel ran off with our rolls, but concierge were very quick to replace them. Bills - as mentioned by a previous reviewer, bills are not presented at the end of each meal, but an itemised bill is sent to your room every two days. We really didn't like this either. This means that you only find out how much you have spent every two days. With all the added service charges and hidden extras, this made us quite miserable and we constantly worried because we didn't know if we were remainin within our budget. This is not how we should have felt on our honeymoon. Presumably, from the hotel's perspective, we weren't the rich kind of clientele they wish to attract. I despised the fact that I constantly felt that I was too poor to be there. Spa Facilities - The Spa looked beautiful. We booked this hotel partly because of the spa, but we didn't use it because it was cost prohibitive. I believe it was $75 just to use the jacuzzi! In summary beautiful, relaxing and secluded hotel, but the food, wine and service charges were extortionate and because of such I wouldn't stay at this hotel again.", "Date": "February 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, TX", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel that seemed money-grubbing at times\u201d", "Author": "Jemimagold", "ReviewID": "UR55693382", "Content": "We recently stayed at the Escencia for 3 nights. Although it is in a gorgeous setting, what I remember most from my stay is their \"soak the rich\" mentality\". Here are some examples: - During check-in, we were asked if we wanted to purchase the hotel's \"pre-loaded\" IPOD for $550. With no idea of the songs and completely astounded by the price, I asked if they meant 550 pesos but no, they said it was USD 550. Of course, we said no and are still wondering if they've ever had any takers for such an obscenely expensive hotel souvenir. - The food prices at Escencia were incredibly high because given the remote location, guests have no other dining options. For example, an order of cheese quesadillas for one person were $25 plus tip. Our dinner the first night cost $104 (incl. tax/tip) for which I had a baked fish with salsa, my friend had steak and we shared a small lukewarm apple tart for dessert (and our only beverage was their complimentary water). - You are not given a bill after each meal. Rather a cumulative bill is delivered to your room every other day which shows only the total amount spent at each sitting (ie. there is no listing of itemized food and beverage charges). - At checkout, I wanted to get rid of my pesos so I asked how much I would get if applied my 690 pesos to the final bill which was presented in Dollars. The cashier told me that for 690 pesos, I would be credited $5. When I questioned her more closely and asked her what her exchange rate was, she then offered me $48 for them. Rather cat-and-mouse behavior..... Other than their money obsession, Escencia is a stylish quiet resort located directly on long stretch of sandy white beach. Here are the highlights: - Most of the staff were unobtrusive, helpful and professional. We were generally greeted us with a friendly \"hola!\" and any time we asked for something, it was done immediately. - Our room was entirely white-washed and had teak furnishings that gave our room a spare but elegant look. The toiletries were from Molton Brown and our room had a large flat screen tv, the famous IPOD for-sale with assorted \"world music\" and excellent air conditioning. - Escencia had a quiet atmosphere and tended to attract honeymooners and older couples. There was plenty of open space throughout the property and numerous lounge chairs were available at the beach and the 2 pools any time of the day. There was definitely no jockeying for poolchairs. - Complimentary coffee and muffins were left outside our door each morning. As other reviewers have noted, the food attracts the local crows who will start immediately eating it unless you get outside ASAP. We learned this the hard way when our muffins were thoroughly pecked to death one morning so thereafter we vigilantly retrieved our baked goods the minute we heard the dishes rattling. This could all be avoided if the hotel staff just placed a simple domed screen over the food. Other things to note: - There is no exercise facility. - It makes much more sense to rent a car for the day ($80 for 24 hours, arranged through the Concierge) to visit Tulum and Playa del Carmen than to pay for their expensive tours and taxis. - It takes 1 hour to get from the Cancun airport to Escencia by car.", "Date": "February 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful place, Beautiful hotel\u201d", "Author": "jpcdo", "ReviewID": "UR54623275", "Content": "This hotel is very nice, you really get a luxury feel when you arrive here for the first time.

From the moment that we arrived, with Eduardo behind the wheel and shuttling us from the airport to the unassuming and unpretentious entrance of Esensia, we could immediately sense that this was going to be a place to remember. We were greeted at the gate house (a traditional vernacular Mayan dwelling) with a warm, genuine smiles and an a sensibility of accommodation based around confidence and quiet charm. Snaking our way down a narrow gravel path in a chauffeured golf cart through the jungle, the sound of the passing cars on the main thoroughfare began to fade and the glory of this wonderful place began to take hold. Evidently there are about 26 units sprinkled among the verdant and well kept grounds, yet you would never think that this would be the case. We were given a tour of the main public areas; the amazingly grand and well appointed spa, the two open air bar and restaurant palapas-understated and elegantly simple, the main villa-amazing, two pool areas, and the traditional Mayan tamezcal (sweat lodge). All along the way the staff (grounds keepers, waiters, and concierge) everyone was cordial, pleasant and helpful. Our room, a ground-floor unit of a two story structure, was tastefully simple with a large comfortable bed, ajoining bathroom, a walk-in shower and a private outdoor \"chill\" area with an amazing \"plunge pool\" that was automatically heated every evening when we returned from dinner and drinks. Nice touch! Coffee and croissants were served each morning on the quaint front covered porch in quiet anticipation. Our breakfast meals were included with our package and were enjoyed at the beach front palapa; The grapefruit and orange juices were sumptuously fresh, the eggs machacado and the chili relleno stuffed with seasoned eggs and covered with fresh light cheese were off the hook. My mate, who is a pepper-belly asked for a sampling of all their salsas and she was pleasantly rewarded with a delicious array of pico de gallo, pickled onion and a habanero salsa that became the hallmark for these gringos. Hot, hot and hotter! Muy Cabron. The lunch and dinner menus are equally savory; The cold avocado soup, side vegetables, rice, and seafood were lovingly prepared and beautifully presented. Again, my mate, who is a foodie, was especially blown away by the green cerviche; Generous, marinated chuncks of Grouper in a delicate citrus base. Our waiters were always inconspicuously attentive, gracious and helpfully conversant. Margaritas? Refreshingly tart with a hint of sweet-order them with the Don Julio Silver tequilla instead of the Reposada. It is this attention to detail, seemingly insignificant, yet subtle, that we came to appreciate about Esensia. After drinking a few of those Margaritas on the beach, watching the sun set into the western sky, I realized the next morning that I had left my Raybans behind. Frantically I searched everywhere and finding no clues, I approached the concierge with my dashed hopes. He quickly produced them from the closet and said that they were found on the beach.

I took my wife to Esencia for our honeymoon, and it was the perfect choice. This was by far the best service we had ever experienced at a hotel. Catalina and Nicholas at the concierge desk were very helpful setting up excursions for us, and giving us restaurant recommendations in Playa. Omar and all of the waitstaff were great. They anticipated our needs and really took excellent care of us. The food was great. We ate breakfast everyday poolside. I had the french toast twice during the stay because it was the best I have ever had. We were so full from breakfast that for lunch we often had something light like guacamole and chips. I also had several of their ceviches, and they were all excellent. Their seafood was always fresh and very good. For dinner, the hotel restaurant is under a large palapa roof and is open-air. They light it up with lots of candles, and it is very romantic. There were few people at the hotel during our stay, and we were often the only people in the restaurant at night. One night we went into Playa for shopping. Nicholas recommended El Fogon as a restaurant with local flavor. Most of the other customers were locals, and we had fajitas which were excellent. The beach at Esencia is very nice. They take great pains in keeping it clean from seaweed and other debris. The water is clear and good for swimming. There are a few rocky areas which provide opportunity for snorkeling 10 meters or so out. We went on several long walks down the beach, and as you move away from the Esenica you do see some trash on the beach, but not much. Of course, this is out of their control. We stayed in a Garden Suite room with a plunge pool. The upgrade to a room with a plunge pool was free since the hotel was not full during our stay. The rooms have ipod docking stations which we enjoyed playing our music. The shower room is very nice and big with two large shower heads. The room had a new Philips flat screen tv and sony dvd player. We watched a couple of movies during the stay from Esencia's DVD collection.

The booking went very smoothly and Maria et others were very responsive to my requests. A couple of weeks before my departure I got an email from Esencia to break the good news that there was a cancellation in one of their exclusive villas and that I was offered a free upgrade for the first two nights! Anyway, we got there on d day, transfer and check in were really smooth then we were taken on a cart through the jungle for a tour of the hotel. We were really impressed. This is basically an untouched jungle with wonderful villas and suites scattered here and there. Then we werre shown to our villa. I cannot even start to describe how wonderful it was. I'll let the pictures speak for themselves. A couple of days later we were transferred to our suite (i.e while we were on the beach sipping a cocktail, the staff packed our stuff and moved it to the suite without bothering us) and it was as nice, with the ocean view on one side and the jungle view on the other side. I may have gone on for ages about how nice the setting is, and the colour of the water...etc but I think what sets this hotel apart is really the SERVICE. I know that many hotels have good intentions of providing a good service but the execution in this hotel is flawless. All the staff from the maids to the waiters to the concierges are really friendly. No over the top fake friendliness or commercial smiles. They listen to you and are genuinely nice and talkative. I will just give a few examples to show how efficient is the service. - We rented a car. The hotel took care of all the arrangements and picked us up from the beach when the Europcar guys came. When I need the car i Just need to call the concierge and a golf cart waits immediately for me to take me to the reception where I find my car waiting for me and the keys handed to me. When I come back to the residence, the doorman opens the doos (after quickly checking the serial number), and calls the reception on talkie walkie. By the time I reach the reception ( a few seconds), a concierge is already waiting for me outside to take the keys and ark the car and a golf cart is waiting to take me to my suite. - The waiters on the beach anticipate your needs. It's incredible. Once we had a picnic arranged by the hotel on the beach and included a bottle of white wine. After a couple of glasses from the bottle, the waiter came and suggested I might need some ice to col the bottle, which I ust did. - In this hotel you basically do not worry about anything and nobody bothers you about any admin stuff and signing stuff. You just ask for something and it's done immediately and it's flawless. All of this of course comes at a price. I went there becuase it's my honeymoon but can't afford this on a regular basis. However if you can, this hotel is really worth the price tag. This review is my thank you note for the hotel, all the staff and the wonderful time we spent there with my wife.

I could not find a bad review of this hotel in the past 2 years, so my expectations going in were extremely high. I booked through www.whatahotel.com and they did a fabulous job of getting me their signature travel benefits. Pick up at the airport was efficient but we were given no help lugging our luggage to the car. After just over an hour\u2019s drive we pulled into a very unassuming entrance and welcomed in the Mayan hut (reception) we thought this was very charming. We were then driven down a small path through the jungle towards the hotel. We were then graciously walked around the property, finally ending up at our room where we found the bags. I was a little disappointed as I had asked for a room nearest the sea, in fact we were given a room farthest away from the sea. At that point we were just pleased to get into a room and changed. This was the high point of the trip; my husband was really pleased with the choice of hotel as it was a surprise treat and looked wonderful before further review. We found all the staff to be very helpful and friendly. Our dining experiences were baffling, we never knew what type of service to expect;(sometimes quickly, sometimes slow and sometimes they remembered us sometimes not). After 5 days of this, the final straw was breakfast at 7am. We were the first and only people in the restaurant\u2026 it took 25 minutes to get a simple omelet and when it finally arrived it was cold. My husband finally blew a gasket, he complained, sent it back, and received a new breakfast within 5 minutes. He also complained to the management about the service and from then on we did receive better service in the restaurants. At first glance, the rooms seem very nice and look much nicer on the website. All rooms had Molten Brown bath products, white cotton robes and haviannas flip flops to use the duration of your stay. Also, the room had a small refrigerator that was stocked daily with complimentary drinks. After closer inspection we noticed the chipping white paint, floors that are never clean unfinished exposed electrical boxes, taped bathroom sink faucets and a musty smell in the room. The first room we were in an animal had pooped outside the front door over night. This mess was never cleaned up; we moved rooms that day to a room nearer the beach. The second room was very noisy due to the wind, rattling the doors, windows and screens. When the wind did die down and we had no a/c on during the night we were woken by road noise from the nearby highway. I had read the pool and beach service was wonderful, we did not experience this at all. In fact, if I wanted water or a drink I needed to go to the restaurant and get one. No one ever came by the pool or beach to ask if we needed anything. The highlight of the day was at 4pm, tea and biscuits were served, on the verandah of the main house, this was wonderful. Another very upsetting thing for me was they completely ignored my husband\u2019s 60th birthday, no card.. no flowers\u2026 no acknowledgement\u2026 of the special day, which was the point of this trip. The spa was wonderful and the treatments were fabulous, it was a haven not to be missed. It would have been nice if there was a gym. Unfortunately, the weather was not great. We had 5 continuous days of very heavy winds. After 7 days we had had enough, I had a terrible stomach bug, (Montezuma\u2019s) and could not eat anything without running to the toilet; my husband had a terrible cold and cough so we decided to leave. At check out, to add insult to injury, the hotel decided to charge us for the 2 days we were not staying. After much shouting and aggravation they did remove the 2 days from the final bill. Not a nice ending to a hotel stay. Overall, it did not feel like a 5 star hotel and definitely not worth the price of the rooms. It didn\u2019t feel like there was anyone in charge of the hotel. It felt like a lack of fine tuning and training for the staff. The rooms need to be finished properly, not patched.

I never had a problem getting a beach hut to lay under as the beach was never crowded. The food was wonderful. I think I tried everything on the breakfast menu. My Favorites for breakfast were the chilaquiles, Rancher eggs, Sardou eggs and the French toast. The spa was nice and sweet with all organic ingredients. I recommend the Yoga as someone stated before. The rooms were very minimalist. They were not my favorite, but I didn't mind them too much either. The hotel as a whole is worth going besides the room. The beds were comfortable and the rain showers were great. This is a place to come and rejuvenate and worry about nothing. If you want to try something fun and different they have kite surfing classes down the beach at a place called FreeStylePlaya. I only ate one meal out of the hotel at a place down the beach. The food was great-- I had Shrimps Diablo. Oh-- and another thing not to be missed is cooking class. You can take the class right there with the hotel chef. They have plenty of free water and they fill your mini bar with a few beers and drinks every day. This is really a nice touch.

We originally planned to make short trips to Playa but we felt so rested and pampered at Esencia that we didn't even bother leaving the hotel! I have stayed at other Small Luxury Hotels and 5 star resorts but it is the little things that Esencia offers that really sets it apart--from tranquility of the estate and the room to the abundance of towels in the bathroom, free flow of drinks in the mini bar,, Haviana slippers provided for your stay and the quiet, efficient attention you receive from the staff there.

My husband and I just got back from our honeymoon there and have vowed to return. Even the gorgeous pictures on their website do not do it justice. When you arrive to the hotel, you are whisked away on a golf cart through the jungle to get to the property. This is the only way in and out of the property, so if you plan on leaving a lot, it can be a hassle. However, we only left twice- once to go to Cozumel and once to visit Tulum. I highly recommend both trips, but can see why people never leave Esencia! The Rooms Our room was very nice. We stayed in the Menta room, which was an upstairs Garden Suite with an amazing plugepool that looked across the jungle (although you can see some of the monstrous other hotels in the distance). The maid comes once a day to change the sheets and towels and then again for turn down, which I loved! Some of the local creatures (bugs and salamanders) did sneak inside, and normally I am horrified by bugs, but I didn't let it bother me. Somehow it was fitting with the environment. We brought our ipod to hook up to the surround sound system and loved being able to listen to our own music. Also, the beds are heavenly! The Food Food is big at Esencia- since it is pretty much the only place you will eat unless you wan to pay $20 each way for a taxi into Playa del Carmen, which is the closest town. It is on the pricier side, but the quality is excellent. I always get sick in Mexico, usually from the food, and am happy to say that I did not get sick this trip. They start the morning off with complimentary tea or coffee (you tell them what you prefer when you arrive) and pastries. We waged war with the birds to get our pastries, but it was well worth the 7:30 am wake-up. Breakfast was included with our stay, which I also recommend, because it allowed us to pig out guilt free for one meal a day. They also serve complimetary tea and coffee in the main house at 5:00 which we participiated in every day. It allowed us to unwind after a tiresome day at the beach and check our email (its the only internet available on the property). The Beach The beach was incredible during our stay. Some previous posts mention a dirty beach, but I disagree. There are some rocky parts of the beach, but there are also some rock free parts as well. Make sure you ask to borrow some goggles so you can explore the wildlife living in the rocks! The best huts fill up quickly (I preferred the huts that did not have sides because they felt more roomy), so get there early to stake your claim. The Spa We used the steam room and cold jacuzzi every day t the spa (it's free) and loved relaxing in their little meditation area. On our second to last night we got the Him and Hers rituals in the same room and it was heavenly! The ritual was incredible and the prices are pretty reasonable. I recommend doing the morning yoga at least once during your stay. It was the most intense yoga ever because of the weather (hot and humid, even at 9:00 am), but definitely an experience. The Service One of our favorite parts of our stay was the excellent service at Esencia. Everyone knew our names by the second day and were super friendly.

The room's decor is minimal yet warm and luxurious and adheres to their philosophy of stripping down all the ornaments and details and leaving only what's essential to complete relaxation. The grounds are really nice, distances between the rooms and the rest of the buildings on the property are short. Their spa is inspired by the local traditional Mayan culture and comes off authentic- not wannabe at all. They have their own herb garden which they use in their treatments. Fans of organic, all-natural products will be satisfied with the overall philosophy and practices of the spa. The restaurant was good, I give it a B+. The beach is quite nice in the morning. Later in the afternoon the tide brings in natural seaweed. It's not displeasing just perhaps not what you were expecting. The sand is amazing and the color of the ocean is what you came here for. There are 2 pools and various chill out spots. What makes this place stand out is the service. Invisible hands seem to anticipate your every need at precisely the right times. Beach hut service is AMAZING. You are waited on without feeling overwhelmed by being constantly 'bothered'. The staff to guest ratio makes you feel very well pampered in a genuine and personal way. This type of place attracts people who want to lay low and enjoy the surroundings and each other. People respected each other's privacy yet when we did interact with others they were really polite and considerate. The value of the room/resort is very good. A The value of spa is very good. A The value of the restaurant is good. B+ Here I felt that although you'd expect to be overcharged for resort fine dining, the food was high-end for local standards but for a San Franciscan expecting world-class cuisine it was lacking. Wine selection was pretty weak as well. Breakfast picked up the slack and was amazing. try local dishes as they've obviously got these mastered.

Airport collection was on-time and efficiet. The welcome is warm and relaxed, particularly love the ride in the Golf-cart to the resort - really fancy a go at driving that thing! The room was lovely - decked out with roses for our anniversary - with complimentary bottle of wine - nice touch! Had garden suite with plunge pool - agree with previous review - you would never know there was anyone else there - only ocasionally disturbed by Iguanas, Geccos, Basilisks and butterflys. The coffee and breads first thing is a nice touch - great before the complimentary Tai Chi and Yoga, prior to an excellent breakfast - the staff are very accomodating to slightlyeccentric English requests - even off menu. Ceviches are amazing - just watch the \"spicy sauce\" they offer - it is really hot. The pools and beach are impeccably managed - yes there is some debris- but it is a beach and seaweed and shells do get washed up - some plastic cups on the beach further up - but it is a federal beach - not a private beach and it's several kilometres long - they can't clear it all - get angry with the people that drop stuff - not the hotel for not clearing every single last bit up! Dolly got to the Esencia before we did - and damaged one of the pools - maintenance worked all the hours to get it fixed - just as we were leaving - really sorry to have missed the opportunity to try it out. The Margaritas - especially the Golden Margaritas are excellent , water is purified and safe as ice. Copious gratis bottles of water are provided everywhere,the wine list varied and reasonable including both new and old world, the evening meals were excellent - portion sizes can be large. Particularly liked the chef special menus - Regional multi course affairs - with charming explanations from the waiting staff. Opportunity to try stuff I would never have had the nerve or inclination to try without this \"tasting menu\" type thing - really good. Snorkelling trip with Lucas - the Dive Master, was amazing. Boat trip off main beach (where there is some reef) to the main reef - saw stingray, sea turtles (can't be that dirty!) and so many tropical fish I lost count - the personal snorkels in the rooms are a nice touch - and you can borrow masks and visors from the beach attendants. Without doubt the best hotel I have ever stayed in - not the most spectacular room or view - but the most attentive, polite, friendly staff - nothing is too much trouble. The grounds are impeccably maintained and the atmosphere relaxed. The spa is well run and the treatments exceeded expectations. The only downside - the damn mosquitoes - they clear them out every 3 days - but they are a menace - use the complimentary \"Bye-Bye\" repellant - it works, they have it everywhere. The tax and service issue mentioned elsewhere was made quite clear to me when I booked directly with the hotel - it means you don't need to keep money on you for tipping - really liked that.

We had fabulous weather! The hotel is small and beautiful. It is very simply decorated and the grounds perfectly manicured. The bed was extrememly comfortable. We used to say it was like sleeping in a big marshmallow as the bedding was all done in white with great pillows and the softest comforter cover. We had a garden suite on the ground level. I requested an upper level suite but I was happy with the lower after seeing the unit above us. We had a great outside area that the upstairs units do not have. We had a \"solarium\" - a nice size deck made all private with its surrounding garden with a nice size plunge pool, 2 great chaise lounges and an additional outside shower.We were lucky that we were in one of the garden suites closest to the main house. However if I were to book again I would definately spend the extra money and get one of the few ocean view rooms as they would have more air flow through the suite. The garden suites are very tucked in and I missed the ocean breeze and sound of the waves. We both loved the food at Esencia! The breakfasts could be as light - simple juices and fruit plates - or substantial as you preferred. The scrambled egg stuffed poblanos and the Mexican Eggs were deliciou. The ceviche menu at lunch, though expensive - $25 - 30 each - were so refined, fresh, and addiciting. We originally thought we would go for a few dinners away from the resort but fell in love with the food and the ambiance of the El Fuego. We actually ordered appetizers and soups for dinner several nights. The lobster taquitos, stuffed jalapenos, and corn soup were favorites. One evening there was a Mexican Buffet with complimentary Mexican drinks and music. We don't really like buffets but this one was done so well and the waiters asked what you would like and then got your food. I must mention that all the help - the beach attendants, waiters, bartenders, concierge - were extremely and genuinely helpful and attentive. I loved that there were 2 pools - one for adults only and one for children. Both pools were just off the beach so gorgeous views and breezes. There was always ample space at both pools and often we were the only ones taking a dip. We did spend most of our time on the beach on the wonderfully comfortable chaise lounges. Again, ample room for all. We would walk the long beach of Xpuha. Swimming was better south of the hotel near a big resort (don't know its name). Now to the Big Negative: The beach/ocean when looking at it from the distance was beautiful. Turquoise water and rolling waves. However when you walked on the beach some distance or swam it was rather filthy as another poster mentioned. There was all sorts of crap in the water and washed up on the beach. One morning the beach attendant who was raking our beach pulled up a siringe! He shook his head in disgust! I really couldn't enjoy a swim in this water as everytime I tried to take a swim a piece of plastic would wrap around my leg or brush against my body. YUCK! We have not been to this area of Mexico for 12 - 14 years. My husband and I were shocked at the growth. We had been to this beach when nothing but a few private homes were there. It is a shame that the growth of the Mayan Riviera has not developed with a consciousness for the pristine beauty this land once possessed. Environmental issues are not at all important to this land and that is a major turn off and reason for us probably not returning dispite the beauty of this hotel.", "Date": "March 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southampton, New York", "Title": "\u201cToo much garbage on the beach!\u201d", "Author": "Blair2276", "ReviewID": "UR13820817", "Content": "A bit pricey -- watch out for the 15% government tax and 10% surcharge that will be factored onto your hotel bill once you arrive.

The hotel boasts that is located on a two mile stretch of \"pristine\" beach; unfortunately, this is not the case. Esencia keeps the area directly in front of the hotel's pool clean (about 200 feet) but in order to avoid the rocks, you must go to the side of this area to swim. That's where the garbage and filth lies. We spent one afternoon counting the old shoes and water bottles that littered the beach! We brought this to the manager's attention and asked if there was anything that could be done, and he simply shrugged his shoulders. We have stayed at other small hotels (Bucuti in Aruba) and they go so far as to organize volunteer beach clean up mornings and give a bottle of champagne to the participants as incentive. I'm not what you would call an environmentalist, but I was bothered by the garbage and was in fear of stepping on something sharp while in the water.

To give you an idea of the area, Esencia is an hour out of Cancun. There is basically one straight road running along the coastline which is a coastline of hotels. Its not like Cancun where the hotels are on top of each other. The are all by the look of them huge complexes in their own secluded settings including some golf resorts. if you like the larger hotels then there looks to be some fantastic choices however if you like the smaller place with incredible attention to detail where nothing seems to be too much, then Esencia is for you. There are only 29 rooms which are either split level houses or houses in there own grounds with secluded gardens, swimming pools and plunge pools all very private and secluded. You really have to look hard to see the other houses as they are so private. our plunge pool was screened with jungle plants and you really wouldnt know anybody was around you. There is no glitzy entrance at Esencia, its not their style and they are promoting subtlety and seclusion. You are greeted at the Mayan hut, checked in and taken to your accomodation in a golf buggy through the jungle. It is wonderful and beautifully cared for. The path is paved but is in keeping with the jungle surroundings. We were then taken by the manager, Angel, on a low key tour to familiarise us with the resort. The houses are shrouded in exotic trees and plants and plenty of wildlife - nothing that should worry you though! Do expect to see Iguanas, lizards, ghekos, crickets, herons, eagles, amazing other birds, the occasional snake, mozzies but they provide you with eco friendly spray so you dont need to take your own and......well we werent really sure what it was but a cross between a racoon and a monkey that kept stealing our pre breakfast pastries in the morning! It got so excited one morning it pushed thy clay pot off the table at 6am waking up the neighbours with a terrible smash and ran off with my croissant! we waited for him the next morning and caught him on video, excellent memories!

From the hut we were driven via golf-cart down a short trail to a waiting member of the concierge staff ready to take us on a tour of the complex. We visited the spa where they make most everything they use from their organic herb garden, and he also showed us the concierge's office where they have an array of DVD's, board games and also extra sunscreen. Our house had a living room and media room on the bottom floor and two bedrooms with a large terrace overlooking the pool on the top floor. It was decorated very minimally, but wasn't too cold either. The beds were very comfortable, and the bathrooms were clean. The only problem we had with our bathroom was that in the master bathroom the hot water took a while to turn on, but the duel shower heads were very nice when it did. There was a kitchen in our room, but it was closed and could only be used if a private chef came to make our meals in our house for us. Some activities that I would recommend are that at least one night while you are there take a trip into Playa Del Carmen to have dinner. Their fifth avenue has many nice stores and restaurants, and they seem to have a very active night life, if that is what you are interested in. Our family also went on a snorkeling trip in the ocean that you can arrange with the concierge. A boat picked us up right on Esencia's beach and took us out about 500 meters to a reef. We snorkeled out there for about an hour and saw many fish and even a sting ray. The great thing about snorkeling with a private instructor and not a big group is that you have one on one attention if you are in a group of people who are on many different levels, and you can choose how much time you spend out there. We went out with a young man named Lucas who was very polite and kept us all safe and entertained. One final activity that I would recommend is driving to Tulum for a few hours and walk around the ruins that overlook the water, it is a great place to bring your camera. The food was definitely one of the highlights of our trip, and definitely come with an empty stomach, because you will want to try a bit of everybody's. For breakfast we enjoyed the chilequiles and the french toast, and for lunch the ceviche is a must. Dinner was always lovely, and I would recommend the red snapper and the crab salad. We were there for new years eve, and the hotel served us a complementary five course meal by the pool which was exquisite. From the moment you enter Esencia you can tell that service is one of their number one priorities. It seamed like everybody there wanted to make our stay memorable and they received great joy from doing so. All of the waiters are friendly and the people at the concierge desk are helpful. Antonio and Elias were our family's favorite waiters! It may sound like I am exaggerating and gushing, but it is the least that I can say about this hotel.

We have stayed at many wonderful hotels around the world, and this was truly our favorite ever based on service, atmosphere, and, of course, the wonderful beach! We did much research on this site, so we wanted to reciprocate. The dates we were there were Oct 25 - 31, 2007. The Beach First, this is one of the most beautiful beaches we've ever been to. The sand is soft, clean, and cool to the touch, even in the heat. The water is crystal-clear and blue. Fairly shallow for a long while. It was calm most days and even when rougher in other spots along the beach, was more calm along this area due to the peninsula to the left of this particular beach. We did not snorkel much, but there are good spots for it. There is sea grass, but it is in limited areas and you can go swim/float quite a distance without seeing it. No need for shoes in the water. The Hotel It is amazingly beautiful. It is very white, as some have commented. We loved the cleanliness and minimalism of it. I've posted some pictures to show. We were in a garden room, called Romero. It was very private. We never heard anyone the whole time. There was a great area to lay on a daybed and read outside or take in room service. This was contreversial on the postings, but we liked it - 15% is added to everything to cover all gratuities and you never receive or have to wait for a bill at dinner, they put it under your door every couple of days. I think this is partically why the service was always so great. I'll describe a typical day at Esencia to illustrate how wonderful the service is. Between 7 and 8 am, coffee, fresh-squeezed juice, and sweet rolls are delivered to your room. They do not disturb you and leave it outside. As others have said, if you wait, a bird will get to it. However, they do cover the juice, rolls, etc., so this only happened to us one day. Then, you can go have breakfast at the pool area, included in the rate. Breakfast is truly wonderful and very large there. You always get rolls (again, if you want), fruit plate, and mango jelly. You also choose from the menu. Mexican eggs, Frittatas, French toast, etc. Very, very good. Then, when you go back to your room, they have typically cleaned it or in the process of wrapping up cleaning it. We usually headed to the beach at that point. The beach service is the best I've ever had anywhere. They give you snorkeling equipment if you ask. You arrive at the beach. They ask if you'd like shade or sun. They take you to a palapa, if you want shade, as we did. If you are getting too much sun, they will move your chairs, bring umbrellas, whatever you need. They also bring bottled water in an ice bucket for you. You can order drinks, lunch, etc. on the beach and the service is excellent. For lunch, it is very good, and large portions, approx $15 for snacks/tapas and from $18 - $25 for entrees. Throughout your beach day, they will bring wet, towels with ice to use to cool off. I can't emphasize enough how truly friendly and helpful EVERY member of the staff is. They seem to really enjoy making your day perfect. When you go back to your room, there will usually be fresh fruit, wine, or some other little treat. Additionally, as others have said, they stock water (lots of it), a couple Cokes, Diet Cokes, beers, and juices in the fridge, along with ice (all complimentary). There are also plunge pools in the garden rooms that they will heat if you like (watch out, it can get VERY hot). We usually showered or napped and then headed to dinner either on property or went to Playa. The restaurant there is very, very good. Prices are about $8 - $10 for appetizer or salad and about $30 for an entree (approximately). Service there is also excellent. You can eat inside or outside. When you come back to your room, it is usually turned down with a scented oil burning in the room. You can borrow movies to watch on the DVD player. You can exchange books at the main house (or magazines). The iPod in the room is great and loaded with a nice variety of music and piped throughout the bathroom and bedroom. You can also plug your own in. Try to chocolate cake, it is to die for! The Spa My husband did a deep tissue massage and I did the special Earth, Water, Fire (something like that) ritual. Very good, loved the herbs and scents used. The Weather For our week, it was in the mid 80s all week with a great breeze. One night I needed a sweater at dinner. It rained on evening (30 minutes) and one afternoon (1 hour) where we just read on our balcony on the daybed and enjoyed watching the rain. Other Restaurants We ate at Al Cielo next door. Very good. My favorite was the scallops wrapped in bacon in passion fruit. I highly recommend this place. We walked over one evening. Great service too. I think if you were on a budget, this would be a fabulous place to stay (they have 4 rooms). Same gorgeous beach as Esencia. Not the same service and atmosphere, but still very rustic and nice. We ate at Yaxchte, a Mayan restaurant in Playa - very, very good. We at at La Parilla, Mexican in Playa - also very good. We had a beer at a nice little beach bar at Hotel Fusion. The hotel didn't look luxury, but the beach bar was very nice and laid back. Bugs and other annoyances Yes, there are bugs here. It's the jungle. I'm a mosquito magnet and did get 2 or 3 bites. I simply wore bug spray (the one they provided called bye bye and Buzz Away (a natural one I'd brought) and they pretty much left me alone. They are out in the morning, at night, pretty much anytime. So, if you tend to get bit, spray yourself! We didn't have any problems with bugs in the shower or on our fruit as others have talked about. We simply got rid of fruit if it was going bad or put it in baggies (good to bring for lots of reasons). If you haven't been to Playa, I found the sales people a bit annoying, yelling for you to come in and some kind of stalking you in the shops. We still thoroughly enjoyed going there and went 2 days into town. Just say no, gracias a lot. I would recommend this trip to anyone looking for a luxury vacation in a serene, private setting. This would be a fabulous honeymoon spot.

This trip was our 30th anniversary and we considered many options in planning it. Therefore, it's only right that I relate our experiences for others. 60 miles south of the Cancun airport lies the sleepy beach area Xpu-ha. Esencia is without doubt the most hospitable and best staffed resort we've ever stayed at. Better than Casa que Canta in Zihuatenejo and better than Casa de los Sue\u00f1os or Villa Rolandi on Isla Mujeres. Here's what makes Esencia better than the others, including the other two SLH members . The Beach, the personal service, solitude-ambience & rooms in that order. The food is excellent also. We only ate in for dinner one night, and the meal was superb. Their very skilled and friendly chef is from Chile and he takes great pride in his menu. He's a fantastic chef. The beach is narrow (50' wide), deserted, peaceful and kept spotless. No beach hawkers in sight. Ask for a mask and flippers because 100 yards off shore there's a healthy little rock and coral reef in 6 feet of water well worth snorkeling ! Personal snorkels come with the room so there's no sharing necessary. Beach service is without par. Fresh dry towels are constantly being offered and changed out on your beach lounge even if you don't ask. They won't let you move anything by yourself. It's as if they're intuitive. In fact, as I write this, little \"Miguel\" just brought us fresh iced hand towels for our faces, wow ! No plastic cups at the beach, ever. Glass and porcelain, with cloth napkins. BTW, while we were there they were rebuilding the timber and cheesecloth palapas and replaceing them with palm thatch roof ones. Also, one of the pools was also being resurfaced . Don't worry, there's never any construction noise permitted and there was never anyone in the other pool anyway. The breakfast and lunch staff is equally skilled and attentive, but not overly so. Before breakfast, at 7:00 am promptly ,coffee and rolls arrive at your terrace. The ipod full of music they issue you has a wide variety of music and plugs into an amp in the room for a nice touch. They supplied me with earbuds for beach use upon request. The shower stalls are open air which is typically Mexican and they have dbl. heads. I especially liked the overhead pancake rainhead. My wife did the \"full tilt\" spa session. Called Earth, wind & fire or something like that. She love it ! I chartered a scuba resort dive through the concierge. Diego, their Argentinean dive master was the best I've ever used anywhere, period ! Is Esencia perfect ? No. One very small item, out of their hands is the road noise from the newly expanded highway 307. Usually it cannot be heard from the beach. Some of the garden view rooms, especially those closest to the highway (like ours) can occasionally hear the din. My solution was to keep my room fan and AC cranked at night and then I couldn't hear it. Or, I had the ipod going. It really made a difference which way the wind was blowing as well . That's the ONLY negative thing I can find and it's VERY minor. See how spoiled they make you after only 1 week ? Will we return ? Absolutely ! We can't wait.

I cannot say enough about how amazing Esencia was. We enjoy staying at several different properties during our vacations and this was the first of three and by far, the best. We enjoy staying at small hotels versus large properties. I've stayed at several other of the small luxury hotel properties (I forget the web address) and would compare it to the other favorite - Hotel Hana in Maui. From the moment you arrive, the service is terrific. We were escorted to our room (one of the garden suites outside of the main house) and given a tour of the property. Our room was minimal but perfect - all decor white, extremely comfortable bed, beautiful bathtub - large enough for two (plus an outdoor cool tub and outdoor shower), flat panel tv, great ammenities like Molton Brown products and bug spray (thank you!). To be honest, my only complaint is that the shower (in its own room) has slats on the bottom allowing for a bit of a buggy problem. I have to say that I am terrified of bugs - a bit of a wimp admittedly, most people will not care at all. Definitely use the bug spray provided and if you afraid of bugs at the bottom of the shower - just wear the flip-flops so nicely provided. We were lucky enough to visit during off-season and felt like we had the entire property to ourselves practically. Although I think even when it is booked to capacity, it will not feel like it. The sense of privacy is amazing. The pools were absolutely stunning. The restuarant is decent - standard hotel food. We walked up the beach to a few of the surrounding properties. There is an excellent little cafe (believe the owner may have been German if I recall correctly) and it was good food, great atmosphere, a nice change from hotel food. The service was excellent in the Esencia restaurant just thought the food could use a little flavor. **You should note that breakfast is included with your rate. We were under the impression that it was just the coffee left at your door - no, be sure to go and get breakfast - it is included. They should be more clear on this.

I'll break it down so it will be easier to follow.... Arrival- after an hour and 15min. car ride from the cancun airport, we came to Esencia.....when you drive up you have no idea where this hotel is located as there is no welcome sign and then you take a drive down a bumpy unpaved road going thorugh the jungle- the mystery of this location was exciting in itself. once you reach a thatched roof buiding you realize you are here, but have no idea what to expect next. we were welcomed warmly and made to feel right at home. Monica and Emily gave us a tour of the property and we were just amazed, it is surrounded by lush gardens and felt very secluded and romantic. The Hotel Room- there are two choices when booking at Esencia, The main House or The Garden view rooms. I would think either would be nice, but because we wanted an oceanview we chose the main house, our room was called Las Terraces and it was well appointed, great view of the ocean and pools. Very simple furnishings but an elegant feel and the most comfortable bed with very high quality linens. Our room was quite large with another room that had a shower(double rain shower heads) and toilet and then a space with double sinks as well. We had a great flat screen tv and loved the Ipod hook ups as well. When we got to our room there was also a nice bottle of wine and a fruit basket that was replenished on a daily basis. The Food-Every morning we had a tray placed outside of our door with coffee and tea, when you arrive they ask you what you like in the morning and there it is waiting for you when you get up, we would have our drinks early and then by 10am we would be ready for breakfast. You also get a full breakfast and there is a choice of anything you could want American or Mexican, we loved the French Toast!! The restaurant offers food all day and can be served at the beach as well, we did not have one bad meal while we were there- the food is excellent. Beach-We have traveled to many islands and other resorts in Mexico, but we felt that this was the most beautiful beach ever. The water is turquoise Blue, the sand soft and white and there are times when you feel like the only one there!! Special Services- We booked the Essence of Love Package so that we had some things included and I thought it was well worth it. With that we had transfers from the airport, a couples massage that was an experience in itself- highly suggested!! a romantic dinner for two which we had on the beach one night and a picnic lunch which we took with us on a snorkeling trip one day. Playa Del Carmen-We decided as much as we loved being at Esencia, we also wanted to get out and explore the near by town a couple of nights for some local culture and dining. We felt it was worth the $30.00 round trip cab ride!! We shopped and ate at a couple of really good restaurants. Then when we came back to Esencia we felt we were back in our own little cozy hideaway. Overall- The staff and hotel are amazing, we felt special each day when we were greeted by first name and as good as the service was, we never felt like it was overwhelming. Esencia holds a very special place in our hearts, we suggest it for couples looking for a romantic holiday or a celebration of some kind. Although there were some children that looked like they were having fun, it seems to be more of a quiet calm place that you go to just get away from it all.

The high level summary is that we really enjoyed Esencia and would enthusiastically recommend it for travelers in search of a one-off property with unique rooms, great beach, lovely grounds and pleasant staff. We first looked at Esencia online and picked it from other area hotels like Deseo and Ikal del Mar. The main driver was the fact that Esencia seemed to have the best beach (it certainly did not disappoint in this regard). We looked online at room prices and then called them directly to see if we could get a deal. At first they quoted us the same price as online, but then when I asked if there was anything they could do like include a spa package, they said they would call us back. When they did, they quoted a package that was significantly less than originally quoted, plus inlcuded 4 spa treatments, daily breakfast and round trip transportation from Cancun. So it seemed like calling the hotel directly was worth it. When we arrived at the Cancun airport we had a little trouble finding our driver, as the sign the service held was very small and in a sea of other drivers. As soon as some of the others figure you are lost, they descend upon you to try to sell their services. Finally we found the person holding our sign, and he called the driver who came in about five minutes in a nondescript minivan. Esencia clearly outsources this, as our driver (who was friendly) was making his first trip to the hotel. We arrived about 6:30PM and were met at the reception area near the front gate. A pleasant American woman gave us a tour of the grounds and walked us to our room, the Rosa suite in the main house. We were pleasantly surprised by the size of the terrace of this suite, which overlooked the pool and ocean beyond. In general Esencia is made up of several white buildings with Spanish roof tiles. The look feels almost like something you would see in Morrocco or Sanrtorini and is very minimalist, yet comfortable. Our room had a large comfortable king size bed, daybed by the window, desk, bathroom with double sink, walk in closet, huge two head shower and soaking tub. Some others have commented on ants. We did see very, very tiny ants in the closet. These were plentiful but somehow did not really seem like a nuisance; just be sure to give your clothes a shake before putting them on. We also saw a small gekko in our room on several occasions. He was easily frightened when approached. I really like the fact that you can plug your iPod into the in wall sound system. Keep in mind that this won't charge your iPod, so best advised to bring a power source. At check in and periodically during our stay they bring a huge fruit basket to the room. The fridge is always stocked with two beers and a handful of cokes, water and juices - nice touch. I would rate this room on par with other high end hotels we have stayed at, like Post Ranch or Korakia. As others have commented, the restaurant on the property is pretty much your only dinner option. We liked the fact that you can sit outside. For our first meal, we each ordered an appetizer and main course. This proved to be WAY too much food, as their portions are huge! For subsequent dinners we sometimes ordered just two appetizers, or split an entree with an appetizer. At first we thought the food was just okay, but after several meals (and especially compared with restaurants in Playa del Carmen) the food is very good. We liked the crepes, the sopecitos and lobster taquitos as appetizers. Both soups (lime and corn) are excellent and must haves. For entrees we liked the beef filet, lamb (TWO racks on the plate) and seafood risotto. The coconut pie was the best dessert. At lunch we had the ceviches, which are excellent. Again, one is perfect for splitting between two people. The guacamole and chips and salsa were too good to resist. It would have been nice for them to serve the lunch menu at dinner just to mix it up a bit. While they don't advertise this, another couple told us they ordered hamburgers in their room one night for dinner. The breakfast menu is quite extensive; everything from granola to pancakes to Yucatecan specialties. The Huevos con chorizo, epazotes and machacdo are all worth trying. The breakfast menu has prices listed on it. I found this strange as everyone we talked to was on a package that had breakfast included. They do bring you coffee and rolls to your room in the morning (although they missed us the first day). As others have commented, if you don't fetch these quickly the birds and ants will have their way with them. It's funny that this still persists, as it seems like a cheap food cover would solve the problem. The beach at Esencia is great for sunning. The sand is very soft and powdery. There are 11 little beach palapas with two chaises in them. Even if you don't get there early enough to snag one, the staff will gladly bring two chaises down from the pool to set wherever you'd like. We actually preferred being out in the sun and closer to the water. The beach is crescent shaped and about a mile long. To the left of Esencia is a short stretch of deserted beach that leads to the Xpuha Palace, a resort that has been vacant since Wilma. To the right is a longer stretch where you pass some all inclusive resorts. Immediately next to Esencia is Al Cielo, which is a restaurant with four hotel rooms and some beach palapas. I found XpuHa beach to be more populated than I expected. Esencia however enjoys its location at one end of the beach, so you really didn't get much traffic in front of the property. Typically when you did, the people looked at Esencia as if to say \"I wish I were staying there!\". The beach staff is super friendly, especially Julio, who seems to be the major-domo of the staff. They come by with bottled water and cool towels, and will bring you margaritas (try the Kiwi margs) from the bar without making you feel like you are being harrassed. They were so helpful we felt it appropriate to give them an additional gratuity at the end of our stay. The beach itself has some coral right in front if it, so if you are looking for a sandy swimming beach this really isn't it. The snorkeling right in front of the hotel is not great, but there is good stuff nearby. We took the complimentary 9AM yoga class most days. There was a great female teacher for a few of the days (forget her name) and one male teacher who was not so good. I did not take any of the spa treatments (except for a steam) but I have it on good authority that they are excellent, particularly the earth water fire and air massage. We did the temezcal (sweat lodge) one night. While it was a good experience and we liked our guide Eliu, it wasn't the mind bending experience I was hoping for. The swim right after felt great. To sum up, we really liked Esencia and would go back, if we didn't have so many other places to visit first. We were a little nervous that it wasn't going to live up to our expectations, but it more than did. If you are looking for a unique, beautfully landscaped hotel with a great beach and interesting architecture, you won't be disappointed.", "Date": "March 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cEsencia - a great place to relax\u201d", "Author": "peterm1", "ReviewID": "UR7154817", "Content": "I would echo many of the positive reviews posted here. My wife and I just returned from a seven night stay at the Esencia. When you arrive (after an hour car trip from Cancun airport), you are greeted at a traditional Mayan hut, and then taken by bicycle cart down a long winding path to the hotel (the path reminded me of Survivor at night with all of the lit torches lining the way). We were greeted by Monica and Nicholas (who are both extremely friendly), and Nicholas gave us a short tour of the property. THE ROOM: We stayed in a garden room suite on the bottom floor. While we did not have a view, I didn't mind looking out into the jungle, since the property was maintained meticulously. We had a plunge pool (and outdoor shower), which was quite warm and I enjoyed sitting in it at the end of a day. I won't repeat the description of the rooms in detail that other people have posted, since I think they all have similar amenities, which are modern and luxurious. The bed was very comfortable and large, and it was great being able to plug our Ipod in and have music playing in the bedroom and bathroom. I also liked the refrigerator with free water, soda and beer all week. We watched a few movies on our large TV, and they have a selection of DVDs in the main office (no rental charge). They also have a small selection of used books and magazines in the main house in one of the side rooms, and I would suggest that they let guests know about this and perhaps suggest that people may wish to leave books they are finished with (we left ours). It would be nice if they subscribed to some magazines that people could borrow (just about all of the magazines I saw were foreign fashion magazines). Back to the room. I was concerned about bugs since I really don't like them and had read one review that concerned me. However, it was not a problem. There were some tiny ants that came into our bathroom one day and they quickly sprayed them which put an end to the problem, and if you leave any food out you will probably get ants so keep food packed or in the fridge. Also, one day I woke up and found what looked like a very small scorpion by the bed on the floor just sitting there, and quickly put a bowl over it and they came and removed it. I was told it was not a poisonous type of bug and I didn't really worry about it (I got the sense they were surprised it was there and I never heard anyone else mention anything about seeing scorpions). After all, the room is in the jungle and I think it would be impossible to keep all bugs out all the time unless the place was hermetically sealed. Believe me, I can't stand bugs, so unless you are totally phobic about bugs, I wouldn't let this keep you from going there. We also saw a Tapir outside eating some fruit, which was interesting. Two other things my wife noticed - she said she smelled a sewage smell in the bathroom sometimes, although I didn't notice it (she has a very good sense of smell). She also noticed that the chambermaid would leave our door unlocked when she straightened up our room in the evenings. I wasn't concerned about security at all when I was there, but I did keep valuables in the in-room safe just in case. It was only about a 30 second walk to the restaurant and main house and a minute walk to the beach so the location was great (the property isn't huge so it's easy to walk around). We would usually wake up early in the morning from birds calling in the nearby trees, which I didn't mind since I liked getting up fairly early. SERVICE: The best we have ever experienced. The best thing in my mind about the Esencia is the service - never have we met such friendly staff at a hotel. They aren't intrusive, but are happy to talk if you want to and are always there to help out with anything you need. We thought Elias and Fidel at the restaurant, and the person at the beach area with the hat (I forget his name) were especially nice, but everyone was great. FOOD: Expensive but tasty I loved having tea and coffee dropped off automatically every morning on our patio so I could relax in my PJs in private with my coffee and pastries. The larger breakfast by the pool area was also excellent, especially the huevos con chorizo (eggs with sausage) and french toast. I would also ask for \"liquados\" or smoothies and they were happy to make them (these meals were included in our rate). The lunch menu was also very good, and my wife loved the shrimp ceviche. We had dinner there on three nights, and it was always very good and the setting was nice, although it would have been nice if they changed the menu some nights during the week (they did have daily specials). The last night we were there, they had a special barbeque dinner with free mojitos and margaritas on the beach around a campfire, with an excellent mariachi band. They served an amazing Tres Leches cake for dessert too. For a little variety we ate once next door at Al Cielo (you have to make reservations in advance and the food was good but not great), and we went into Playa del Carmen and ate at Ula Gula (an excellent Italian restuarant) and Babe's Noodle House (which has good, cheap Thai food and large drinks). A taxi into Playa cost about $16 on average. The hotel can give you a list of recommended restaurants in Playa too. One suggestion I have is to also automatically give each guest a list of tours and activities - I saw that someone had a binder with such materials from the hotel and assume you can get one by asking but it would have been nice to have one in the room already. One suggestion I would make is to keep the bar at the pool area open in the evening and play some music - it would have been nice to hang out there either before or after dinner. BEACH: Just about perfect. Esencia sits on the north end of X-PU HA beach, and it's nearly deserted except for a few people who walk up this far for a stroll. The sand is soft, and the water very clear and warm. If you walk about 100 yards to the left or right, there will be large sandy areas to swim around in (the reef comes in closer to the shore in front of the hotel). I went snorkeling just north of the hotel and saw a sea turtle and some fish, which was fun (I went on a snorkeling tour later in the week and the visibility was better near the Esencia than the lagoons I went to). One day I arranged for a snorkeling tour with Lucas through the hotel. Since it turned out to be cloudy and cool the morning we were supposed to go, the hotel rescheduled it for the next morning. There must have been some kind of mix-up since the next morning when we went to meet Lucas he said he was not called by the hotel to reschedule the tour, so we couldn't go that day since he was taking some divers out (it turned out to be fine with us anyway since we didn't mind relaxing on the beach). I think the hotel may have confused us with the divers. They have very comfortable lounge chairs under palapas, and if they are all taken they will bring out more chairs and an umbrella for you. Some people came out early to reserve seats by putting their stuff on them, but by early I mean 9 or 10am, not 5am like at some places, and again it's not an issue since they will bring more chairs and umbrellas onto the beach if you want. There are also a lot of empty chairs by both pools - I never saw more than a handful of people hanging out at the pools even though they were very nice (one pool that was heated by the bar was for kids and families and the other was adults only and was cool). Next to the hotel on the beach is Al Cielo, which is beautiful although rustic. Further south are some all-inclusives and some bars and restaurants like Cafe del Mar (not bad for a sandwich for lunch). It's more crowded and dirty there, so I only went there for a long walk or a snack. The X-PU HA Palace hotel is to the north of Esencia, but it is on the next bay over so it does not sit on the same beach as Esencia and we never saw anyone from there. OTHER NICE THINGS: The hotel has a laptop we borrowed to check our emails - there is a wireless network in the main house area. It's free and easy to do. I liked how you don't need any cash at all - they automatically add a 15% service charge for food and drinks so we didn't need to worry about tips (we just left them on our pillow for the chambermaid). You never need to sign a check at meals or for drinks either - they ask your name and just add it to your hotel bill (after a day or two the staff knows your name and don't have to ask anymore). I asked for our bill every few days just to check it and there were no discrepancies (although they don't itemize the food or drinks you have - it will just say \"restaurant\" and then the date). We had to send out some t-shirts and underwear for laundry one day since we ran out, and were pleased to discover the charge was very reasonable, unlike at some hotels. We also liked the free yoga lessons given at the main house at 9am. They have free yoga (and sometimes Tai-Chi) lessons there every morning, which is a great service. They also have a free tea service at the main house at 5pm, which was also very nice. Overall, we had a great trip and I would definitely stay there again. I liked the location, too, since you could go to Playa without much trouble, and a lot of other attractions were close to the hotel, such as several cenotes to swim in across the street (we went to Azul - very nice), and Xcaret and Tulum were not too far away by car (we took a great tour called Tulum and Beyond, at www.playa.info). If you need to be closer to the action, or like to have a lot of people around, I would check out Playa, but if you want relaxtion, luxury, privacy and no hassles, Esencia is highly recommended. One final tip: if you want to stay here, join the Club at SLH.com (it's free), and you will be entitled to a few extra freebies such as appetizers and some cocktails, as well as a free room upgrade if it's available (all the rooms were booked when we went so we didn't get an upgrade).", "Date": "March 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201ca wonderful hotel\u201d", "Author": "EmmaNate", "ReviewID": "UR6829348", "Content": "My husband and I spent 5 nights 28. Jan.-2. Feb. at this lovely boutique hotel. We found the hotel on the Small Luxury Hotels website, but booked through their Houston office because SLH told us they were fully booked during the time we requested.That was lucky for us since the hotel itself offered a better package than SHL. The hotel offered a fine package, including a bottle of wine and a fruit bowl served in our room when we arrived, one complimentary evening dinner in the restaurant with our choice of anything on the menu accompanied by a bottle of good champagne, a couple's massage for 2 in the tranquil Mayan-themed spa, an ocean-view room (ours was in the ground floor in the \"guest house\"- it was fantastic with its unique architecture, 2 full bathrooms, large patio overlooking the grassy lawn and sea with a hammock and daybed), a picnic lunch and full breakfast every day, preceded by a \"pre-breakfast\" of sweet rolls and beverage of choice served on your patio . This was in addition to the hotel's keeping the refrigerator stocked with bottled water and soft drinks of your choice, as well as offering the same 2 items on the beach and by the pool at the guest's request - all complimentary. From the moment we were greeted by the hotel's driver at the airport and whisked away to the resort in a comfortable car to our arrival at the hotel's Mayan house at the entrance, everything was done to make our brief holiday at Escencia an enchanting experience. The hotel grounds are beautiful, like being in a mini-rainforest, and they lead to expanses of green lawn and palm trees leading to 2 large swimmming pool and a beach-side restaurant , which border on a crescent of white sand and turquoise water. On the beach are a sufficient number of Mayan-type palapas enclosing 2 comfortable lounges protected from the sun by sheer gauze curtains on 3 sides. Beach & pool attendants are constantly offering water, cool towels and drinks. The hotel assisted us in renting a car for 2 days, so we could make the easy trips to the ruins at Tulum and Playa del Carmen. The food at the restaurant was so good that we ate there every night, unusual for my husband who normally likes to eat any place but at a hotel. The folks at the hotel will assist guests in making reservations at other restaurants, though, and there is a restaurant at the small hotel next door. My husband and I are retired, and we enjoyed the mix of guests which included young & middle-aged couples, as well as 2 families with small children. The atmosphere is unpretentious and quietly elegant. The management and staff are friendly and helpful and always willing to do anything to make their guests' stays comfortable and enjoyable. We like to snorkel, and to our happy surprise, we found there is really good snorkeling right off the beach of the hotel. The sandy bottom in the water off the beach makes it very easy to swim too. There is no real \"happy hour\" or night-life scene at Esencia. By 10:30 guests have usually left the restaurant, and all is quiet. If one wants night-time entertainment, it can be found in Playa del Carmen which is a short drive away. We usually had a drink or 2 delivered to our room after dinner, and played cards on our patio while enjoying the sound of the surf and the starry sky. The manager of the hotel is always around, and she spends time with the guests, eager to hear comments and suggestions. The management staff and the waiters get to know the guests by name; guests feel as though they are welcome houseguests, not anonymous hotel patrons. All daytime meals and snacks (including tea time) can be enjoyed at many places on the property, and guests never have to \"sign\" for anything. We have lived in many countries and cities around the world and visited many more, and we found the Esencia to be one of the best tropical/beach hotels ever, in its location, service, rooms, public areas, food, Mayan atmosphere, amenities, and especially its attitude. You will find casual modern elegance with a tropical twist at Esencia.

Having stayed at such well regarded carribean resorts as malliouhana in anguilla and le toiny in st barth's (as well as numerous four seasons, aman, and relais & chateau properties around the world), we arrived with high expectations and a quick need for relaxation. The staff of Esencia wasted no time in fulfilling our needs. Upon arrival in our beautiful room in le torre, high atop what is rumored to be an italian duchesses' house, two of the obligating staff uncorked a bottle of argentinian malbec, showed us how to turn on the esencia playlist on our room's ipod, and walked us through our complimentary mini bar. After they left, we celebrated our arrival with incomparable views of what may be the best beach in the riviera maya and incomparably well manicured grounds, to surround-sound latin tunes and the best love songs from bollywoood. We have a soft spot for regional cuisine, and when our lime soup, handmade corn tortillas, and duck mole arrived at dinner, we understood why the hotel's chilean chef had been written up in several noteworthy food oriented publications on both sides of the atlantic. Other reviewers who have commented that the nightlife here is subdued may have missed the small spirited after dinner scene out on the terrasse. Here, against the backdrop of torches and stars, staff members run to get the tres leches cake you forgot to order at the restaurant while you chat with the hotel's gracious general manager, or another guest from the U.S. or europe. Conversation invariably turned to the oh, so glamorous female movie star who was among the guests this weekend, but the staff would quickly point out (before asking if the tequilla in the margarita was just right) that this happens often, and all their guests deserve star treatment.

We thought the suite was great. Breakfast served on the deck in the morning, a fridge stocked w/ water and beer each day. The room had a really comfortable bed, a sound system hooked to your own personal ipod, a flat screen TV and a large, well-appointed bathroom.

The wine list is fine but most of the selections are not available. The restaurant is also quite expensive and its the only one on the property.

Upon checking in, I looked out the doors, across the lawn, through some bushes, over the pool, through another set of bushes, and was able to glimpse the ocean - looking to the right of the outdoor massage station directly in front of our room. This to me, is not ocean view - the most important aspect of booking our room. In addition, the view from the bay window (along the side) looked out upon bushes and a chain-link fence that was attempting to cover the vacant lot next door.The rest of our room was large with a simple elegance. Bathroom was fine, nothing fancy, but the amenities were poor. Our room included a flat screen t.v. but we never turned it on and an IPOD stereo set up. Our patio was very spacious with a chase, built-in sofa, table and chairs, and hammock. Coffee was provided every morning on our patio without disturbing us. Grounds: The grounds were extremely well kept and beautiful but the size of the property is not as described. There is a small hotel directly abutting the west side and an empty lot with a lot of local foot traffic within 10 feet of the other side of the main house where our room was. Away from the beach is a lush and well-laid out garden setting. Beach: Beautiful! The beach is kept clean and there is a very gradual slope into the water. Seaweed in spots but not intrusive to swimming. The lounge chairs are comfy and secluded in cabana style structures to allow for a little privacy. The best beach service we have ever received! Staff set up the chairs of our choice and made regular rounds to check on us, offering buckets of ice with water and iced towels for freshening. Towels were plentiful and a staff person was always standing on call for anything one might need. The lack of any form of toys was the only drawback. Kayaks, kick boards, windsurfing boards, all enjoyed by the other resorts, were not available. If there was a beach activity person we never encountered him. We did see some people snorkeling but it did not appear to be the best place for it. Foot traffic was not as imposing as one might expect from the larger resorts, even though the beach is only about 1 mile long. We did not see a single cruise ship nor do they dock in the vicinity. Nothing ruins an ocean view like one of those monstrosities! Noise: Beyond the empty lot must be a gigantic hotel. Throughout the day from our patio we were subjected to voices coming over a bull horn or a selection of bad music. One can also actually hear road noise from the patio and the occasional siren. This particular room is a short distance from the reception area and the stucco lends to magnified acoustics. Bugs: I have traveled the tropics extensively and am well aware that with it comes bugs. BUT, after having my suitcase open for a few hours I found it to be completely infested with these small insects. Throughout the week there were swarms of them throughout the room. A nice fruit basket was awaiting us upon our arrival, but by morning it was so covered with ants that the fruit was no longer identifiable. Of course the ants continued in a long line from the door, to the fruit, and continued their march throughout the room. I had our room fumigated 3 times and finally gave up. I took to spraying them with the insecticide provided for personal use just to keep them under control. Staff: The general staff was extremely friendly, efficient, and quick to meet our needs. The management staff was a complete disaster. Upon arrival, I informed them (not one of the management staff ever offered their names, whereas the general staff did) that we wanted a room with an ocean view as we had booked. She said she would look into what was available and get back to us. We also wanted to know if we could have a coffee maker for our room. 8pm we checked back about the room, unwilling to unpack in case we were able to move. Another person was on duty and we were told that we would be informed first thing in the morning. The coffee maker was a mystery but He would look in to it. 9am no news so I went to the office to find that He (different He) was just looking into it. Request for coffee maker made again. 12pm checked back to find completely different staff and made requests again. 3pm (still haven't unpacked) the manager (another one) will get back to us. FINALLY at 8pm we meet with the manager (yet another one!) to be told that there is a wedding party and it would be too inconvenient to switch (even though they had not arrived yet) and they had no coffee maker but would send a pot of coffee to our room 3 times a day but that never happened. I also just wanted to know if the gym at the Copa was available to us for a fee. It took days to get the answer: yes, for $45 per person. I have never seen such a management team! No communication and always changing. Very frustrating! Even a negative response to our requests would have been preferable to leaving us hanging. (To their credit, on the third day they did provide us with a water pot with a heating element so that we were able to make our own coffee. I also requested non-fat milk for the fridg. in our room and that was provided quickly and at no extra charge.) Water: This is one of the few places that provides its guests with plenty of water without an extra charge! It may sound trivial, but in a hot climate and being ones that do not drink alcohol or soda, this was a very nice amenity that can often times add up $$$ quickly. The refrigerator was also stocked daily instead of the arrival beverages that are never replaced without a fee at other resorts. Food and Restaurant: We are not big eaters so this is not a priority for us. The food was extremely well presented if a little bland or too salty. The breakfast was very nice! We don't normally eat breakfast but throughly enjoyed it every day. The french toast is a must-have! The menu did not change during our 5 nights but a special was offered each evening that did vary. We did not each lunch. Service for dinner was exceptional. The dress code is not noted in the website and upon arrival we were informed it is \"casual chic\". I did not bring appropriate attire as I was told that is was casual before arriving. (I live in Oregon - we take \"casual\" seriously.) Though I felt under dressed there were those more so than I. The evenings in January were far chillier than expected so a shawl or sweater is a must have. I only brought an REI jacket and felt quite silly. Room service: Hmmm. Yes, room service is available 24 hours a day if you don't mind paying $5 PLUS 20% of the bill Plus the gratuity of 15% added to every meal beyond the cost of the food. Pastry bites are provided every morning delivered to the room. Literally three bites for two along with coffee - a little skimpy and you must eat it right away or it becomes ant-infested quite quickly. Tea is a formal affair at 5pm. 3pm would be more appropriate but cookies are included with a nice selection of tea. Spa: I only had one service, an aloe massage. 50 minutes for $110 and it was well done in a lovely setting. (This is more reasonable than many places I have visited.) One could also have the massage in-room for a minimal $5(?) fee. Fruit and flowered water (surprisingly yummy) were offered afterward. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. The lack of physical activity options is maddening for the person who needs daily exercise. They do offer yoga and tai chi every morning at 9am. I was impressed with the level of skill and the setting was lovely. Usually only one or two people other than myself. I dislike using gyms and would prefer outdoor exercise but because there are no water sports or bikes (no room to ride anyway) a gym would have been a huge benefit. A little sundry shop would be a nice addition for postcards or gift items. The rooms lack the typical postcards and resort info that provides one with an introduction and some familiarity with what is around and available. I would have liked to have learned the story behind the Duchess who previously owned the house and its history. The drive from Cancun airport to the resort took 1 hour and 15 minutes. Overall, the resort needs some fine tuning and additional activities. If going for the beach, make sure you are really getting an ocean view room, but one can't help but be pleased with the beach itself.
