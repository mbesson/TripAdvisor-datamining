Firstly the positives,the hotel is very stunning and the grounds immaculate. I liked the whole boardwalk effect,although I found the dining options quite limited. The Disney transport works quite well,although we often found it better to get off at the Swan and walk back as we always seemed to be the last stop. Enjoyed the extra magic hours access,although the parks were not too crowded so this was not an essential perk at this time. Beds were also fantastic. Now the negatives, from when we arrived, no one bothered to assist with our luggage or greet us in any way. The check in staff could not have been more disinterested. Hardly engaging or friendly at all and not a great start to our stay. I also found the rooms to be very noisy. The walls are paper thin to the point you can hear a normal conversation next door. Also the plumbing is very noisy. While its a nice hotel, I really found it lacking,considering what they charge. Is it value for money? No. Would I recommend?

The lobby d\u00e9cor / ambience / atmosphere is out of a fairy tale and the boardwalk itself is a great replica of the East Coast shore. Our trip was during spring break and with two kids (ages nine and eight). During this trip we stayed at a Universal Studios property (Loews Royal Pacific) and the Disney experience is far superior: absolutely will return to Disney and not likely to return to Universal/Loews. Positives: Location is ideal with a short walk to Epcot, boat to Hollywood Studios and prompt bus service to rest of WDW (buses seem to be more frequent than those at less expensive Disney resorts). It is easy to be at any of the parks at opening, return to the pool without wasting time on a bus or in a car, clean up before dinner, and quickly get to some of the nicer restaurants in the area (Flying Fish is by far one of the best fish restaurants in WDW). Service standards are always the among highest in the hospitality industry. At arrival, a cast member greeted the children by name and escorted us to a seating area in the lobby (**use on-line check-in**). While seated on a couch (no line/no waiting), the cast member gave us a folder with room keys, assorted maps and other information about the boardwalk area. The cast member entertained our kids while a concierge assisted us with ticket concerns. Since the ticket concerns took several minutes to resolve, the concierge gave us a pass to skip to the front of the line at any ride and apologized repeatedly for the inconvenience. Always communicate concerns/problems. Amusements for younger kids include a good pool (small water slide the kids love) and entertainers on the boardwalk (juggling, card tricks, etc) provide a great alternative to the parks after running hard all day. Extra Magic Hours. Disney hotel guests are admitted to the parks an hour before the general public. During the busy seasons, it's the difference between accomplishing everything you want in a park during one day or having to return a second day because most of your time is spent waiting in lines. Negatives: No kid's club (Beach Club resort is across the lake, just a nice, and has a kids club). Rooms showing signs of age. Rooms are not as spacious as a 5-star hotel but lay out is functional, bed/couch is comfortable, and very clean (even in bathroom corners and grout). That being said, the volume of guests is taking its toll on woodwork/doors and will need more than just fresh paint in the near future. In short, Disney has calculated the cost of happiness and it is expensive (I would not spend $500/night to go to WDW at any resort). If you do your homework, plan everything in advance, and make the most of every minute, it will be worth it. Having averaged a week at a Disney resort every other year for the past ten years, our experience has been consistently favorable with any issues (inevitable at a 500-room hotel) dealt with quickly and favorably.", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cTERRIBLE Customer Service\u201d", "Author": "headnerd", "ReviewID": "UR128425348", "Content": "Stayed at the Boardwalk as a Disney Vacation Club (DVC) member on points. We have stayed at this resort on a couple other occasions and had problems on one occasion with a smelly carpet in the room. We requested a room change and had to schlep our own luggage to the new room. There was no offer to come get it for us or to bring the keys - we had to return to the front desk. This time was worse. After an electrical problem in the bathroom was not fixed for over 5 hours we were switched to another room but again had to move ourselves with no help from the staff, no compensation for our inconvenience other than a late checkout (2 hours - it was our last night). My wife even had to go to the front desk to talk to the managers. They would not come to our room, and this is a LARGE hotel, so it was quite a walk to the lobby. They said that all they could do for us was the late checkout because we were staying on DVC points. I guess if we had been regular hotel guest they could have done something for us, but I can't imagine why that would make a difference.

The hotel itself is lovely w/ all the victorian touches, the pastel colors & overstuffed furniture made it a great place to come \"home\" to after a long day at the parks. We were there for Easter Week and were very surprised at how quiet the hotel was. We had a standard view room overlooking a very pretty courtyard w/ lots of pretty flowers blooming. The room was very clean & quite a good size (we were just 2 people-my husband & myself). We enjoyed the BelleVue lounge most evenings as well too, it's a great place to kick back & have a drink either before or after dinner. In addition to the lounge the BelleVue also has a nice balcony that you can sit out on-we did that several nights & even caught a glimpse of fireworks one night-Wishes at the Magic Kingdom maybe? This was our second stay at the Boardwalk & the transportation options cannot be beat-it's a 5 minute stroll into the International Gateway at Epcot & a 10 minute walk along the river to Hollywood Studios-there is a boat to both parks as well but we chose to walk instead. We even walked thru Epcot & took the monorail to the Magic Kingdom, the Polynesian & Grand Floridian as well. The restaurants on the Boardwalk are great as well, The Flying Fish is our favorite restaurant anywhere & the boardwalk atmosphere is really fun. The only downside (& it's a minor one!) is that The Boardwalk Inn doesn't have a counter service restaurant. That's fine for lunch & dinner but sometimes you want something more for breakfast than the fare at the Bakery & we find the breakfast at Kouzzina's (sit down restaurant) leaves a bit to be desired-how can you mess up scrambled eggs??)

We have 3 children so our accomodation choices are limited at Disney. We stayed once again in the Deluxe Club Level room and once agian it was awesome. First, the Club Level is the only way to go with 3 or more kids. the breakfast selection this year was even better than last year. The Deluxe room is massive with 2 televisions so one can watch toddler shows and another can watch bigger kid shows. The Lounge is usually playing news in the am and the Disney channel in the pm, so if one of the kids just needs a break form their siblings it is a great place to relax. The pool is by far one of the reasons we will probalby never book at another Disney hotel. Last winter the slide was closed for refurbishment, but this winter my kids were on the slide non-stop from the moment we got to the pool until the moment we left. Even my husband and I enjoyed it a few times. The Boardwalk is definitely the place to be in the evening. Our kids love to just walk around and watch the acts, even if they have seen them before, they are all really entertaining. They love to play the carnival games, you pretty much always win a prize which adds to the magic. There is agreat big lawn in front of the balcony and my son ran around with several other boys one night just kicking the ball he'd just won. The proximity to Epcot and HS is also a huge plus. You can be at HS in 10 minutes on the boat (we usually get there first thing to do Jedi Training so a quick trip inthe morning is nice.) And we walk to and from Epcot, it is a beautiful walk. It is nice for my husband and I to walk back in the evening for a date night as well. We've eaten at the Bakery, Seaside Sweets, and The Flying Fish many times, all fabulous. This year the service at The Flying Fish was a little off, it took a really long time to get the kids fed. But usually we have a head waiter and an assistant and this year there was just the waiter, so he was a little overwhelmed. We highly recommend The Boardwalk, and highly recommend the club level if you have a lot of mouths to feed. There is food there ALL DAY LONG. You can have a quick breakfast and head out, then have a cold beer or soda and snacks waiting when you return. My only tip would be that this is the second time we have done the dining plan (the one quick serve plus one sit down one) and this is the second time that we had a TON of food left over at the end of the trip. We drive from NY so we use the extra meals and snacks to take home, but we had a lot of them. When you go Club Level there is so much food and drink in the lounge I'm not sure the dining plan is a necessity. Next time we will try without it and then I'll put a review about how it went.

That means no easy coffee and bagel access. The BC has a mini-food court but, for the BW, it's either a small bar (Belle Vue Room) or the Boardwalk Bakery - both of which are woefully inadequate.

Next day usually cleaned the missed area. * Mattress had seen better days. Did request and receive a bed board which helped. * Only one small elevator from lobby level to Boardwalk, by bar. A few times there was a short wait with strollers / power chairs / wheelchairs backed up. * Not inexpensive, but amenities were a bit stripped down (see terry robes above).

But the Boardwalk exceeded my expectations in every way. And while it was already a special occasion for us to stay at a deluxe resort, we splurged for the club level and found the experience well worth the extra expense. Check in couldn't have been easier with folks greeting us by name, helping with bags, and whisking us up to our room in a matter of a few minutes. The process was fast, but I never felt rushed. And everyone we met had a smile and cheerful greeting. We had a king room overlooking the boardwalk. And thank you, thank you, thank you...they had a full-size crib waiting for my two-year old (he won't sleep in a pack-n-play). When making reservations, I had people give me different info: some said only pack-n-plays were available and others said cribs might be available. I was glad to see that they actually had cribs and that one was available for my son. Our room was very comfortable and quiet. The bed was very nice and easy to fall into after a day at the Parks. I never heard the activities from the boardwalk unless I opened the door to the balacony. Everything was very clean and elegant with just the right amount of Disney touches. Access to the lounge was a highlight. The staff were always a delight, giving us helpful suggestions and making my son laugh for a few minutes with peek-a-boo game across the room. It sounds a bit oxymoronic, but they manage to pull off a very elegant room while still making it a fun environment for a (pretty well-behaved) toddler. Some reviewers weren't wild about the food, but I found breakfast, evening, and late evening offerings to be quite good. The mid-day offering was pretty sparse, but I still found great value in coming in to cool off with beverages and some light snacks. And sure, they didn't have bacon and eggs at breakfast, but the oatmeal was really good...the fruit was really fresh...the pastries were really tasty...and so on. They didn't put out a huge spread, but the stuff they offered was good. We even cancelled our dinner reservations in Epcot after filling up on the evening food and beer/wine. So you get good food, and really, the expense of club level almost pays for itself when you avoid buying meals. Of course, the food is part of the attraction in Epcot, but my point is I never had to buy food because I needed it....I got food in the park because I couldn't resist crepes or the fish'n'chips. Access to the parks was easy. Walking to Epcot was great; just keep in mind that you come in behind England and that the World Showcase doesn't usualy open right away (you can't turn right into France, you go left toward Future World). Not a huge deal, but if your goal is to be first in line at major attractions, visitors at the front gate will likely beat you to the rides up front. The bus ride to and from Magic Kingdom was about 12 minutes (direct from MK to Boardwalk) and 20 minutes (from Boardwalk to MK with stops at Swan/Dolphin). I liked having all the different ways to get around: we could walk, boat, bus, or catch the monorail after walking through Epcot. I highly recommend the Boardwalk, particularly if you like Epcot. It was a great place to stay and made our visit to the parks with a toddler much easier.

It seemed as there was a nice mix of convention and families when we were there. Considering the number of families there the room we were in was very quiet. Our room looked out over the boardwalk and we didn't really notice any additional noise that was bothersome. We were an easy walk to Epcot and Hollywood studios (often walked to Dolphin and then took boat from there). The bus to Magic Kingdom was short but the one to Animal Kingdom was a bit longer and the ride home seemed quite a bit longer because of the stop at the water park. This was an ideal location for us, close to dining and a couple of parks and lots of boardwalk entertainment. Our kids would run from one entertainer to another along the boardwalk begging for just a few more minutes! The room was clean and very nice. The beds were comfortable and without request the housekeeper made up the daybed our first night. Our kids were in heaven - there own bed AND salt water taffy each night!

This was our first time staying here. We booked a standard view club level room. I requested a boardwalk view (I understood that they have a few of this particular view for their standard rooms). We were on the fourth floor and we were given the view I requested. The gentleman checking us in indicated that the hotel was not full, therefore we would get this view. The room was clean and comfortable. The view from our room was spectular and it really felt like an upgrade. Although the balcony was small with two chairs and a small table, I spent a lot of time there watching the people on the boardwalk, the boats coming and going and just enjoying the lagoon views with the Yacht and Beach club in the distance. Housekeeping did a good job keeping the room clean. Our room did have a connecting door to another room and every morning, I could clearly hear the other people laughing and talking. Fortunately, this only lasted a short time each morning, but if you had loud neighbors, this could potentially be a problem. I've stayed at many Disney resorts including the values, moderates and deluxes and I think that the Boardwalk was among our favorites. The location to Epcot was great. It only took 5 - 10 minutes walk depending on how fast you walk or you could take the boat. The boat ramp was literally off the lobby. The Hollywood Studios was also a boat ride away. There were many great restaurant choices within walking distance to the Boardwalk Inn, including the Beach & Yacht Clubs Resorts, Epcot and all of the Boardwalk restaurants. I always felt that there was something going on in this area due to the restaurants, other resorts, shops and overall location. The Boardwalk Inn was my fourth resort trying the club level and was by far the best experience. I probably would not stay club level at the other resorts again,(unless I received an upgrade or fantastic discount) but I would definitely stay club level at the Boardwalk. The food presentations were very good as far as quality and presentation. Also, the employees working on the club level were among the friendliest I have found. They always seemed eager to answer questions or help with the food/beverages. We did not use the main pool although it looked like fun but we did use the quiet pool which was more private and very pretty. My son used the hotel's gym and enjoyed it. The lobby was beautiful but on the small side. I would imagine during busy times, it could be a bit crowded. All employees we encountered during our stay were helpful and professional.

So, if you are a senior and near the pool, be prepared for the noise of happy kids continuously. Don't think by staying in the room one day it will be quiet, causde some people stay by the pool with their kids all day. Also try and make sure that your room is not all the way out like ours was. My sister had to stop several times until she reached the entrance (and we were on the 1st floor). So locatiion of your room is the main thing. The Boardwalk part is nice. There are benches to sit. Stores to see, and entertainment at night. You can also get a ferry from the Boardwalk to take you to Epcot and Downtown Disney. The room was alittle small for two, but acceptable.

They even had after-dinner drinks and desserts from 8:00 - 10:00 every night. The other great thing was that they had a balcony that we could see the fireworks from Epcot. The room was clean and the beds were comfortable. The cast members were very nice and helpful. It could be that we paid $800 a night for the room, but the price included a free meal plan for 6 of us and the concierge level amenities. We love the location and the pool is really nice. You can walk to Epcot and Disney Studios and there is bus to Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom. The hotel even let us use a wheelchair for my daughter who tore her meniscus before we left for the trip. It was convenient that they let us use the wheelchair from the hotel to go to the parks. We will definiately go back to the Boardwalk Inn.", "Date": "February 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mount Pleasant, PA", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Resort\u201d", "Author": "PMcOuntry77", "ReviewID": "UR123885757", "Content": "I took my mother on a Disney/Universal vacation and since we were only visiting Epcot, we chose the Boardwalk Inn. We really enjoyed the ambience of the Boardwalk, as well as the location. The room was much bigger than any I've stayed in on Disney property and we had a nice balcony (although small) that overlooked both the boardwalk and the water. The hotel was clean, the rooms clean, and service excellent. We really liked the fact that the double sink was separate from the toilet/shower. There was also a very nice vanity mirror. The beds/pillows were comfortable and plenty of places to plug in electronics to recharge those batteries/devices. The boardwalk itself (not the inn) was a bit disappointing. I enjoyed the Wyland Gallery, but the bakery which claims to be excellent, was not. We ordered several pastries, and maybe I'm picky because my mother was a pastry chef, but every pastry was made out of the same thing. The danish's were mostly pastry with a small quarter size of cheese and/or apple in the middle. We did not eat at any of the restaurants on the boardwalk or get to visit the general store. We also didn't partake in any nightlight, so I can't comment on those things. I don't recommend room service for food. We decided to get room service for breakfast one day to save time. While the portions were fine, the food wasn't at all very good and we ate maybe half of what they brought us. My mother had the omelet which she said she could make better at home and I had to agree on that sentiment with my buttermilk pancakes. The food was lukewarm. I've had the same results with room service at another Disney hotel, so I was really too surprised. They claimed there would be lots of boardwalk entertainment. I saw 3 entertainers from my balcony the entire 4 nights we were there. They were short acts, nice enough, but not the fire eating, flame throwing, acts they show on the Disney site. Just basic juggling/magic acts. This could be because we went on the off-season though. The location for getting to Epcot and catching the bus was great. The bus goes directly from Boardwalk to Downtown Disney, which is nice, but that means Boardwalks is the very last stop on the way back. If you are extremely tired, you might want to take a nap on the bus as it stops at 3 or 4 other hotels first. The only problem we had with the hotel was the fact that we received several stained towels (looked like blood) and several had holes in them. I think if a towel has a hole or stain, they need to be thrown out. I'm staying at a deluxe resort, I expect to have nice, clean looking towels. And of course, the room service food! I would put this on the lower scale of the deluxe resorts, but I did love the large, spacious, rooms and the overall ambience. Also, we were not bothered by any noise(s) from the boardwalk, and our room was right on top of it. The only thing we heard was the horn from the boats which was easily tuned out.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cFavorite Disney resort\u201d", "Author": "sunshinedaydream1", "ReviewID": "UR123881351", "Content": "This is my second stay at the Boardwalk and has quickly become a favorite of mine!

For those guests with the park hopper option (highly recommended!), Epcot is a great night spot to hit after a day at Magic Kingdom or Animal Kingdom and it's right outside your door. Come back to your room, relax and grab some food then head out for a few hours to Epcot. I have found its really the best way to get the most from your time at Disney.\u00a0 An excellent atmosphere/decor and friendly staff throughout. For pin traders, there is a large pin book at guest services and the staff may look out back for pins if you make friends with the right people. \u00a0As one of Disney's luxury hotels it is hard to find fault with the property or the staff but there are a few notes that will make your stay there more enjoyable.\u00a0 First, there are really two parts to the hotel; the Inn and the Villa separated by the main lobby. \u00a0The difference is that the villas are used for the Disney vacation club and are a little more sparse, while the Inn is more of a traditional hotel. For example, a studio on the Villa side has a queen bed and pull out sofa and a standard room in the Inn has 2 queens beds and a pull out for the same price.\u00a0 Second, ask for a room near the lobby if possible. \u00a0Noise is not an issue and there are rooms that are an actual 5 minute walk from the lobby; while it may not seem like a hike now, try it after a day of walking the parks.\u00a0 Third, if you are interested using the main pool area it is located on the Villa side of the property. This combined with distant room on the Inn side could mean a long walk in your suit and a towel. While this hotel is not on the monorail, there is a monorail station at Epcot. I would highly recommend renting a vehicle as it makes getting between the parks shorter and easier than the shuttles or monorail. Also getting back and forth from the airport is quicker with a car.

Our flight landed at 3PM, however between waiting for the shuttle, transport time, checking in to our hotel, we did not get to EPCOT until after 6pm. Luckily, with the extra magic hours for Disney resort guests, we stayed at EPCOT until midnight and experienced most of the park. I don't see the advantage of a Disney resort beyond the free airport transfers and the extra magic hours at the parks. For a young couple without children, staying at Disney's Beach Club would have made more sense.

Here are my observations based on 3 days - The Boardwalk has everything you'd expect from Disney.... friendly/helpful employees, clean and bright large rooms, spotless grounds, and lots of nearby activities. The Boardwalk also seems to be better suited to adults, or those traveling with older children. Although there were certainly things that would interest little ones, the surrounding area has a Dance Hall, a dueling piano bar, an ESPN Zone and other places that appeal to an older set. It's also \"walkable\" to Epcot. At night, you'll find magicians and other street performers to keep you entertained.

The grounds aren't very spread out so navigating the resort is easy. We stayed in 1339 - a quick cut across the courtyard and we were at the lobby. One thing we read was the \"long hallways, etc\" but you can always cut through buildings and enjoy the *outside* of the resort which is perfect Disney. The Boardwalk itself was entertaining. We found ourselves eating breakfast out there every morning (Boardwalk Joes for coffee, juice, 2 muffins and a cereal, approx $12.00 total). We also found ourselves out there every night on our way back from Epcot (more on that). Funnel cakes, $6, corn dogs $4, etc, all from the snack kiosk. For my money, the best value was a slice of pretty good pizza for $4 on our way out the door in the afternoon after swimming. Perfect snack before taking on the parks. Didn't try ESPN Zone, Cat Cora's, or Flying Fish - my 5 year old wouldn't have appreciated it. BIG Disney store on the boardwalk. All your typical Disney merch plus food items like Lunchables $3 and beer - 6-pack of Miller Lite $15. Pool was awesome. The slide is a trip! Leaping Horse Libations had plenty of options ranging from soda $2.50, tap beer $5.50+, frozen cocktails $7+, Sangria $8. The food is prepackaged and didn't look very appealing. Limited items too. We brought microwave popcorn down to the pool in our bag. There was a \"pool party\" every afternoon at 2pm for the kids. Good music and good vibe down there. The service was unbelievable. We didn't wait in line at check-in, someone came out and met us with our folder. We got a stroller delivered by Orlando Strollers and that too was ready for us immediately. The room was cleaned early everyday with something \"cute\" done to my son's toys. Everyone at every stop was literally beyond nice and fun. NOW for the best part - the location. Our day generally ended up at Epcot because you can literally walk there in 5-10 minutes depending on your pace. You enter through the International Gateway near England or Canada. Picture this: We hit one of the parks during the day, then went swimming, ate some food, then strolled into Epcot, our son would fall asleep in his stroller and Mom and Dad got some parent time in the Lands of Epcot. It felt like two separate trips! To put the location in perspective, on our last night my son lost his favorite toy he bought from the shop by Spaceship Earth. I decided to quickly run and get him a new one...it took me 32 minutes to walk from the room, to the \"Ball\" and back with this toy - that is how close you are! Bus ride to Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom weren't bad - maybe 20 minutes tops. And you can boat it to Hollywood Studios or walk there as well - walk is 10-15 minutes, boat about the same. Tip: We would end up at Epcot after Magic Kingdom via Monorail so we could grab up some fast-passes for that night. Then we'd walk home! Too easy. Then we'd walk back into Epcot and ride Soaring and Test Track at night. Overall, we narrowed our choices to Animal Kingdom Lodge, Wilderness Lodge and Boardwalk and simply based on it's proximity to Epcot we know we made the correct choice.

They also had a dessert buffet every night as well and could see part of the fireworks from Epcot. We received great help in booking reservations for meals and activities. The parks were surprisingly busy for it being off season and was hard to get into dining venues for sit down meals, but the concierge helped us get into the restaurants we really wanted to eat at.

I had stayed at other Disney resorts before and never had a bad experience but this one tops them all!!! First class service all the way! Check in was a breeze, no wait at all. However we did get a room with one King Size bed and we had requested pne of the double Queen rooms. I went back to check in and i was in a new room within 5 minutes, no question asked, even had a better view! The room was perfect. Lots of room....beds were comfortable....furnishings in great shape and classy old school decor. The double vanity can in very handy. The bathroom itself was small but great shower pressure (a huge must for me)!! The maid service was great. We hardly ever saw them and always had enough towels and supplies. The staff itself was outstanding. There was one staff member...i do not remember her name but she was the one that checked us in....that gave my son baloons and stickers everytime she saw him and made his day by just remembering him and calling him by name each day. As for the resort itself....there was nothing bad I could say. The pool was awesome. The Boardwalk itself is incredible. What a great way to spend a night. We spent the $15 on refillable mugs and made great use of them. Even when we went to the different places for just refills everyone was so accomadating. The ESPN Club had great wings. The ice cream shop was a great treat every night and the Pizza Window was awesome...i think my son ate a slice everyday we were there! Being able to walk to EPCOT was outstanding and the boat to Hollywood Studios was a breeze too! If i had any complaints or issues....there would only be 2 minor ones. 1) while the bus transportation is a major perk, i was pretty annoying to have to sit through 3 or 4 different stops everytime we used to buses. They weren't always very crowded but in the few times they were it was an issue since we had a stroller and a 3 year old we had to try to stand with on the buses. DIdn't think this was very safe at all. I would think a Deluxe resort would get it's own bus stop or at least only have to share with one other hotel. Not 4 different ones. 2) As I said....service was outstanding....check in was awesome...check out was easy enough....except for the awful attitude of the parking and loading attendant. Evidently you are only allowed to park in the loading zone in front of the door if you are using a bell hop. Considering we were in a rush to leave since we were driving back to VA that morning and the next available bell hop would be a 30 minute wait....i decided to pull my car up and load it myself. I was met very rudely by this employee and told I could only park there for about 5 minutes and my car would be moved so the bell hops could load up cars. I informed him that I believe I had just as much right to load my car myself as anyone else given the amount of money I had already spent on property over my week long stay. He didn't like that too much and muttered some words under his breath as he walked away. Just a minor blip...but did leave me a little ticked off after such a great stay.

As for the Boardwalk, it is on a beautiful lake shared by the Beach Eub Resort and the Yacht Club Resort and is adjacent to the Swan and Dolphin Disney/Sheraton shared properties. The Boardwalk is sort of \"Dumbo's Circus\" or Carnival themed and is very fun for kids yet elegant for adults. There was easy access to eating at the cafes and restaurants just outside the back on the lake. ESPN Club is right there for great eating and sports watching. The dance club was great for our group of 12 thirty-somethings, who wanted to have a few drinks and dance after dinner but only walk 3 minutes from the Boardwalk. Kids can enjoy the amazing pool and waterslide, games in the Community room and much, much more. Really, this location had something for everyone! The largest benefit was its proximity to EPCOT. You walk 5-7 minutes and you can enter via the World Showcase, at France. It was superb. I would stay here for this reason alone again.

We stayed on the concierge level, and were greeted by name as soon as we received our luggage from the Magical Express driver. They immediately took us inside and took care of our luggage.(our room wasn't ready-it was only 11:30 am when we arrived). We were then led upstairs to the concierge desk to check in. They had an offer for us, so the manager took the 6 kids to the Innkeepers Lounge for snacks while we discussed the offer. We were offered a single room (two bedroom suite) at the Beach Club, but chose to stay with our two connecting rooms at the Boardwalk. If that doesn't tell you anything about our past experience with the Boardwalk, I don't know what will. Because we were staying at the Boardwalk they placed a rush on our rooms, and while we were discussing the park info. we got word that one of our rooms was now ready. We finished our discussion and went to the Innkeepers Lounge to gather the kids and head to our room. Jackie in concierge arranged for our luggage to be brought up to our room instead of us having to go back down to bell services and request it ourselves. We were in our room no more than 2-3 minutes and bell services called to make sure that we were there to accept our luggage(we had a card stating how many pieces of luggage we had checked that they needed to verify). Our luggage was then delivered to our room within minutes! Then we were off to the parks! We received a text message before 2:00 that our other room was ready. Our experiences with Jackie, Anita, and Lorenzo in the Innkeepers Lounge was outstanding! They even nicknamed the kids \"the six pack\". They always went our of their way to help us any way they could. Whether it was juice boxes, water, or extra snacks-they always went out of their way for us. One day, Lorenzo saw us come in for breakfast and pulled enough chairs over to a table so that we could all sit together! Talk about service-WOW! Anita and Lorenzo even remembered us from last year and were commenting on how much the kids have grown, and what their favorite snacks were. My daughter had a friend along this year, and she commented how great they were and how funny they were. They were always telling us jokes and laughing along with us. The rooms themselves are clean, and large enough for our family. We had four people in each room, and didn't feel cramped for space. We even had a jogging stroller in each room! We had an issue with a tv in one of the rooms on the first day. I mentioned it to housekeeping, and it was fixed before we returned to our room that night. I've read on some reviews that people wish the resorts had free wifi- my feelings are if you're on vacation- go on vacation and leave work at home! If you're at the resorts for work, come on- if work is already paying for a deluxe hotel-why wouldn't they also pay for the internet connection? One of the great things about the Boardwalk is its location. We went to all four parks, and always felt like our hotel was in the middle. We walked to Epcot and Hollywood Studios, and took the bus to Animal Kingdom(the only transportation available) We only had to wait a few minutes for the bus in both directions which was great. We had hopper passes, so we would walk to Epcot and walk over to the monorail and take that to the Magic Kingdom. This is personal choice, but I've noticed that a lot of people don't consider this to be an option.(the only time it doesn't work is during extra magic hours and Epcot isn't open) However, those with strollers might find it helpful because you don't have to fold up the stroller to get on the bus. Two of the kids were sleeping in strollers when we left the Magic Kingdom, but Epcot was closed so we had to take the bus. It would be have sooo much nicer to let them sleep and take the monorail to Epcot and walk back to the Boardwalk.

The resort is decorated in a lovely early twenties(?) style; very fancy. The service was great, and the club level came with a special lounge ony for CL guests; you need a key to get in. In the AM from 7-10 (6:30 for coffee) there is a large continental breakfast spread with pastries, bagels, cereal, friut and hot oatmeal. From 3-5 there are snacks (pretzles, chips, and drinks such as soda and lemonade), from 5-7 Pm there are wonderful hors douevers (cheeses, crackers, hummus, pitas, olive salad, friuts, potstickers, stuffed grape leaves...) and wine, beer and soda. There are two hot choices each night. Then from 8-10 they offer fancy desserts and cordials. We took advantage of the free dining plan, and with that breakfast is not included, so the breakfast was a great perk! There are many stores and restaurants on the Boardwalk, and it is all lit up at night. They have magicians and different acts each night along the BW. The pool is good sized and has a restaurant there which accepts the dining plan. We walked to Epcot from there, 10-15 minute walk, and you can also walk to Hollywood Studios, which is about 20 minutes. If you wait for the Disney transportation to take you anywhere, plan on 45 mins. The busses come every 20 minutes, then you probably have to stop at other resorts to get guests. The transportation service is great. My advice is to get to the parks BEFORE THEY OPEN! I think the key to make Disney a stress free trip is to educate youreself, have your dining reservations made well in advance, to allot an hour to get to/from park/resort, and to get up early to arrive at the parks when they open. We returned to the resort after lunch to swim and nap before our dinner at the reserved restaurant. REMEMBER: unless you get Hopper passes, if you make a dining reservation within a park, you HAVE to go to THAT park that day. For example: If you want to eat at MK, you need to have a MK ticket that day. You cant go to MK for the day and have dinner at Epcot that night unless you buy a separate ticket for Epcot or you have a Hopper pass. We did not have Hopper passes....we just had all our ducks in a row and decided in advance which park we were going to that day, then made our dining reservations. Make them ASAP!! Dont forget: if you stay on Disney property you get to take advantage of the Magic Hours at the parks. Look at these hours before you make your dining reservations and plan accordingly!!

The king size bed was so comfortable, we didn't want to get up in the mornings! And the a nice large balcony in the bedroom that overlooks the quiet pool and garden. So we LOVED our room. The Concierge lounge was a nice amenity to have. We went in there several times a day to check out the snack options and just hang out. The concierge staff was so friendly and helpful. When you stay in a concierge room, they actually check you in one on one in your suite and explain all your amenities, services and tickets you have. The resort itself is our favorite of all the ones we have stayed at (we have stayed at Wilderness Lodge, Fort Wilderness, Contemporary, Grand Floridian and Animal Kingdom). We love being right on the boardwalk because we can walk to Epcot- our favorite park! Plus the atmosphere on the boardwalk at night is so nice. The staff at the hotel are very helpful and kind. We used the exercise facility every morning and did laundry once while working out because the 24 hour laundry room is right next to the gym. Both are nice to have when on along vacation. The restaurants on site that we tried were wonderful: Kouzinna for breakfast was our favorite meal. Not your standard breakfast fare and very healthy! Big River Grill is a great \"bar food\" type eatery to me. We had some yummy spinach dip, lunch sandwiches and adult beverages in here! You can walk easily to the Swan/Dolphin for some good sushi at BlueZoo and the to the Yacht Club for a great steak. The main pool was fun at the Boardwalk; great little carousel bar right by the pool! The quiet pool was tight near our room and such a quiet little area to getaway from the crown and noise. Plus the hot tubs were wonderful at the end of the long days. The only thing that I do not like about this hotel is that the parking is so far away from the front entrance and valet is just not something I want to spend spare money on. But all Disney hotels have the same parking issue to me.

You can walk to the world showcase section of Epcot in a few minutes, and a little longer of a walk will take you to Hollywood Studios. There are also boats to take you to the two parks. Having a small child with us, it was also great to have the boardwalk because we were able to push the stroller around the water front and had the ESPN Club, Kouzzina (great food), Big River Grille, and Flying Fish restaurants all right outside the hotel. There is also a pizza window, and a few food carts. The pool also serves sandwiches and light snacks. The desserts at the bakery were addicting and outstanding and I am not a sweets person. The best part is if you are on the Disney Dining Plan you can use your snack allotments at the bakery. As for the cons, the pool is entirely too small. While the Disney parks were relatively quiet, the pool was crowded the entire stay and it was very difficult to find a spot when coming back from the parks in the middle of the day. One day in particular the kids pool was full of adults because there was nowhere left to go. There is a quiet pool right behind it, which was rarely crowded, but it was even smaller. The hotel is also in need of a facelift. We had a two bedroom that consisted of a one bedroom without a studio lockout. Both rooms were a little dated. The furniture was beaten up, missing buttons, deep scratches on the wood and table and the rug outside the bathroom in the main bedroom was thread bare and worn out. Don't try sleeping on the pullout, thankfully nobody had to God Bless anyone who does. A marble slab may have been more comfortable. The two rooms had three balconies that were not connected and all were tiny. Some cool things that I noticed: nightly campfire and movie by the pool, kids activities, crafts, movie rentals, and toys to play with at the community hall, interactive games for kids by the pool, and a nice weight room Some not so cool things I noticed: no pool hopping on the weekends, checking room cards and handing out wrist bands. The pool at beach club pool was off limits. The pool bar/grill shuts down at 7:30 while the pool stays open till 11. I will sum it up this way, as far as hotel standards go this is an outstanding place. For Disney standards it's just pretty good.

We were an extended family of 7 and booked two rooms. Unfortunately, they did not accommodate my request to have the rooms side by side. The best they could do was offer us rooms down the hall from each other. The frustrating part of this was that I made special phone calls to Disney early on so that our reservations would be joined. The Disney reservation system is a huge gripe of mine, but here is neither the time or place. . . I found the Boardwalk Inn layout mildly frustrating. Since we were on the first floor, we had to go up stairs only to go back down other stairs. Being that one of the individuals in our party had a wheel chair, made it worse than it was. Aside from all that, the rooms were clean and very spacious. The Boardwalk itself was wonderful. There were things for the kids to do and the performers entertained them for chunks of time. The Boardwalk made it so much more then a hotel, it was a place to go, eat, relax, have fun, watch the Epcot fireworks, etc. Other Disney resorts that I have stayed at don't have that ability. Even the beautiful Grand Floridian didn't have as much to do. And if you get board you can walk to the other hotels - The Yacht and Beach Club are right around the lake. The Restaurant Cape May at the Beach Club was also excellent and convenient since you can walk back to your hotel. You also have choices in park transportation. The Boat Launch to Hollywood Studios, Buses to AK and MK but the best is that you can walk straight into the International side of Epcot (or take a boat). One night I even did a run around the countries picking up dinner and bringing it back to the hotel! The BEST BEST BEST part is that it is within walking distance of a Hess Gas Station, where you can buy reasonably priced drinks and snacks.

This is basically a hotel within the hotel. As other reviews have focused more on the general hotel, I'm going to focus primarily upon our experience in this part. However, the general hotel has a great swimming pool that the kids thought were great (the slide takes a full 15 seconds from the top to the bottom of the slide . . . pretty good for a hotel pool.) The pool had a DJ for the kids and they were doing kids activities at the pool when we were there. I was also impressed with the staffed gym. The machines were new, and clean. The staff member was pleasant. The temperature was kept on the cooler side, which I was happy for. Our room itself was the Sonora Suite. We were told that this is the only room that Rita Moreno will stay at, and that she is a frequent guest at Disney. This suite had three rooms. The main room had a Bose surround sound, couch, an 8 person dining room table, with two double french doors leading out to a deceptively narrow balcony. The balcony had typical balcony furniture. There was a pantry/kitchen area that had a Keureg coffee maker with about 20 different varieties of coffees and teas. Evian water in the fridge. A microwave, wine bottle opener, and can opener were all there as well. There was a half bath in the entry way. The master bedroom had another french door leading onto the balcony, and the bed was incredibly comfortable. The master bath had his and his sinks, with a TV in the middle. There was a wonderful shower, with a deep tub. I availed myself of the jetted tub and found that it was great, but was a bit mystified to not have any sort of bath salts. Again, a minor quibble, but a bit unusual in its absence. There was a desk, but sadly disney does not provide free internet. Quite the shocker, that was not a pleasant surprise. We used my phone as a wi-fi hotspot and saved a ton of money that way. The kids bedroom had two queen beds, and they had a door onto the balcony, with a separate entrance onto the hallway. Maid service was incredible. We got all the usual towels and such folded into interesting patterns, but one of the things that was made was a teddy bear out of towels. We hadn't seen that one before, and everyone was delighted. Everything was kept well stocked, and sparkling clean, in the entire hotel, not just our room. We used the laundry service and were tickled. It's expensive, but when you need it, it's there and they do good work. The concierges, Melana, Jackie, and Scott blew our expectations out of the water. I needed some personal items not available there, and Jackie went, on her day off, and did some shopping for me in Orlando. THAT is service of the highest order. Melana and Scott just bent over backwards to make us feel like a part of the family. If we even mentioned something, they were all over themselves to make it happen. They made our stay truly wonderful and even more magical. The actual concierge room, almost always had snacks. The continental breakfast was a wee bit lackluster. Most hotels offer eggs and sausage and bacon. They had fruit and oatmeal and pastries. Heavy on the carbs, almost no protein except for some yogurt, that really wasn't very good. That was a bit of a disappointment. However, the staff there (of which, there were ALWAYS 3 staff members on duty when we were there, making sure that everything met your expectations) were great. The desserts good, and I enjoyed the wine as well as the cordials later on. The staff had no problems (in fact they encouraged it) with you taking bottles of evian back to your suite.

The only time you are in the room is when you collapse from 14 hours of Disney stuff. You won't care what is on TV. You won't care what is going on outside or what it looks like outside. :) The hotel lobby is beautiful inside. The staff eagerly looks to assist you and makes check-in a breeze. The rooms were great. I think I read where Disney updates a certain percentage of rooms in each hotel each year -- I think we lucked out and got one of those newly refurbished rooms; mattress felt like they were brand new. The Boardwalk is a destination in itself. We talked to people who visited Downtown Disney. Somehow, they found out about Boardwalk and they went to Boardwalk the next night instead. We ate at Cat Cora's place one night and it was literally steps away. There is a great little bakery that's essentially next to the hotel. They're open late and I miss that place more than anything. You can hop down to the bakery for a sandwich or for pastries. There are little tables out front by the water to eat breakfast. It's just a great place. Boardwalk is directly across the water from Beach Club, and the Swan and Dolphin are visible. The boat ferry service to Hollywood and Epcot is right out front of the hotel. Boat service also takes you to the back of Epcot. Repeat --- you can only get to the front entrance of Epcot via buses. Boats and walking take you in at the back of Epcot (which was not a problem at all for us). During the night, ESPN has a big crowd with lots of stuff to do. There's also bike rentals where you can slowly cruise around the boardwalk. They're expensive. Hollywood Studios is a short 10 minute walk along the water. You can take the boat if you like but it's quicker to walk. Epcot is a 5 minute walk. Note that you come in the back entrance near England. All the rides ... and the monorail ... are at the front of Epcot. If you intend to do Late Magic Hours at Magic Kingdom, be advised that after 11pm the ONLY way back to the hotel is via the buses. Don't take the monorail and thing you can get to Epcot. At that late hour, the monorail won't go there. And I suggest finishing out the fireworks show very near the exit of Magic Kingdom. The only downside is there is no monorail service but all the upsides make that irrelevant. I don't see ever staying at a different hotel while at Disney World. This one is the best because it is closest to what WE like. Your mileage may vary. :)", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Markham, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat location..loved the charm\u201d", "Author": "agbbrown", "ReviewID": "UR112946537", "Content": "MY wife and I did a fair bit of research on the web and we were very happy with our choice of the Boardwalk Inn.

I shared a quad room with a few of my friends. It was slightly cramped but a lot of fun. The room itself was nice, and on the larger side. It's decorated with a nod to the Boardwalk theme, with the linens in softer hues and wood furniture. There was a small desk, a decently sized mini-fridge, a safe, an iron/ironing board, and a big flatscreen TV. The bathroom was the split style, with toilet and shower/tub combo in one (tiny!) room and double sinks and vanity outside. Very convenient if you have a larger party and are all trying to get ready in the morning. Our room had a large balcony overlooking Epcot and the courtyard and villas. The balcony was fantastic for watching Illuminations at night - a nice reminder that you really are a stone's throw away from Epcot. It was nice to relax out there during downtime and enjoy the quiet space. The hotel itself is HUGE. Don't be fooled by its humble facade when you first enter the driveway. It's gigantic, and there are multiple wings, including one for DVC members only. You could probably get lost in this place if you didn't have a decent sense of direction. The Boardwalk's lobby is very pretty, with a very distinctive early 1900s Boardwalk theme throughout. Lots of wood, cozy, overstuffed sofas and armchairs, and a fireplace, all of which give you a feel of being in someone's opulent living room. The real centerpieces of the lobby area are two huge, detailed models of a rollercoaster and a carousel. Press a button and they come to life - very cool. The porch immediately outside the lobby has some nice wicker furniture and a view overlooking the grounds, another nice touch. Near the lobby is a small restaurant, only open for breakfast as far as I saw. The rest of the day it functions as a small lounge with some books and board games. Since we were there in January, it was too cold to use the pools, but they were large and looked nice. It was actually kind of sad to see the lifeguards stuck outside, dressed in windbreakers, watching the empty pools and dancing to the pool music on the speakers. One pool is a quiet, adult pool near the villas. The other is a huge kids' fantasy pool in the Boardwalk carnival theme, decorated with lots of bright colors, circus animals, and a carousel. It even has a towering waterslide where you exit via a frightening clown's oversized mouth. There was also a small jacuzzi adjacent. Around the hotel: Since you're kind of stuck on Disney property, be prepared to pay Disney prices if you want to eat. As I mentioned earlier, the hotel has a small restaurant/lounge. The Boardwalk area in the backyard of the hotel has more places to eat, including a Brewery, Cat Cora's Kouzzina restaurant, the Boardwalk Bakery, the ESPN cafe, and a general store. It sounds like a lot of choices, but the options do get tiring after awhile. The Boardwalk area comes alive in the early evening/at night, with bike rides, carnival games, food vendors, and street performers like magicians. There's also Jellyrolls, a piano bar, and the main attraction, the Atlantic dance hall. My friend's wedding reception was held here and it was beautifully decorated and run. The next night, we returned to see the club in action. It was a Saturday night with no cover, and surprisingly busy for being a Disney club. The bar was very busy and it was difficult to get a drink at times. Music was so-so, ranging from dated to fairly recent. They project music videos on a large screen above the dancefloor, so you'll always be entertained. I also liked the fact there were lots of small tables around for hanging out and escaping the club part for awhile. During the day the Boardwalk is a pleasant place to go for a walk and enjoy the scenery as the Disney water taxis (the \"FriendShips\") pass by constantly. Walk around the lake and you'll end up at the Yacht club and Beach club resorts, or at the back door of Epcot, as a friend and I unwittingly discovered on our first day. If you continue further past the Boardwalk resort (or take the \"FriendShip\"), you'll hit the Swan and Dolphin resorts, and Disney's Hollywood studios. This is a nice, clean, comfortable hotel with an imaginative theme and decor. Is it worth the exorbitant rate you'll pay ($300+/night) to stay on Disney property? Definitely not. Unfortunately, it loses a star for price.

We stayed at Port Orleans for 2 nights in order to take advantage of boat transportation to Downtown Disney, and then transferred to Boardwalk to be near Epcot. (Also saved $ by splitting time between mid- and deluxe-priced resorts). Had no issues with our luggage being moved from one resort to the other - very efficiently handled while we were at the parks. Boardwalk is a large resort, with conference center. My kids were disappointed by no free WiFi, but liked the room layout and location. Our room on the 3rd floor overlooked the front entrance and Magical Express pickup location, but I'm actually glad we didn't pay more to overlook the boardwalk and water, because I think those rooms would pick up a lot of the noise below. Walking back from Epcot one night at 11 pm, there were groups of teenagers throwing a football on the lawn area between the hotel and boardwalk itself, and I'd imagine the sound just amplified, up to the higher floors. Pastries/breakfast beverages were sold in the small lounge area on the 2nd floor, and I think the pastries were from the Boardwalk Bakery. In the morning, long lines formed outside the Bakery on the boardwalk outside, but there was a little cart/vendor right across from the Bakery selling the same items, with no line! We saved a lot of time by buying them at the cart, and eating while walking to Epcot. Main draw to this resort for us was the walkability to Epcot. The entrance to Epcot is between the France and England pavilions, and it's great to not have to deal with the long lines at the main entrance to the park. Takes about 5-10 minutes, depending how fast you walk. My only gripe is with the \"bag inspection\" - is anything actually found in a bag that is ever an issue? It really holds up the line when you get behind a family who brings 3 large stuffed backpacks with 18 different compartments in each pack! (What the heck do they pack in those, anyway?) The pool's waterslide was closed for repairs when we were there, and the first day the pool was closed when spraypaint got in the water. Disappointing, but what can you do? Pool was open the next day, and seemed very clean. Bar near the pool serves drinks and snacks. We ate at ESPN Club 2 nights - very easy to get seats in restaurant part, because most people want to be in the area where they broadcast (on the left as you walk in). Kids loved the Club - \"Mom, there are 8 TVs in the restrooms!\" and staff will change a channel for you, so you can watch what you want while you eat. Walked to marina on the opposite side of the lake, and rented Jet Skis (can't remember Disney's name for them). Kids 12 and older can drive by themselves, and this was a nice break from the theme parks on a hot day. Charge was around $32 for 1/2 hour and $45 for 60 minutes. 2 can fit in each Jet Ski.

It was a strong desire to stay at the Boardwalk, so when my husband's company arranged a conference there I HAD to tag along :) I LOVED how close the property was to EPCOT and Hollywood Studios. It not only was within walking distance, but if you started walking before the boat left the dock at the resort, you could beat the boat to the gate to both parks. With a park hopper it was definitely worth staying at Boardwalk. The rooms were pretty consistent with the other rooms that I have stayed in at the other resorts. Double sinks came in handy. The water pressure did not seem great. Loved the balcony that looked out onto the Boardwalk. I liked how close of a walk it was to get to our room from anywhere in the property (unlike AKL). Only issue with the sound in the room was that you could hear the boats coming in and some captains liked to honk excessively compared to others. The service was good, check-in took very little time (which was good because it was close to 1am when we checked in). However the staff member did not seem like the friendliest person working..but it could have also been the late time we were checking in. The Boardwalk was a great place to hang out as well...we went to Kouzzina for dinner our first night and it was really good (make reservations in advance though). The Sangria was awesome as well and you can get it at the pizza window! The Bakery was really good (I loved the tomato and mozzarella sandwich). We also went to Jellyrolls, which even though there is a cover charge to get in, it was well worth the money and we had a blast it was so entertaining.

I did make use of the general store/disney shop that is located on the boardwalk as you walk out of the hotel. It is stocked with snacks, beer, small selection of liquor, cigars, ie the stuff i look for when im on vacation, and of course disney merchandise. Overall If I returned to disney I would probably stay at a different hotel, the location is nice, but disney has transportation down pat so overall if you are staying at any disney property you will get to where you want to go with no issue.", "Date": "February 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Walnut Creek, CA", "Title": "\u201cBusiness Traveler's Nightmare\u201d", "Author": "greg1968", "ReviewID": "UR94701886", "Content": "Don't plan on getting any work done at this hotel. The internet service is a nightmare. You will be more productive at a Motel 6 or some other fleabag hotel. Whoever devised/designed this hotel's internet services must have been on drugs. Let me count the ways that Boardwalk Inn's internet service is the worst by far I have ever experience in my years of business travel. (No one comes even remotely close) 1) No wi-fi in rooms. 2) Boardwalk charges for purportedly \"high speed\" etherrnet access via in-room cable. I might be able to overlook the fact that they charge for in-room internet, except for the speed is so slow as to be practically unusable. It is NOT high-speed. 3) If you are attending a conference at this hotel, you will need to pay an additional fee (on top of your in-room fee) to access wi-fi in the convention center. Only problem is, the wi-fi only works in the convention center lobby. There is no wi-fi coverage in the actual conference rooms, so if you attending a meeting or conference you have to leave the conference room if you want wi-fi coverage. 4) They have wi-fi in the hotel lobby, but if you want to use it, you must pay extra for that too (separate charge from in-room internet, and separate from convention center lobby). But there are only two bars of wi-fi signal strength, so download speeds are slow. And that is if you can even get connected in the first place. I tried three credit cards and none of them worked. I had to ask the manager to help get me connected, which meant waiting 15 minutes while she called customer service for Disney's wi-fi provider. After getting me connected the service suddenly terminated 5 minutes later, and I had to get the manager to once again get things working again. In summary, it is a separate charge to access the internet via ethernet cable in your room, yet another separate charge to access wi-fi in the conference room lobby (no access in the conference rooms), and yet another separate charge to access wi-fi in the hotel lobby. All of the above are either slow, buggy, or have limited range, or a combination of the above.

We choose this hotel again because we were at WDW for Marathon Weekend, and the proximity to the race start was a plus. Like others reviewers, we completed the on-line check-in, only to find that there is no expedited, separate station at the Boardwalk. As a result, I waited in the same long line as everyone else. I did receive a view upgrade (without asking), which was wonderful until I see the rusted windows and obvious leaking and wallpaper destruction underneath. (This did take away from the view of the courtyard just a bit...) HOWEVER, the most disappointing and unacceptable part of this stay was the fact that THERE WAS NO HOT WATER IN OUR ROOM. Imagine running at 5:30 am, at 45 temperatures, coming back for a nice hot shower, and finding less than lukewarm water. I initially received no response from management, and called back after waiting for 3 hours for maintenance- time not spent at the parks. After 6 additional calls, someone did come up, and the engineer did admit to me that \"one of their boilers was down\". It wasn't until the following morning that we had hot, hot water, and not a single manager called back to check if our problem was resolved.

We purchased a Disney Package and were told since we had checked in online, we would expedite receiving our tour package and room keys. On the bus, the video confirmed that there is a special desk at the resorts for online checked guests. Nope, not at the Boardwalk. The desk clerk advised me that the printers weren\u2019t working and he would have to complete our information manually. He was moderately pleasant. I asked a few questions about the return trip and referred me to the Concierge, who referred me to the Bell Captains desk, who gave me inaccurate information (we had an early flight home on December 16 and wanted to be sure we did things right.) Our room was a bit worn but serviceable. Some toast remnants on the kitchenette counter and the back splash needed a little cleaning, but OK. The room is pretty much standard Marriott Courtyard, except for the price. The towel hanger on the back of the door is a round knob which will not hold a towel when you close the door. The fold out sofa bed has a thin foam mattress\u2026to be expected I guess, but coupled with a raised metal rail, requires gymnastics to get in and out of the bed without banging your knee. It is not possible to sit on the bed and hang your legs over without the rail digging in to the back of your knees or thighs. We had the Disney Dining plan, but I was surprised when we obtained two muffins, a banana, and an orange in the hotel at breakfast and it cost us two meals and two snacks. Really? No complimentary continental breakfast at a deluxe resort?? Over the length of our stay, we found the staff to be like the desk clerk\u2026 not rude but not really helpful, either, and certainly not what you see in the Disney advertising. This is our second stay at a Disney \u201cLuxury\u201d resort. Three years ago we stayed across the waterway at the Beach Club Villas. Each day, we returned to a clean room and a little array of \u201ctowel origami\u201d around our son\u2019s bath toys. This is apparently not the way it is done at the Boardwalk. We found the gift shop/sundries store surprisingly well stocked and the shopkeepers very friendly and helpful\u2026obviously a separate vendor from the hotel management. We received a note under the door Monday advising us they would be upgrading the hotel\u2019s computer system from Tuesday at 5:30 until sometime Wednesday afternoon. We returned to our room on our last night (Wednesday) and discovered our room had not been serviced. When we asked for fresh towels (remember we can't reuse them because there are no hooks) housekeeping told us they missed our cleaning because the computers were down until around 3 pm that day. I'm amazed they didn't manually track which rooms required cleaning. I think they did that before computers... Oddly, the elevators were set to close very quickly after opening\u2026you had to run and block the door to get in. Maybe a dozen people commented on that in our presence. One 65-ish woman walking with a cane missed the elevator and hit the door with her can in frustration. My family ran into two room maintenance/repair guys in the hallway and mentioned it to them. They explained that was not their work responsibility. They did not offer to report it to the person in charge of the elevators. Transportation from the Boardwalk consists of water taxis, buses and walking. The buses that ran to Downtown Disney made numerous stops, and were often too full to take passengers. We discovered that a regular taxicab from Hollywood to Boardwalk and from Boardwalk to Coronado Springs was only $5-6 plus tip. A taxicab from Boardwalk to Animal Kingdom was only $7.50. Overall, our opinion is that we cannot recommend the Boardwalk as a destination. We are thinking that we will stay off site at Marriott or Hilton and enjoy better accommodations for less money.

I saved for four months to pay for this trip with my fiancee and it was worth every penny. The service, from what I experienced, was great. As someone who hates to ask for help, there were a few moments where I had no choice as well as pleasant times it was offered. It began when we stepped off the Magical Express that had conveniently taken us from the Airport to the front door of our resort. I know some people have had luggage issues, but the luggage was at our room ten minutes after we got there. The club level concierge we met and got our keys from was pleasant, personable, and seemed genuinely happy to help. The most memorable for me was when I stopped by the lounge for a late-night snack and locked myself out of my room, my then-girlfriend sound asleep inside. Even though it must have been about midnight, perhaps later, I finally decided to head downstairs to the concierge desk for assistance. With no issue and only a minimum of necessary questions, they printed out a new card for me and I was able to get back in immediately. My fiancee also managed to lose her wallet and camera while we were enjoying a whimsical time at DisneyQuest in Downtown Disney. By the time we realized it, somebody had already picked it up. The next morning room service called to let us know they had it. Downtown Disney was about a 15 minute drive away, but someone made sure they got it to the resort overnight and made sure it was returned to us. That's service. On our last day, I noticed that the ESPN grill nearby (pretty good food, by the way) had charged a meal to the room's tab instead of using the meal allotment. I took this to the concierge, mere hours before checkout, and they called the grill immediately and removed the charge, no questions asked. The room was fantastic. I'm no interior decorator, but it felt like it felt the theme of the resort perfectly, an idealized version of Atlantic City or Coney Island in their golden days. The beds were comfortable enough for me to consider actually purchasing some of the linens and give us the best night of sleep we've had in years. The balcony overlooked a quiet little garden outside the resort, and every night we could go out and watch the fireworks at Epcot. We got two queen sized beds, but that wasn't an issue because we were used to sharing a single twin. While I would have preferred a king, I understood that there was no way to ensure that we would get one and that it really wasn't necessary. Room service was a major factor for us. We could use our meal plans for it, and at the end of a nice long day, it was great to just relax and let the food come to us. The food was good, too. I think we played it safe and got pizza. The soft drinks that were included were nothing extraordinary, but the deserts were as ample as the entree and we rarely finished one in the same night. Due to the size of Disney World, no one resort can have an perfect location. Magic Kingdom and Downtown Disney were the furthest, but Epcot and the Studios were a brief, laid-back ferry ride away. There are a few fine places to eat nearby. ESPN Grill for the more Americana-inclined, Cat Cora's for Greek, Flying Fish for -you guessed it- seafood, a bakery, a pizzeria, and a pair of nightclubs that I can't speak to, being underage at the time. The lounge was great. Actually, it rendered some of our meals useless because of the offerings. While we didn't gorge ourselves, picking up a snack here and there helped keep us full, and the complementary soft drinks (including lemonade and iced tea) helped us slake our thirst in between actual meals. A few cordials, and coffee. A great place to just relax or pick up a snack when you have some downtime. If I had to complain about something, it would be the price. But I won't. Because a trip to Disney should not be a penny-pinching affair. It should be a time to spend an irresponsible amount of money to have fun. In addition, there is almost always some sort of deal or special event to allow savings. Around the time that we went, some of the rooms were going for nearly 50% off per night. If money's that much of an issue, spend ten minutes to figure out a good time to go for less. It doesn't have to be the coldest week in February. These deals were around in mid-August. I would complement the service, rooms, and food, for the experience I detailed above. If you've got the money, don't whine about spending it. If you don't, look for a deal or go someplace else.

This year Disney appeared to have mounted a disinformation campaign for paying guests.

Online check-in gained us perhaps 2 minutes in line (an accompanying colleague did not check-in online and finished at about the same time). We arrived on a Wednesday to find out that the only way to get park schedules for the following week was to call the Disney information line directly -- no one at the hotel or in the parks could tell us the schedule for the following week, and generally weren't sure of park hours for the current week. The phone in the room wasn't properly programmed, making things even more confusing. And, at the end of our stay, the woman I spoke with on the information line about baggage check-in and the Magical Express argued with me about how to pay for check-in luggage, and wasn't aware of what the printed material Disney sent us regarding baggage stated.

Previously, we\u2019ve stayed on property at a moderate resort, but on this trip we wanted to try a deluxe resort. After exploring all our options, we chose the Boardwalk because of its atmosphere and the proximity to so many other resorts and parks. We arrived very early in the morning to check in and went immediately to the online check in counter. (We had checked in on line before we ever left home!) We were greeted immediately by a very friendly cast member who had our welcome packet waiting for us. She explained the dining plan, gave us our keys and we were on our way within minutes. Our room was great \u2013 comfortable, nice size, plenty of closet space and shelf space, nice flat screen TV, couch, small balcony overlooking a courtyard. You could even see Spaceship Earth and the Eiffel Tower over at Epcot. The bathroom setup was very practical \u2013 two sinks with lots of shelf space outside the bathroom. In the bathroom was the toilet and shower/tub. With three adults in one room, this arrangement allowed us to get ready very efficiently in the mornings and still have privacy in the bathroom. The main resort pool was closed for refurbishment so we used one of the quiet pools. It was indeed quiet -- a simple, nice sized pool in one of the courtyards. It was all we needed for a cool relaxing dip in the pool followed by a warm soak in the hot tub after a day of playing at the parks. The Boardwalk itself is an enjoyable atmosphere. A few shops and places to eat. It\u2019s a nice place for a stroll. You can rent a surrey bike (quadricycle) and go for a ride around the lake. There\u2019s a dance hall and a dueling piano bar. All in all, a very fun atmosphere for a hotel. The location is excellent! From our room, we were a very easy 5 minute walk to Epcot\u2019s rear entrance right between England and France in the World Showcase. We were also about a 15-20 minute walk along a dedicated path to the Hollywood Studios. Just across the lake are the Yacht Club and Beach Club Resorts, along with the Swan and Dolphin hotels. You can even walk to one of Disney\u2019s miniature golf courses. Having so much clustered in one area provided many great things to do. We went to the Dolphin for dinner at Schula\u2019s one night. You could easily go to Beaches and Cream (an ice cream parlor) over at the Beach Club. And\u2026 if you want to save your walking for the theme parks, they run boats regularly between the resorts and theme parks at the Boardwalk. So you can ride to Epcot or Hollywood Studios and back (or any of the neighboring resorts). That convenience to two of Disney\u2019s theme parks and other resorts was a HUGE perk of staying at the Boardwalk! The only real downside to staying at the Boardwalk is the lack of a good counter service restaurant. There are plenty of good full-service options, but we often didn\u2019t want to spend that kind of money. And the proximity to two theme parks and other resorts means that you can enjoy their dining options with relative ease. But so many of Disney\u2019s other resorts have great counter service restaurants that offer a variety of foods and less expensive options than the full-service places. We missed that at the Boardwalk. That would be our only real suggestion to improve the Boardwalk \u2013 offer a good counter service place to eat. Because of that, there really wasn\u2019t a good quick and inexpensive place for breakfast or an evening meal. Sadly, there just wasn\u2019t enough time to enjoy it all. We never got to enjoy the health club or any of the restaurants. It\u2019s Disney\u2026 so went spent most of our days at the theme parks and other attractions.

He seemed more interested in telling us about his brother's employment than the room. When we first opened the door, we were hit with and extreme mildew smell. The air conditioning was on and the room was extremely cold. Pete left and we got settled. We discovered that garbage from a prior guest was left under the sink nad there was taffy left laying around on the floor. Also, the trim around one of the windows was hanging and bottom of the door frame was rotted. As we stayed in the room, the mildew smell was so bad we decided to call maintenance. The gentleman came and started a dehumidifier that stayed on the entire length of our stay. It's a good thing none of us need quiet when we sleep as it was quite loud. The mildew smell never went away. We made use of the concierge level food and drink and it was quite good. However, we stayed in the Garden Suites and the room for the food and drink was a distance away. As we were sitting around the pool at about 4:30pm, a woman entered our room. We thought she may be checking on the dehumidifier so we just stayed by the pool. When we returned to the room, it had been tuned down (including the sleeper sofa in the living room). Now this was 4:30. We had to fold the bed back up so we had somewhere to sit when we were in the room. Also, the 2 others that stayed from our party came to visit.

He went on to say that you have to be staying in a Club level room to enter the Inn Keepers Suite. Tehn he backtracked when he realized the time and said go ahead. We decided to go back to our room and visit. Our guests left and we went back to the Inn Keepers room for Dessert and Cordials and to see the fireworks. They were closing at 10 but there were still about 10 of us in the room. Pete came in and starting turning lights off and taking everything away. We felt rushed as did the other people there with us.

I thought that the hotel was a lot of fun and it provided great entertainment throughout the nighttime. But, there were some drawbacks to the hotel. Three years ago I stayed at the Moderate level resort hotel, Port Orleans French Quarter, I would stay there again before the Boardwalk. I say this because the room we received was a standard room but it looked so outdated, paint was peeling off of the walls, the bathroom was very tiny, the room looked like a value resort level room. I just felt like for the price we paid, the room would have been up to better conditions. Honesty, for anyone who is over 21 and traveling to Disney World, if you plan on spending all day at the park and just going to the hotel to sleep, just do the Value or Moderate resort levels. Also, the bus service for Boardwalk was VERY slow. Especially the Downtown Disney Bus. We stopped at one of the water parks and 4 hotels before we got to the Boardwalk. It easily took about an hour to get from Downtown Disney to the Boardwalk. The same went for the ferry to and from Hollywood Studios and Epcot. Boardwalk is the last stop on all of these. Honestly, I thought for what we paid, we would get more. Also, make sure to put the privacy sign outside your door! Right at 8:30 a.m. we had housekeeping knocking on our door waking us up!

Stayed first week of a 2 week break here. Because stayed in Disney first week; just went to desk in airport and were able to get the Disney bus to accommodation for free. We didn't drive for the whole 2 weeks, which is quite unusual. Benefits of staying in Disney - don't have to drive, free buses everywhere, early starts/lates in the parks so you get onto all the rides. Benefits of the Boardwalk - pretty high quality rooms, better choice of food (other than burger and chips), brewery with own beers, can walk to Epcot (5 minutes)/walk to Hollywood Studios (20 mins)/get a boat to both which makes a lovely change, also across lake to Yacht and Beach club, Swan and Dolphin at end of boardwalk to loads of different restaurants to try close by and a really pretty place. We didn't even take towels as there are free ones by the pool. As last time, the first week was magical; its like you are in another world. Would highly recommend the Boardwalk. The late night wandering round the world at Epcot I'd particularly recommend. We managed every Disney park from Sunday to Friday excluding Blizzard Beach. Before you go, plan exactly what you want to do. Get a guide book that tells you when its quieter on different days for each park. Work out which rides you want to go on. Get to the parks early and use FastPass to get on all the rides you want to. Don't bother queueing for ages unless you really love being in a queue - it really isn't necessary. Break up the rush with a water park or by a park in the morning, then back to the hotel for a rest/swim and back to a park for a late night/parade. Hotel rooms have everything in them. Staff were great when we needed them. Only issue was the bakery for picking up breakfast buns/croissants. Daft small shop where you had to get served so took too long. It can work out expensive, but staying in Disney even if just once or for a few days is worth it for the experience. When you stay in Disney, you get your room key and can charge your credit card to it - in effect you only need one card for your whole time staying in Disney - you use the key in the hotel bars, shops and in all restaurants and shops in the parks - even in Downtown Disney restaurants which aren't obviously part of Disney e.g. Rainforest Cafe.

Really thought for this price, we would have had a roomier room. The balcony looked out literally to a HUGE tree that hung over our balcony. No view. The Pool is the reason to NOT stay here. The slide is awesome and the kids liked it over and over again, but good luck to anyone attempting to find a lounge chair or anywhere for you to lay down your clothes so your kids can jump in. All the while, people starring at you as you search for even ONE chair. The chairs are really really close together. So if you are lucky enough to find one, you best like your neighbor. We witnessed 5 chairs near pool side with towels and flip flops on them. A random pair of sunglasses. These people did not sit in these chairs until 2:00pm, however the seats were saved since 9:00am. I swear they were at Epcot while they saved their seats. Upon their return, the seats went from the shaddy area to complete sun for their leisure in the afternoon. There is a sign up at the pool to not save chairs, so I know this is a major problem at this hotel. Once I did score a chair on our second day, I watch new people just checking in strolling out to the pool with the same dumb look I had the day before. I actually moved items from one of our chairs and welcomed this family. They were a family of 5 that had to share ONE chair. They were expected to be in the Hotel for the next 6 days, so I explained the drill to them. Get down there early and be selfish like everyone else if you expect to be able to sit and watch your kids so they don't drown in the the pool. Completely uncomfortable. Also found out they provide group rates and if the hotel is not completely full, they do provide discounts for the rooms. That was upsetting knowing we paid so much per night and the couple at the pool was paying $100.00 less pernight. Knowing that they offer discounts while we were staying there was a double whammy.

We went in January so the parks were not as nuts as in the summer. It was unseasonably cold, but in spite of that, we had a great time. The rooms were very clean, mostly quiet, and a decent size. We needed a microwave and the staff got us one right away. The concierge service was excellent as well.", "Date": "April 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island, NY", "Title": "\u201cFantastic stay in the perfect location-Disney's Boardwalk Inn\u201d", "Author": "need2travel2", "ReviewID": "UR60450406", "Content": "We stayed at the Boardwalk Inn from 3/26-4/1/10 & could not have asked for a better stay.

We also cut thru Epcot & took the Monorail to the Grand Floridian for dinner one night-it took a little while but was a lot more fun than the bus.

The bathroom had a tub/toilet area seperate from the doublesink area so sharing while getting ready is very easy. Our balcony was spacious & had a great view of a fountain & quiet pool, very quiet & relaxing. Our only downside was that it was a really long walk to our room from the lobby/Bellevue Lounge but we had a short walk to the quiet pool so it all evened out. The Belluevue was a nice place to have a drink before/after dinner, pretty room w/ a large balcony that overlooks the boardwalk & water. The themed pool looked like fun (we used the quiet pool) w/ a great waterslide. I've read reviews of people complaining about the lack of breakfast places but we didn't find that at all, for sitdown b'fast we ate at Kozzina's & for quick service we got from the Bellevue.

We were able to stay in a one bedroom villa due to the promo they were running where you buy 4 days and get 3 free. If they ran this promo again, we would consider staying there again (although it was not a perfect stay). I guess the best way to rate this hotel is to discuss what we saw as the pros and cons (see below). If Disney really wants to get this right - they should throw in a few Fast Passes with each standard vacation package (that would ensure I never even consider staying off property, as I am considering now). Moreover, I would absolutely consider buying a Disney Vacation Club (DVC)membership, if that was part of the deal. My friends and family have all said the same thing! Fast passes would ensure countless more DVC sales! We don't want Extra Magic Hours - we want Fast Passes!! Pros: - Walking distance from Epcot. - Villas are big and roomy - with kitchen area where you can cook a meal, if you wish. - Pool has a huge waterslide that my children adored! - Lifeguards were friendly and attentive. - Very clean rooms and property. - Boardwalk has live entertainment each night (street jugglers, etc...). - Many table service options on the boardwalk. - Washer/dryer in room. Cons: - Virtually no counter service available at this property, except a small bakery (i.e., no dinner counter service available). - Poolside bar closed early - no place to get a soda, lemonade, or something a bit more grown-up... - Poolside bar didn't offer any food at all (would be great if they offered chicken nuggets, hot dogs, burgers, grilled chicken sandwich, fries, snacks, etc...) - Concierege staff was the least helpful conceierge staff I have ever experienced at any hotel - Disney or otherwise. Sometimes, they were actually rude. I went to the desk about 4 or 5 times for help - only one person I dealt with seemed to have the \"Disney attitude.\" I finally stopped going there for help because I only left annoyed and frustrated and this was not how I wanted to feel on vacation. - The Disney Magical Express has some bugs to work out of the system. We only rec'd 3 of our 4 boarding passes. Then, we only rec'd 3 of our 4 necessary luggage tags. We were told by staff that we would need to get the other tag at the airport. In other words, we were told that we needed to stand in line at the airport and check-in, just like everyone else. This is our third time using the Disney Magical Express - this is the first time it has been this much of a nightmare. We wasted our last day at the hotel going from counter-to-counter trying to get the issue fixed (it was never fixed - we ended up having to check our bags at the airport even though we were promised the Disney Magical Express Service as part of our hotel package when we booked the vacation.) The hotel manager overheard and did end up sending us to the airport in a cab va. the bus, but it was really too little too late, at that point.

Two balconies, one over looking the garden and the other over the quiet pool, which my son loved as he was the only one ever in it. This was an extremely quiet part of the hotel. The location of the Boardwalk to the theme parks is #1 in my books. We were a five minute walk to Epcot, less than 10 minute boat ride to Hollywood Studios, and no more than a 25 minute bus ride to the other parks and Downtown Disney. When you stay at the Boardwalk you also have access to the pools over at the Beach and Yacht Clubs. They have sand bottom pools and a lazy man river. Very nice!!! Our theme pool at the Boardwalk was closed for reno's while we were there. We were here from February 4-11, and I highly recommend this time. The temperatures were cooler, (anywhere's from 58-78), but we still got a sunburn. But the crowds were very tolerable. No line ups for rides, with the exception of a few of the thrill seeker ones, which were only a 20 minute wait. But we went back on the extra magic hours and walked right on.

The area is akin to a company town so everything you do is Disney. Now to the hotel. Wonderfully managed, clean, although dated continues to maintain its' character. The weather was awful, cold, damp, and windy so there was little to do in the area. The hotel is convenient to Epcot only and the boardwalk area is essentially hotels and hideously overpriced horrible restaurants. The boardwalk area (at least in the winter) is pretty dull and the taxi rides are $15 minimum to anywhere close. I really don't have any criticisms of the hotel itself. I was forced to use the business center in the hotel and expecting little received less. The staff in the business center is rude to say the least. Frankly I am shocked that the hotel puts up with the Ikon franchise business center. To give you an idea of just one problem with them I was set to receive an early morning FedEx package sent by my office. Hearing nothing by noon I contacted my office. I was told that the Ikon business center at the hotel signed for the package at 9:30am. I contacted the business center with no success. Finally, at nearly 5pm after numerous calls I walked to the business center. The package was there in plain sight. The employee said oops and then wanted to charge me a handling fee. I complained to the day manager at the hotel who was professional and pleasant but that is the last I heard. One other note. If you want a taxi at the hotel you are on your own. Don't expect the bell staff to move to help you find one. After a day or so I just walked out to the taxi row and hailed one on my own. I guess if you are a family and want to focus on Epcot it is a nice location. If you are on business or attending a convention I suggest a hotel off the Disney property (only a few miles in any direction). I think that the hotel is used to dealing only with familes on vacation and not the business travelor. One important note, the main pool was closed for renovation and no one told us about it (not that you could use it anyhow do to the weather).

No one said anything about the extra magic hours either, even when I asked they said they didn't know. And there was no literature in the room explaining this stuff either. There are lots of little perks, but nothing tells you what they are. The room was very basic. There was a giant hole in the marble on my nightstand. The blanket was old and tattered. There was a brochure in the room about how you can buy the things in the room (like your bedspread, lamp, or disney themed bathroom items), but none of those nice things were actually in my room. Then at the end, they couldn't straighten out my bill. I wanted a bill that showed what I was charged at the hotel, and that I paid that (showing payment or a zero balance) so that I could be reimbursed from work. I just wanted a basic, regular statement, like I get from hundreds of hotels around the world. He told me the bill is really for them, not designed to be clear for the customer. I was disappointed at my lower price, I would have been downright angry if I paid full price. I stopped by the animal kingdom lodge.

Starting with the Disney attention to period details, the Lobby and other public areas were worth spending time to examine. As it was Christmas time, the Ginger Bread House was a fantastic display. The room was large and comfortable. If I were to make one observation about the room, it would be that it is impossible to view the TV from the sofa. That is about the only thing that I found strange. The service by housekeeping was as good as any I've had anywhere. We had a room with the basic view, but that was not a problem. We could see the top of the Tower of Terror and some of the lights from the Studios.

The Boardwalk itself a night is a brilliant place to be, lots to watch, pizza is cheap and tasty. Also you can walk round to the beach at the hotel opposite and watch the Epcot fireworks from there which is a lovely way to pass twenty minutes. We had some drinks in the bar - the service was lovely, measures were generous and a bit of free trail mix never goes wrong.

It's a short walk to the lounge from the cottage suites, but it was only a couple minutes away (including up the elevator). Would stay here again if we wanted to splurge - it was great for Jellyroll's and quick access to Epcot (we were visiting the food and wine festival), but the staff at all Disney resorts (including the value ones) are great, and we'd likely stay in value resorts like Pop Century on trips as well.", "Date": "October 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh PA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Trip To Disney and The Boardwalk Inn\u201d", "Author": "HeldonPittsburghPA", "ReviewID": "UR46887987", "Content": "Our trip to Disney World and the Boardwalk Inn was wonderful.

The hotel IS beautiful and the staff ARE friendly and outgoing but not really magical. Maybe I expected too much, but the overall experience was just okay for me. On a more practical and informative note, breakfast on the boardwalk kind of sucked. Room service was way to pricey. The Boardwalk Bakery was okay for coffee and pastries but the line was rediculous. Getting around to the parks, besides walking to Epcot, was easy by bus but a drag because the Boardwalk was the last stop on a weird circuit that included 3 other resorts with the bus making a stop at the other 3 resorts in both directions so at peak times the bus would arrive almost full from the other resorts and then go by them again on its way to the destination.

The hotel has a very comfortable, quiet atmosphere and is less \"high energy\" than other Disney resorts. You feel like you are in a stately mansion with fine furnishings, hardwood floors and top-notch attention. Two of the rooms we booked were the Garden Cottages and one room was on the fourth floor facing the garden. All were club level rooms. One of the nicest parts of splurging for the club level is that check in is a breeze at the club's fourth floor office while the family is treated to the snacks in the lounge. We were even greeted by name when we drove in and a wonderful gentleman was waiting to take us all up the lounge for check-in. Garden cottages are two levels with a loft containing a king sized bed and bathroom with large jacuzzi tub and separate shower. Beds were very comfortable. A small kitchenette was included with sink, refrigerator and microwave on the lower floor. One cottage housed one couple and two children. The sectional couch in the downstairs living room folded out into a large bed. The downstairs area also included a half bath. There was plenty of room for the children (aged 5 and 10) and privacy for the parents. The other cottage housed us (grandparents). Though very nice and near the grandchildren, I probably would forego the larger two story unit and get a regular room on the fourth floor as they are very nicely outfitted and closer to the club lounge (and I could avoid the up-down of the stairs in the cottage). The cottages are not separate buildings but rather the first and second level of a 4 story building. The cottages also look out onto the \"Quiet pool\" which was not used very much except for perhaps half a dozen people at the most. The club lounge was a nice place to gather and served a continental breakfast in the morning, snacks and sodas during the day, hot and cold selections, wine, beer in evening and deserts and cordials in the later evening. The staff was very helpful in making reservations. We also had the basic Disney dining plan which we found easy to use but also too easy to let accumulate until the end of the trip when we madly tried to cash in snacks and quick service meals. You need to pay attention or else you will have too many meals left over which is a waste of money. The Boardwalk is very convenient to Epcot and Disney Studios and there are lots of activities on the boardwalk. We enjoyed Jelly Rolls which is located to the lefty of the hotel and has talented guys singing and playing dueling pianos. Depending on the crowd's wishes the music could be modern, folk or country or a combination of everything. The main pool was a bit of a walk from the cottages and includes a water slide, which the children loved, however this pool is not as large as some of the other Disney resort pools so if you are looking for a resort with a pool with a \"wow\" effect this one isn't it.

The buses were frustrating, only because they stopped at the Dolphin, Swan, and Beach/Yacht Clubs before heading to MK, AK, or Downtown Disney. My husband and I spend most of our time at EPCOT/Hollywood Studios because, with no children, taking the buses to the other parks wasn't really worth the hassle, and after 1/2 day at MK and AK each, we'd seen all we needed to. One small, very minor complaint...the bottles they give you with conditioner make it very difficult to get the conditioner out...so if you use a lot of conditioner (like I do), I would recommend bringing your own or asking for extra as soon as you get there. Mousekeeping was good, no real problems with cleanliness. The cast members were WONDERFUL to us...check-in was a breeze, and every time we had a request, it was handled quickly and with a smile.

I was told by Disney staff that the Boardwalk is considered among the higher end of the Deluxe (so Wilderness and AK are lower end delux) and that meant sheets and towels with higher thread count and duvet's instead of bedspreads. Also more pillows on the bed than one can possibly use. The room was really clean - the only thing was lots of hair left in the bathroom - on the floor, in tub, in sinks on vanity top - strange but not enough to be be completely problematic.

This hotel did not offer the relaxed experience of the other two and we were a bit disappointed with the trip as it wasn't a good fit for us. My wife and I talked a great deal about it, trying to figure out why the two past trips were wonderful and the most recent one mediocre. I will share our insight into this hotel. It is important to mention, I think this is a terrific hotel and it simply wasn't a good fit for us, but I am sure some others might feel the same way. First, I will comment on the good aspects. This is a beautiful hotel, and I very much enjoyed the early 20th century theme. Our room was beautiful. We had a very nice view of the lake in a standard room, so we were quite happy. It is within easy walking distance to Epcot (walking was faster than the ferry) and has a ferry to Hollywood Studios. Now the aspects we didn't like. This was the nosiest hotel of the three we stayed at. The door was perhaps the heaviest hotel door I have seen, but we heard hall conversations readily. Between the hall and the boardwalk, it is not for light sleepers like my son. Our room was generally not cleaned until sometime between 1 and 3 pm, so as we have a three year old and returned for a mid-day nap, 3 days of the vacation were without maid service. We have never had that problem at the other resorts, and perhaps we were simply at the end of the list, but it was a bit annoying. Finally, the boardwalk is a mixed blessing. Unlike the other two resorts which have their own dining and shopping resources, the boardwalk inn and boardwalk are one unit. So whereas we previously looked forward to the much more tranquil resort after a busy day in the park, at the boardwalk inn, you don't feel like you leave the park. Some people might love this, but we didn't find it relaxing. Unlike most Disney resorts where the dining and shopping options are mostly for guests of that particular resort, the boardwalk is heavily toured by everyone, so the lines for everything are much longer than other resorts. While this should seem obvious by the hotel ads, it really didn't dawn on us that we would miss the quiet of the polynesian or carribean beach resorts. This is a wonderful location at Disney and a beautiful hotel. It offers a unique experience which is quiet different from other Disney resorts. I think if someone likes constant activity, it would be a great location. However, if you look at your Disney resort as a place to recharge after a day in the park, it probably isn't the best place.", "Date": "May 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wexford Ireland", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Experience of Boardwalk\u201d", "Author": "5dixiehighway", "ReviewID": "UR28699582", "Content": "Absolutely stunning experience with Boardwalk Inn - staff very helpful and great fun only downside was the cost of General Store on Boardwalk - a little too pricey for recessionary times!!

We had a room over looking the the quiet pool. I have only two compliants. The first was with the housekeeping. On the first morning of our stay the housekeeper knocked very lightly on the door and started to let herself in. This confused me because it was around 8:45 in the morning and the paper was still in front of the door. I usually throw my trash away but I missed a empty coffee cup and a empty bottle of water on the night stand one morning and these were not thrown away but the tip next to them was noticed and taken. Several days later our room was not cleaned at all; the towels were still on the floor and the beds were not made. I did call the front desk and made them aware of the problems. I vacation at Disney on a regular basis and Disney has always been the cleanest resorts and I have stayed at six or more resorts there. This might have been limited to our housekeeping staff member.

The size of the room was good (standard disney size) with 2 sinks outside the bathroom, small table, sofa and large queen size bed. We were also fortunate enough to have a balcony overlooking a courtyard. With a flatscreen tv and an ipod dock you could tell the room had recently been redocorated but the nice touches were the small mickey mouse's doted about - shower curtain, chair, lamp etc. There were no restaurants in the hotel itself as they are all located just outside on 'The Boardwalk' - 30seconds away, although you could buy croissants in the morning from the bar area. there are plenty to choose from (personal favourite is the EPSN sports bar). As with other Disney Hotels the there is the busses to the parks and water parks and your room key is also your park ticket and charge card at any shop and restaurant in Disney. Overall whilst the room was gorgeous this was partly to do with it being recently refurbished, the additional cost of this hotel above other Disney hotels is the location, it was great to be able to walk to 2 theme parks and around the Boardwalk area itself.

A couple of staff issues... the valets drove like maniacs... worse than we have seen... and we encountered one of them actually blaring the horn of a car he was driving at a family of pedestrians on the sidewalk (who had the right of way) so they would get out of his way and he could turn into the road.

A couple of mornings later, I had some business to do @ the concierge desk... and was \"helped\" by Debbie. I tried to cash a check and first she tried to dissuade me by saying, \"you'll have to wait, this takes a while.\" Well, she had difficulty getting an authorization for the check for whatever reason because \"it says it is no good\" (and kind of announces this to me as other guests were standing around). So I ask her \"WHO says it is no good?!\" We had a credit card number stolen a few years ago, so we get hyped up easily on this sort of thing. Well, not understanding what the problem could be, I pressed.

That's pretty much all the good I can say about the hotel. The toilet in the master bath was not working when we got in and had to get it fixed. The next morning we were awakened at about 7:30 a.m. to banging and relentless construction noise, hammering sanding, etc. I called down to the front desk to find out the problem and they said that they were sorry that no one told us they were doing construction/redecorating work. I told them that this was not acceptable. They said they would call me back after they investigated, I waited another noisy hour and finally called them back. I talked to the front desk manager and he said he would call me right back. Another hour later, I called again and they told me they were again sorry they didn't tell me that they were remodeling. I went out of the room down the hall and was choked by dry-wall dust. I went back to the room and packed my bags and found the concierge and told them I was done, get me out of here and left. They finally called me back about an hour later and agreed to move my family and I to the Contemporary Resort. They said they would move my bags. To make a long story short, they lost 2 of my bags and it took hours for us to get all our luggage. The \"club level\" option that I paid for consisted of really bad food and very little of it. No way worth the extra $1500 I was charged. Breakfast was tiny stale danishes, few cartons of yogurt, raisin bran, milk and some fresh fruit and juices. The rest of the day the hors doerves consisted of peanut butter and jelly uncrustable sandwiches cut into fourths with some potato chips and a few stale cookies. This was no where near what I was told would be available. I was also to have concierge service available. They did manage to book us one character dinner, but we were at a table off to the side of the main dining area and couldn't see the main part of the show. The other dinner reservations/shows I asked about they just told me that the restaurants were full. I went to one restaurant that they told us was full and asked for a reservation and got one immediately on my own for a prime 6:30 p.m. serving time. All the staff workers, housekeepers were constantly gathered up together in the halls complaining about their working conditions. We didn't even get towels after the first night. They came in and took the dirty towels and left us no fresh towels. The hotel location is hard to get transportation. We were told that the hotel was \"not more than a baseball throw\" from EPCOT. Wrong. The walk was much longer. The water taxis stop running around dark. Getting to any of the other parks is by bus and is slow crowded and difficult.

It's a quiet and beautiful property. Everyone is very friendly and helpful on property. It has an awesome pool area. We were always able to find some loungers by the pool. They keep the halls very cold, so bring sweaters. The restaurants along the Boardwalk are great, esp. ESPN Zone and Spoodles. We couldn't get in at the Big River Brewery, so we went across the way to a Yacht Club to the restaurant off their lobby. It was expensive and really not worth it. The service was lacking and the food had very little flavor. The parks were very crowded, which was to be expected during this time of year. I've been to Disney many times during summer and school breaks so I knew in advance what to expect. Disney really needs to add another park or more attractions to satisfy the crowds. We also visited Universal for the first time during this trip and found that Universal was less crowded and had more updated attractions. We paid extra for the express passes in advance thinking that they would be necessary, but they weren't really needed.

Our first impression of this resort upon arrival was it was nicely decorated. The front desk staff person was very helpful, as we arrived around 10 am and were able to check in. That was nice considering we did not want to wait until 4 pm to check in. The biggest benefit of staying at this resort is its location. It is only a 5 or so minute walk to Epcot and 12 minute walk to Hollywood Studios. This saved us so much time compared to waiting for a bus or other transportation. In fact, we tried to boat to Hollywood Studios and waited 15 minutes for the boat and it took another 10 minutes to stop at the resort. So, this is a big time saver. The resort This resort has nice landscaping. There are sitting areas around the resort outside for guests. It also has three different pools, with the largest one being the Keister Coaster pool. The kids loved this pool because of that reason, but the other pools are just as nice to get cooled off. The decor inside the resort is alos very charming and the theming falls right in line with the old time boardwalk of the East Coast. The room Our room (room 1342) was a garden view overlooking the \"quiet\" pool. This was an added benefit for us because we could easily go outside for a swim and be close enough to the room. Another benefit of the rooms here is that the seem to be larger then most other Disney resorts. Our room had two double beds and a sleeper sofa. The bathroom was large enough as well. The pools As stated above, there are three pools. The large pool is nice for kids and those who love water slides, but is a bit more crowded. It was least crowded after a storm had passed. The two other pools were nice but had no extra benefits for kids (ie. a slide). But they were less crowded and oftentimes you would be the only one there. Also, there were no lifeguards on duty. On Site Amenities This resort's feature benefit is its location. I could not say enough about having such a perfect location. Being able to walk to two parks was a time saver. At this time of year the parks are crowded and waiting for a bus or being crowded in the bus can make for some unhappy people. Plus, if you really wanted to get to Magic Kingdom you can easily walk to Epcot and take the monorail there. Our biggest complaint about this resort was its availability of dining services. Usually we get a mug because it works out well. However, at this resort getting a mug can be an inconvenience. You have to walk quite a distance and the dining areas where you get mugs close quite early. Plus, you need to wait for someone to fill it (it's not self service). Also, the dining establishments here do not make you feel as though you have your own exclusive dining like other Disney resorts. Although this is a problem, the food is spectacular. We ate at Spoodles for breakfast and it was very delicious. The portion sizes were also enough to feed more than one person. In addition, we did in room dining for breakfast the one morning (Family breakfast). This was meant for 4 people but it seemed like we could feed 8 or more people on it. The price was reasonable for the breakfast and the room service staff was very friendly. Overall Impression This resort has pros and cons and depending on your needs you should look at what it is you most want from a resort experience. We loved the fact that we were within walking distance to Epcot and Hollywood Studios. However, if you like having close dining within the resort, this is probably not the resort for you.", "Date": "August 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Providence, Rhode Island", "Title": "\u201cBoardwalk -True Disney Fashion\u201d", "Author": "job13ri", "ReviewID": "UR17902767", "Content": "We stayed at the Boardwalk during the July 4th holiday. We have stayed at several other Disney resorts and this one ranks up with the best. It's decor is based on the 20's - 30's Atlantic city hotels. The feel walking through the resort transports you back in time with the music played in the halls to the old radio shows that are played in the lounge just off the lobby. There is just enough \"Disney\" to add to your experience without being overwhelmed by it. We found it extremely comfortable and very clean. The rooms are adorable and very nicely sized. The beds were extremely comfortable. We had a nice balcony with a couple of chairs and a table to relax on. The cleaning service was immpecable. They provided all that was expected and more. The lobby is very nicely appointed with great models of an old carousel and roller coaster as well as the \"carousel horse\" chandelier. There is a great large back porch that faces the Boardwalk that has plenty of wicker rockers to lounge in and watch all the action on the Boardwalk. Our stay at this resort was fabulous. On the day we left we nearly had a major problem. One of the people in our party left her purse on the bench while we were waiting for transport to the airport. She did not realize it until we arrived at Orlando Int'l. No ID, credit cards and cash. Just as panic was setting in, I received a call from the hotels valet service (John) saying that they had found her purse. He assured us that he would have it delivered to the airport within a half hour. Noelle drove it over and kept in constant contact with us so we knew when she would arrive and where to meet her. True to their word she was there in plenty of time for us to get to our flight with time to spare. I had to beg her to take a tip since they had really bailed us out of a jam.

It was nice to fill up and then walk some of the breakfast off. EPCOT and MGM are within walking distance of the resort. You can take a boat to both but we found walking to be faster. We took buses to Animal Kingdom and Blizzard Beach. The Boardwalk is close so both rides weren\u2019t very long. We walked through EPCOT and took the monorail to the Magic Kingdom.

There was mildew on the ceiling in the shower that had not been cleaned. I think all the maids did while we were there where change out our towels and make the bed. The sheets weren't changed out once while we were there b/c there was a hole in one so that we were able to tell it was the same sheet the entire trip. The food was good however at the restruants that were on the boardwalk. At night time you can see the fireworks being shot off from the Magic Kingdom and Epcot. The bus rides were awesome b/c you are the first stop in the morning so the busses are always empty with plenty of seats and at night when you are tired your the first stop so you can get off instead of having to go to all the hotels. The pool was a very good size with a very fun slide. Also, you are within walking distance of Epcot and MGM. There are little paths to both which make it very convient. I would recommend taking these instead of the boats that can take you to each since those take so long waiting on passengers and stop at all the hotels. Its quicker to walk. We did have fun and overall it was nice. I'm not sure we'd stay there again since there are other hotels to try and we like trying different places.

First off, it is a gorgeous hotel that is extremely well located in the Epcot Resort Area. Well the exterior along the actual boardwalk is fine, it is the interior that really captures your eye. The attention to detail with the decorations is exceptional and reflects the trappings of 1920s American decor. Beautiful floors, furnishings, memorabilia and tapestries make the public areas really pop. The rooms are also spacious and well decorated, with plenty of closet and drawer space and two sinks on the vanity outside the bathroom. Our room had a small balcony that overlooked the first floor garden suites, but more significantly, the fireworks at Epcot, which made for a nice evening in. In general, the staff was great and the little details were paid close attention to for the most part (like the steady stock of hand towels in the men's room that could be \"borrowed\" for use as a head mop while out in the Central Florida summer heat! :o)) Unlike a fair number of WDW resorts that suffer from things to do outside the resort, BW is right in the thick of things on the boardwalk, with a handful of dining options nearby as well as the kitschy trappings of the boardwalk itself. Only a five minute walk to the World Showcase entrance to Epcot, it's nothing to walk or take the boat over to Epcot for a bite or a drink. One of the real gems of the resort is the Belle Vue Room bar located on the second floor of the Inn. A bartender who really knows how to mix and serve a cocktail works the comfortably furnished and largely quiet room just past the main lobby. It is a kids-free zone for the most part and was a really pleasure to retire to for a quiet drink at the end of the day. This is not to say that we didn't have a couple of quarrels with the BW. The main pool, which is generally very nice, is well removed from the Inn side on the Villas side and requires a march across the resort campus or through the hotel lobby. We would have used the \"Quiet Pool\" on the Inn side to cool off more, but there is no bar in the Quiet Pool area so our business went to the main pool. Signage in the complex could be better (lots of arrows pointing into the beyond with no reference markers to pick up the trail). Bus service can take a while because BW shares many of its bus routes with some combination of the Swan, Dolphin, Yacht and Beach Club resorts. And, unlike many other Disney resorts that are organized around some sort of central service node, all of BW's shops and restaurants and most of its amenities are located along the boardwalk and not really in the hotel itself, which can make a run for convenience items more of a trek than you might anticipate. Still, those complaints aside, we would very much recommend this hotel for a future stay at WDW. It is very comfortable, attractive and well located and the service is very, very good. While my wife tells me we need to experience other resorts at WDW, I know I would be very happy returning to the BW time and again on our future trips!", "Date": "August 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cDisney Boardwalk - Telling it like it is\u201d", "Author": "Following24", "ReviewID": "UR8107829", "Content": "Just got home from a 3 night stay at The Boardwalk Inn.

We ALWAYS stay in a Disney property because of the great bussing system and the little \"perks\" you get. We never have been able to convince ourselves to spend the $300+ per night just based on the location, but this time we took the plunge! Our expectation, based on reading the reviews, is that we needed to keep reminding ourselves that we were paying what we were paying for the location, not for a $300 room and the best service. I think that expectation was met. We arrived very late - 1am - due to travel delays. Like the previous reviewer, the checkin clerk was not at all friendly. He was very robotic and didn't make us feel welcome. This is definitely a departure from all of our experiences in the past. Almost always, regardless of time of day, the Cast Member makes you feel welcome upon checkin. But not this time. We had called in to request a king-size bed 5 days prior (the soonest you can do so at this resort), and of course, by the time of our arrival, they did not have any more. The clerk, of course, didn't mention this, so we were disappointed when we finally got ourselves into our room and there were two queen-sized beds. We called back to the front desk and arranged to transfer to another room the next day. This isn't the biggest problem on the planet, and it wasn't unexpected. This is one of the complaints we have about these very expensive Disney resorts - at most of them, you cannot guarantee yourself a king-size bed. We understand that Disney does not have enough king-sized beds to meet demand. However, at the moderate resorts, you simply pay a premium to guarantee that room type, and therefore there is no let-down at the time of check-in. We told the Boardwalk staff that we HIGHLY preferred paying a small premium for the room we want. They wouldn't say for sure, but seemed to think that the Boardwalk would soon offer king-size beds at that premium price. That would be wonderful, so that we don't have to transfer rooms the next day to get the room we requested originally. When we did go to the front desk for the transfer the next day, the front desk didn't seem to know about it and we were worried that they weren't going to get it right. But after lots of tense moments, they did get it right. ROOM SERVICE: We had toast, coffee and \"fruit yogurt\" sent to our room the next morning. The concept is lovely, as this level of service is not available at Disney's moderate resorts, where we normally stay. However, the toast wasn't warm at all, and did not seem toasted. Instead of butter, we were given margarine. And the yogurt was \"light\" which means that it has aspartame in it, and we do not eat aspartame because of the health concerns of these chemical sugar substitutes. We are definitely picky eaters when it comes to wholesome foods, so we didn't eat the yogurt OR the margarine, and called in to the food service staff. They said that they ONLY have the aspartame yogurt available at the resort, but next time we could request butter instead of margarine. They did credit us for the yogurt, but our final bill for four pieces of bread and coffee was over $20. So that was the last time we did the room service. RESTAURANT OPTIONS: As many may know, the value and moderate resorts have a \"mess hall\" as we like to call it - a large kind of self-service cafeteria. It's not a fun experience as it is always crowded and stressful. But it is convenient, and we missed this convenience at the Boardwalk. For breakfast, you basically have to eat at Spoodles, which is a sit-down restaurant. We were always able to get in without a wait, but I doubt this is the case at other times in the year. The breakfast was good and the prices reasonable, and we will definitely return there in the future. It's just that you might need to plan ahead to make sure you get in. HOTEL BAR: The hotel bar here is just a small area in the main floor, but very delightful. It was never very crowded and had a very great selection of cocktails. LOCATION: This was absolutely the best feature of the resort. You can just walk down the boardwalk and into the \"back door\" of Epcot. This convenience is SO GREAT. You can also do this from the Beach Club and Yacht Club resorts, and we hadn't realized this before, for some reason. The ability to walk to Epcot, and boat to MGM (or walk) was the best. The Disney bussing system is awesome, but the only thing better is not even needing to use it for two of the parks. You still need to ride the buses to the Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom, but the location of this hotel is absolutely wonderful. We had an overall good experience and will stay here again in the future, but the reason that it gets a 3 rating from me is that they need to step up the customer service at the front desk and pay attention to the foods they offer. I think that as people are becoming more and more aware of the dangers of chemically created foods such as sugar substitutes and margarine, they need to consider offering more wholesome options. My husband and I feel that we can't be the only ones who won't eat aspartame and don't want margarine.

This was our first visit to Disney. Let me start with the Magical Express pickup at the airport. This was a great convenience, but if you haven't been there before, be advised that trying to find the Disney Welcome Center at the airport was ridiculous. When you go to the lower level you will walk and walk and walk with no signs to let you know you are going the right way. And it was rather deserted, so you think you're not in the right place. Eventually, we found it. They took our luggage to the hotel - no problems. Check in was quick, staff courteous. As a matter of fact, I had read previous posts that said ask for a free upgrade - you might get lucky. We paid for a standard view room - I asked the lady at the desk & she told me they were filled up but she would give us a couryard view room. The layout of the Boardwalk is kind of weird & we had trouble finding our first floor room. After going down one stairway and going up another, we eventually found our room. It wasn't one of their newer rooms, but it was not old and smelly, as some others posters have had. It had double sinks, 2 queen beds and a sofa. My only problem with it was that the french doors that opened to the outside were quite thin, and the only lock was so chintzy I believe anyone could have kicked them in or at the least broke the pane of glass and unlocked the doors. I was not at all comfortable with the room for that reason, but when I called the desk they said they only had one room left in a very inconvenient locations far from the elevators. We stayed put. It was very quiet, overlooking the pool, which wasn't being used much considering the temps! As it turned out, the room was in a great location to the boardwalk & Epcot. Only you had to walk across the courtyard, up more stairs into the hotel lobby and then down stairs to get access to the boardwalk. There was no way to go directly from the room to the boardwalk. In retrospect, I think this was good considering the vulnerability of the room! Christmas decorations were up everywhere & it was just gorgeous! Not supposed to have been a peak time, but it was still quite crowded. Not much in the way of places to eat/drink in the hotel, but there are places on the boardwalk. The bakery & Spoodles is very good. We walked to Epcot, boated to MGM & bussed to M.K. Also took the monorail to M.K. - it's quite a walk to get to the monorail at the back of Epcot, but worth the ride. This is a GREAT week to go! Highly recommend going to the Candlelight Processional. Every restaurant we ate at was absolutely wonderful. MAKE RESERVATIONS BEFORE YOU GO! If you don't, you won't get in to the best places. Our favorite was Alfredo di Roma in Epcot (Italy). Food was fantastic and waiters (Hey, Davide!) delightful. They had an accordian player and the manager sings with him. They serenaded me at my table because my husband told them I'm Italian. So cool. Also, San Angel Inn in Mexico (try to get a table next to the Rio Tempo), Le Cellier in Canada, Coral Reef in Mexico - all had great food. Definitely go to the Prime Time Cafe at MGM - it's a hoot and the food is just like your mom made (really good & lots of it). To sum it up, I recommend the Boardwalk highly. Not sure it qualifies as a \"deluxe\" in my book, but I wanted a queen size bed so we had to go \"deluxe\". If we go again I would try the Beach Club across the lagoon. We walked over and looked around inside and it is very nice and has it's own little \"convenience\" store/bakery/souvenir shop. AND a great pool. Also, if you don't want to be around a bunch of noisy little kids, staying there in the Epcot vicinity is the place. Magic Kingdom was a nightmare of strollers and mobility scooters (watch out, they'll run you over if you get in their way!). One last thing - buy your tickets with the meal plan!! Food is very expensive & most everyplace is on the plan. We never paid for anything while there except alcohol. You had so much food you didn't need snacks in between meals.

The hotel ambience is really quaint and cute (old seaside theme), but the service is equivalent to a Days Inn or other motel, and the rooms were damp and frankly, pretty gross. I would've switched rooms as soon as I noticed the brown substance splattered all over the toilet rim, but since the bellman had already dumped all our bags in the room and left (we got lost trying to find it based on the front desk person's directions of: \"Just turn right down there\") I just sucked it up, grabbed some Purell wipes and wiped it down myself. Sorry, but for $300 a night, I shouldn't have to clean some stranger's diarrhea of the toilet. Anyway, the first morning we were there, my 60-year-old mother and I decided to take a walk on the Boardwalk. We noticed it was wet from being hosed off and extremely slippery. We discovered shortly thereafter that there is grease or motor oil from the vendors apparently, and they spray it down in the morning creating one of the most dangerous situations I can imagine. Needless to say, even being careful, my mom took a horrible fall. Luckily she didn't break a hip! I doubt she was the first person to do this, and I'm willing to bet Disney is going to open themselves up to liability if they don't rectify the situation. We're not litigious, and settled for their measly offer to reimburse my mom for her ruined pants (they were covered from top to bottom with motor oil/grease and even housekeeping could not get the stains out). Of course this \"offer\" came after several compaints to three different managers and about four phone calls. The $60 barely paid for my breakfast and wasn't even worth my time. What I really wanted was for my mother to enjoy Epcot without limping. The bottom line is that the service here is terrible. I called down to preorder (room service) breakfast for my daughter, and they refused. Said I needed to complete the breakfast order card and hang it on my door, which wouldn't have been a problem had the housekeeping staff actually left me one. The rooms are damp, smelly, and in need of updating and cleaning. There is rust underneath this rather protruding marble shelf in the bathtub my 2-year-old almost hit her head on a million times while she was taking a bath. I just returned home and can't wait to shower off.

This made it fairly easy to share the room with three other adults. We got very lucky because we were upgraded into the concierge floor so although we had a REALLY far walk to the room, it was worth it for the free wine, beer, snacks, breakfast, coffee, water ect..

Note: get off at Swan and walk back to the hotel - it's quicker! I had sent one of my shirts into the dry cleaner and somehow it became seperated (it was a shell with a tank & sheer cover attached). All I got back was the sheer cover and I was not happy. I got no where with the maid service on duty that night. Unfortunately I didn't discover this until the night before I was supposed to leave.

We have previousley stayed at Old Key West, Wilderness Loge and 2x at Port Orleans Riverside. The Boardwalk Inn cannot be beat for its location. We had 2 connecting rooms on the fifth floor 5291 & 5293. Our balconies looked out over the entrance to the Boardwalk and in the distance you could see Tower of Terror. The rooms were spacious and clean, the beds extremely comfy. The only downfall was that they were located near the elevators and you heard the motors of the elevators all night. We were a bit disappointed in the size of the main pool and it seemed to need a little TLC -- as compared to the other resorts. The quiet pool was perfect and never crowded. The parks on the other hand were extremely crowded and the extra park hours at night made them seem more crowded -- just remember the extra park hous are for everyone staying on Disney property ..and there are alot of people! We decided that the night there was EPH at Magic Kingdon we would go to MGM becasue everyone on Disney property would be at MK - this strategy actually worked great! One restuarant that we would highly recommend is Shula's Steakhouse in the Disney Dolphin. Themed after the Miami Dolphins \"perfect season\" this was our family's \"special night\" out dinner. It is extremely pricey but we felt it was worth every $. We spend one afternoon just walking from the Boardwalk around the lake to the Beach Club, Yacht Bluc, Disney Dolphin and Disney Swan. It was a great way to beat the crowds and gave us a chance to see what the other resorts looked like. All in all we would certainly recommend the Boardwalk for location, cleanliness and variety of restuarants available.", "Date": "August 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Boardwalk!!!\u201d", "Author": "irunnoft", "ReviewID": "UR5505777", "Content": "At first I was hesistant - especially after some of the reviews I've read on this website. However, a discounted rate for Florida residents popped up on the Disney website and we switched our vacation booking from the Wilderness Lodge to the Boardwalk Inn. I wasn't too sure about this move as I was already looking forward to the Wilderness. I'd already done my restaurant research for the Wilderness, traveling around there, and all the goodies that went with that resort. However, at a savings of over a thousand dollars and to move to a resort that would be considered an upgrade, I had to make the switch. As soon as we were dropped off at the resort by the Magical Express bus, all my worries and concerns disappeared. The outside of the resort is nothing spectacular, but when you walk into the lobby, you are greeted by a massive chandalier comprised of cherubs, mythical seahorses and pearls. It almost looks like a huge gold carousel, but it isn't. To say it is impressive is an understatement and you will most definitely crane your neck upward to take in the entire expanse of this marvel. Everything in the lobby makes you feel as though you stepped back into time to say Coney Island in the early 1900's. The furniture and appointments are sublime yet gorgeous. Not too ostentatious, but definitely ornate. I loved it! The staff were all very courteous and quite friendly. We arrived at the resort at about 11:00 am and one of the two rooms we'd reserved was ready, so we unloaded our carry on bags into that room and walked over to Epcot. Before I get into the proximity of this resort to the parks, let me just touch on the rooms. Our room was very tasteful and quite lovely. Again, I loved it. The theme of turn of the century luxury continues into the guest rooms with soft pastels contrasted against dark cherry furniture. Quite nice. There was a double sink w/ a marble countertop. The bathrooms were tiled as was the shower. The showerhead had about seven different types of spray (the one that really pounds you actually feels great after a looooong day in the Orlando heat!). The carpeting was rather thin and not super comfy, but it was clean, neat and in good condition. The air conditioner was very quiet and worked like a charm! The room was very comfortable and quite spacious, also. This resort also had the most comfortable beds I've slept on yet in a Disney resort. I don't know what kind of mattress it was, but it was absolutely heavenly. My wife also commented on what an absolutely wonderful bed that resort had. Prior to this, we've stayed at the Coronado Springs resort, which is my favorite of the moderate resorts. Our room also had a nice patio area with two chairs and a small glass table. We were on the first floor with a standard view room that overlooked a nice, quiet area between our wing and another wing. There were several trees and the area was well landscaped. We didn't have a view of a parking lot or anything objectionable at all! You can't beat this resort for convenience to Epcot. It is just a five minute walk down the boardwalk and then you come to a gate that lets you into Epcot in the World Showcase portion right near France. This is perfect for retreating back to your resort after catching Illuminations fireworks show during the evening. You don't have to fight the press for the front gate of the park. So, as far as Epcot is concerned, you can't beat this resort for convenience. You can also walk into MGM Studios from this resort, but it is a much longer, arduous walk (especially in Summer). I'm estimating it would be about a thirty minute walk to get from Boardwalk to MGM. However, there is a ferry boat that runs from the dock at the Boardwalk to MGM. The ferries run about every twenty minutes or so and the ride from Boardwalk to MGM takes about twenty minutes. Unless you want to work off some pounds, take the ferry, enjoy the ride and the AC! The back of the ferry boat is actually nice to ride on in the evenings! There is also a ferry that runs to Epcot from the Boardwalk, also. Here is the basic circuit that the ferries ran on while we were there. The ferry that picked us up to take us to MGM went from our resort to the Yacht Club/Beach Club resort (both resorts share one common dock) and then to the Dolphin/Swan (again, both resorts share one common dock) and then to MGM. For the return trip, the boat left MGM and went to Dolphin/Swan, then to Yacht Club/Beach Club and then to Boardwalk. If we'd stayed on that boat, the next stop would have been Epcot. So, if you catch the ferry from the Boardwalk dock to Epcot, there are no stops between the resort and that park. All that being said, I prefered the ferry to MGM over a bus ride to MGM. Animal Kingdom seemed to be the farthest bus ride away. There is only one central bus stop at the front of the Boardwalk and the buses also stop at the Dolphin, the Swan, the Yacht Club and the Beach Club. HOWEVER, and I felt this was a plus, every bus stopped at the Boardwalk FIRST. So, if you were leaving to go to the Magic Kingdom or to Animal Kingdom, Boardwalk resort guests were the first ones on to relatively empty buses. As the bus went on down the line to the other resorts, those guests found it rather difficult in the early mornings to get seats on the buses as they were generally arriving already close to full. The only downside to this was that the Boardwalk was always last on the list for the drop off on the return rides back from said theme parks. That wasn't a big problem for me because I'd rather have first opportunity to load the bus than last! The ride to the Animal Kingdom and Magic Kingdom wasn't too bad. It didn't really take any longer than it seemed to take when we took buses from Coronado Springs. Overall, I'd have to give this resort an excellent rating with regards to ease of transportation to and from the parks - especially the MGM Studios and Epcot theme parks. Now onto the resort itself. The Boardwalk is a neat resort! There's a lot to do at this resort and things really start to come alive out on the boardwalk at about five to six o'clock at night. The sun is beginning to wane, the temperature is somewhat better and it actually gets downright pleasant out there! There were a myriad of entertainers who were extremely lively and jovial! Everybody I saw looked like they loved their cast member position! There's lots to do and see on the boardwalk! From carnival games, to a traveling bicycle/piano player, magicians, jugglers - not to mention some of the carny games! You can rent a bike to pedal around the resort or even a boat to zip across the lake. Fun! Of course, the real attraction for the kids is the pool with the Keister Coaster. This is a 200' water slide made to look like an old wooden roller coaster. The slide dumps out of the mouth of a clown (scary!), but the kids LOVE this thing! My son went down this slide 45 times in a row if he went down it once. There's a nice poolside bar for adult beverages, but it also serves non-alcoholic drinks. The only downside to the pool was that there was no real food service near it. If you wanted, say, a burger, you had to go onto the boardwalk itself. No biggie, though! I didn't go to the pool to eat - I went to slide screaming out of a clown's mouth! We were there in mid/late July and the pool was busy but not over crowded. We had no problems finds chairs, tables, etc. There were also plenty of towels available poolside. The pool gets an excellent review from me! This pool does close rather early, though. It closed at 8:00pm, which I thought was early especially considering it was still light out until past 9:00, however there is a quiet pool that stays open until midnight. This resort had a game room in that it had a room (small) and there were about five games in it. It was really not very good, but it had some games my son loved. It had Jurassic Park III which involved shooting dinosaurs (right up an 8 yr. old boy's alley), Mario Kart and some Fast and Furious game. The games run on cards that you swipe. The cards are dispensed from a machine and you can always add money/credits to your card at any time. The good thing is that these cards work on any games in any resort. I took my son over to the Contemporary Resorts BIG game room and he played the same three games he played at Boardwalk! Go figure! There's much more fun, family oriented stuff to do than sit in a gameroom anyhow. Think Surrey Bike!!! For food, the Boardwalk is tops! Ok, so you've got the ESPN club on one side and that's a GREAT place to get wings, burgers, and similar fare. The atmosphere is awesome if you're a sports fan and there's always something goin on at the club. Also, if you're a guy, you have to check out the bathroom. I know, sounds weird, but hear me out here. Every stall had a flat panel tv hanging over it from the ceiling. There are also flat panel tv's by the sink. You can't miss a play even if you have to run to the restroom! How cool is that!! Can't say about what's in the ladies room, but I'd guess it was similarly equipped (maybe it had the all Desperate Housewives station running in there!!!). Had a great burger and fries at the ESPN Club and it was very reasonable. We never made it into Spoodles, but the food always smelled marvelous as we passed by the restaurant. The menu also looked yummy!!! Well..... not the menu itself, but all the food listed on it. However, Spoodles did have a walk up pizza window that was the bomb! One night we got back to the resort from the Magic Kingdom and my son said, \"Dad, I'm hungry!\" I was too - go figure! I took a quick jaunt out to the Spoodles walk up window and ordered two slices of piping hot pizza and some cold root beer! In less than five minutes, I was back in the room with the food and we had a little pizza party! The pizza is goooood, too. It isn't the same stuff you can get from the parks. This is REAL pizza! Lots of gooey, drippy, hot cheese and the sauce had just the right amount of spice to it. Magnifico!!! You can order pizza by the slice or by the whole pie there right up until 11:45 pm! The window closes at midnight. The real treat for dining is definitely the Flying Fish Cafe. I had a dinner of fresh scallops that was to die for. The Flying Fish recently won Best Seafood Restauarant in Orlando for 2006! Quite a feather in the cap of the chefs! The food is excellent and it is worth planning one night to dine there. The scallops are outstanding. The steak is also highly recommended. The food is very fresh and prepared to order. It was the most expensive meal from the trip, but also well worth it! You won't be disappointed if you dine here. As far as noise was concerned, my room was not overlooking the boardwalk, so it wasn't noisy. We did have some drunk people that came down the hallway making quite a bit of racket at about 2:00am one night, but that wasn't the resort's fault. They must've been coming from Pleasure Island or somewhere, but they were rude people who weren't considerate of other guests. You can find that in any resort. I was able to hear them probably more than I would've heard them in the Coronado, but that's due to the encloses hallways (whereas the Coronado has open air walkways outside the doors). All in all, I'm glad we didn't stay at the Wilderness, although I'd love to stay there and at the Animal Kingdom. However, the Boardwalk has just wowed my family with it's numerous amenities and conveniences. I'm afraid it has spoiled us for moderate resorts from now on!", "Date": "July 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cQuite Nice - Just make sure you have a car during your stay.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5466096", "Content": "I had the pleasure of staying in Disney's Boardwalk Inn for three nights over Memorial Day weekend. After booking a Garden Suite based on last minute availability, I envisioned the layout being similar to a normal two room suite you would find at a high-end hotel chain. Well, this is Disney, so I should have expected something different (but good!). A Garden Suite (more acurately referred to as a Garden Cottage at the Inn), is actually like a really nicely appointed two floor loft apartment (with a beautiful fenced in garden outside). You enter the room from the outside through glass french doors. Once inside, the first floor has a large sitting room, a wet bar area with fridge and microwave, and a 1/2 bath. After you walk up a nice staircase, the second floor loft area has a king size bed, and a bath area with large whirlpool, double marble vanity, and a spacious marble shower. My room was immaculately clean, and housekeeping did a great job keeping up with cleaning and turn-down service (loved the taffy!). There's definitely tons of space in a Garden Suite, and it's the perfect room for those looking for some privacy and quiet away from the rest of the often-times busy hotel. Garden Suites are conveniently located across from the quiet pool. They also allow you access to the 4th floor Innkeepers Club area, which has food presentations during the day/evening, dessert and cordial offerings at night, and anything you might need from the Innkeepers-specific concierge (reservations, questions etc). The only negatives for the room were shower noise from one of the two rooms above, and some room-service plates weren't taken away overnight after I called to have them removed. As far as the Boardwalk Inn itself, well, it's pretty much the perfect on-site Deluxe Disney resort. It has the best location (lots of restaurants and things to do right outside), it's gorgeous and classy, and it has some of the 'newest' (10 years old) Deluxe accomodations in Disney (aside from the newly opened Saratoga Springs resort). While Memorial Day weekend is a bad time to visit Disney World (extremely crowded), the staff at the Boardwalk Inn made my stay extremely pleasant. They went out of their way to help me when needed, and made my trip a memorable one. Traveler's Tips: If you can rent a car while at Disney World, do so. Disney's Magical Express works fine, but a bus is a bus. Plan on it taking an hour or so door to door each way, depending on when you get on the bus, what stop your hotel is, and if your departing terminal is A or B on the way back. Additionally, while the Boardwalk Inn is wonderfully located (next to Epcot and MGM), it is close to four other Epcot resorts who all share the same bus route. My bus ride back from Animal Kingdom was an hour-long nightmare that consisted of a long wait at the park, wheelchair loadings/unloadings, too many people, and too many stops. A car will get you to to many more places, much more easily, including: Downtown Disney, Fort Wilderness, the two Waterparks, and all the great restuarants located in other hotels, like Artist Point in the Wilderness Lodge. As others have said, a regular room at a deluxe Disney property is nothing more than a typical Marriott or Hilton room (but at a MUCH higher cost). Upgrade to a suite if you can - they're WAY more than twice the size and value of a regular room, and sometimes not more than twice the price. Check for availability - it's definitely worth it!", "Date": "July 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Inverness Florida", "Title": "\u201cNot the magic we were hoping for....\u201d", "Author": "clarkefam", "ReviewID": "UR5415478", "Content": "We were to check in the Boardwalk Inn for the last 2 days of June for the long holiday weekend.

I think by going to a Disney resort I made some of my own mistakes. I should have mentally prepared myself for the Disney life. I will say the first 2 hours at this hotel were a joke. We took the magical express in from MCO. It was a 20 minute wait which was not so bad. We got to the hotel and there were no lines for check in. I started checking in and based on other reviews I started asking the all important questions. How far are we from the elevator and do we have a board walk view? I was told we do not have a BW view but we have a pool view and we are not close to the elevators. The lady gave me a look that I only now remember. I wish she would have told me we were the furtherest room from the BW and the elevators. We walked to the room, it was about 300 yards from the lobby. They should offer gold cart service. We opened the door and a scent of smoke came out. The room was dirty and the people staying in it before us were smokers. The drapes were browninh yellow. I could not believe they were still hanging. We opened the door to see our pool view and saw the Swan hotel. Acually a construction site, it was impossible to see a pool. I called the front desk to get a new room and was told they could not move us for 4 days. At $450 per night that was not going to be the case. I was transfered over to the hotel manager. I spoke with him for some time before I told him I was coming to the lobby. We talked about how they advertise the web site and this room is not a fair representation of their site. He then decidied to come to my room to talk to me. I think he was worried that I was going to make a sceen in the lobby. (he was right) He came to my room and told me that he could put me in a normal room for $20 less per night with a BW view. I told him no. He really did not want to work with us at all. He also told me he has never seen the BW website @ disney(--)??? He finally said I could speak with the property manager as his arguements were lame and without merit. I spent no less than 45 seconds with the property manager. He said give me 10 minutes. He came out and explained he was going to bump a member to another room and give it to us. He said I must inspect it first to make sure we like it. I was blown away by how much nicer, cleaner this unit was. Now I see why there are so many one stars vs. 5 stars for this hotel. The first room we were in was a $175 a night room and the second was worth what we paid. That is why I gave this place 3 stars. To be honest, if we were placed in this room at first and did not have a 2 hour arguement with the staff I would have given them a 4 star rating. The location of this hotel is great, the boats come every 5 minutes for Epcot and MGM. The bus rides wait time can be 1 to 30 minutes. There are a lot of stops so be patient and prepared to wait.

We were in a \"garden suite,\" but the garden looked like an atomic bomb test site (gardens on either side of us were nice, 'though). We sat outside on our patio often, but the chairs were standard-issue molded plastic--very uncomfortable. The living room television was SMALL. And we encountered a cock roach in the living room while we were packing to leave. The linens (towels & sheets) were cheap and thread-bare.

After staying at other DVC resorts and other Disney resorts (Caribbean Beach, Port Orleans & Animal Kingdom) I would NEVER stay anywhere else on points (if paying cash we would stay at Animal Kingdom Lodge - it's wonderful). The only complaint we have is there is no food court like they have at many of the other resorts. The places on the Boardwalk are on the pricey side and our kids are picky eaters so there isn't much there at BW to please them. We love the quiet pool and the Keister Coaster (water slide). It's a very short walk to EPCOT which is nice because you're not fighting large crowds to leave at the end of the night - walk out the back entrance and have a leisurely stroll back to the hotel.

Disney Magic Express bus / baggage service was great / convenient / easy. Check in a bit slow with a newer person / but manager stepped in and helped. Extremely friendly bellmen - in a good way. First room was courtyard facing the Boardwalk - OK - but you want the Garden View which is what we had for days 2 - 7. Garden View allows you to see the Epcot fireworks every night - which is a pleasant diversion if you are there with a 2 year old who can't stay out late. Disney wake up calls had the same characters each day - a bit of a bummer. Our cleaning staff had a lot of fun arranging my daughter's stuffed animals each day - and even made her an animal out of a towel!!!! Our room was close to the elevator - but still very quiet. Balcony on both rooms could fit two people in chairs. Good Sprint & Nextel service (4 of 5 bars in room) in case you care. You can walk to EPCOT in about 9 minutes at a slow pace, and it takes about 20 minutes to walk all the way around the lake. The Boardwalk is the last prior and first boat back to / from EPCOT. MGM is two stops and about 20 minutes on the boat. On the buses, you can go direct from here to Downtown Disney, but it is two stops and 20 minutes to Animal Kingdom. We walked through Epcot to the monorail for Magic Kingdom. Elephant pool is big and the slide has one Very Fast turn at the end, so you can't put a kid lowere than 4 through it. Lifeguards were a little too aggressive in safety for me, but no one else minded. The kiddie pool is small with room for maybe 6 kids comfy. The separate Quiet Pool in the Garden View area is nice for sunning with a hot tub, but deep so no kids play there. The play area does not have swings, but nice slides and climbing. Fitness area is comprehensive and relatively large for the size hotel - never had more than two people in there with me. I recommend the Beach Hotel character breakfast with Goofy / Minnie / ChipDale (convenient, good selection especially fruit), the Brewery restaurant on the Boardwalk(fantastic tastes, reasonable prices), and ESPN Zone (as long as you tolerate the very LOUD environment). We found the Boardwalk restaurants Flying Fish and Italian/pasta one very expensive for the small portions, and not really that unique in taste - skip them. In the Magic Kingdom, the Crystal Palace character dinner was fantastic with Pooh / Piglet / Tigger (plus dancing), and very tasty. Otherwise nothing really stood out great or bad. The Boardwalk has a small general store with reasonably priced milk (2%) / beer / wine / liquor / snacks / soup but not much else. We supplemented with an online order from Goodings supermarket. A Disney vacation is always nice, and this was no different. We found a Disney hotel to be a HUGE benefit for access / enjoyment, but pricey - it will a once in a while trip for us.", "Date": "November 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cAn adults paradise\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4003714", "Content": "This is a place that I dream of living in all the time, a place that I can explore and marvel at its treasures, a place where serene is sublime, here you can live out a fantasy of life on the boardwalk and walk directly into EPCOT center.

The room was on the side of the hotel where Spoodles is. In fact our room was right above it. I know people say hotel rooms in Disney aren't that great, but it is what it is. All we did was shower and sleep there. Not bad, but the decor is not my style. Beautiful view and you could hear the ferry horns. Stayed on concierge level, which I would recommend if you have kids. We would have breakfast every morning before heading out. In the afternoon we would go in for snacks. At night we would go for cordials or a snack before bed and always they would have milk, soda, etc available. The only down side was that it seemed that the rooms were far from the pool and far from the lobby to catch the bus. Not bad if you are walking alone, but when carrying a sleeping child, far, far, far. All in all, I would stay here again, because the night life on the boardwalk was nice, and you can walk to Epcot.
