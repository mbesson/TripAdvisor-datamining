The only way to control the temperature in the room is to open the window and it is extremely load outside even with the window closed. The staff was also very rude.

Room not made up until mid afternoon. \"Breakfast\" (included in advertised price) was minimal - either a croissant or a muffin and a paper cup of coffee - served in a bland basement, where there were more bedrooms. Reception staff a motley crew of rather informally-dressed men, but helpful enough. Hotel entrance most uninviting with very tatty carpet running up some steps to an uninspiring reception area.. On arriving the bill was immediately presented to us for settlement. The area was teeming with students and young people of every nationality. many frequenting the plethora of lively, noisy caf\u00c3\u00a9s. Strip joint next door.

We had a room with a window to the street - no chance to sleep with open window - there is a noise from the street during the whole night :) The hotel was quite good for the price, no problem about it - but I was travelling with my friends (20-22 years old), so we don't have high expectations. As for the breakfast, it was horrible - a choice of a croissant or a muffin + a hot beverage, that's it.

After emptying the car & parking it approximately 1km away, we proceeded to our 120-degree room. Being that the temperature in the hallway was about 70 degrees Fahrenheit, we were mildly upset. Upon learning that, our front-desk concierge busted his behind to find us a couple of creaky, yet functioning fans. While sweating the night away, we were entertained with the blaring guitar from the bar below our first-floor room, and the thundering bass of the strip club next door, until about 3 AM. The next day, we happily moved to a room upstairs (which did have a 20 degree temperature difference, for the better). It had a flat-screen TV, basic cable, and a surprisingly clean carpet & bathroom! The experience the night before left us wondering about a change, but it worked out for the better. The only downside, was a couple with an obvious drinking problem staying in the room next door. Their incessant banter was a source of great whimsy til about 4AM or so. In a nutshell. The hotel was adequate. If you are a family, stay out of the Latin Quarter; unless you are a family of drug-peddlers or want to start a rehab clinic.

It was surrounded by shops, cafes, restaurants. Walking distance of old Montreal and China Town, among other places you are likely to visit if you are in Montreal for sight-seeing/atmosphere imbibing. The Cafe (separate business establishment) practically downstairs is a no-frlls place but has charcahter. We had great crepes here for brunch and reasonably pried beer at night. For the fact that it was in heart of a lively area did not mean, however, that it was a loud place. We had 3rd floor rooms at the back of the building: we found the place absolutely quiet at night. The bed, a double (not queen) was firm and comfortable. A comforter would have been nice, but the combination of a fleece blanket and the bed-spread on top was warm and comfy enough. At $75 a night for double accommodation for a weekend, with breakfast (even if very basic), I thought it was good value for money. Parking was available at an independent Parking-lot behind the hotel for $9 per 24 hrs. On the down side: this is not a shiny, new hotel like the chains like Delta. It has no elevator (for people with disability/heavy luggage this might be a concern). The place was well-cleaned, but the up-keeping could be a shade better: hairdryer was functional but with the back coming lose, the shower-curtain was getting to be a bit moldy at the back, the towel-rack was missing the rod.

Was notified at that time, although guaranteed parking at the hotel, that we would be parking a block away in the public underground parking in the library for 10$ a day. Once we brought all our luggage into our room, which smelled of musky, stale smoke (we had to spray perfume, open a window and turn on a fan in order to get rid of the smell), we went to park our car and walked back to the hotel. As we were walking to our room, the front desk clerk (and owner, which we later found out) rudely informed us that we should respect the other patrons of the hotel and not be loud or we'd be kicked out. We found it extremely disrespectful considering the only reason he said this was because we were three young girls (20-22). We got to our hotel room to find that we only had 2 towels so we went down to ask for one extra as there were three of us, and he reluctantly gave us an extra towel. Every time we would leave the hotel, whether it was early in the morning for sightseeing and shopping, or later at night for dinner and dancing, the front desk would always ask us which room we were staying in, which we found to be a little odd. We didnt think much of it. On our third day at the hotel (new years eve), we arrived at the hotel after sightseeing to the police at the hotel. We later found out that over 1000$ worth of items and money had been stolen from a room on the same floor as us. The hotel does not provide safes and does not use swipe cards for their rooms. We are provided with one key and the extras are all with the hotel staff. The owners denied having any involvement in the robbery, and refused to let the police search the housekeeping or owners vehicles or property for the stolen items... a little fishy in my opinion. The hotel staff, aside from one individual who worked the overnight shifts, are crooked and give horrible customer service. Not once did we feel welcome. We will never be back to this hotel and I hope you will chose another place to stay during your visit as well. Their staff are not trustworthy and completely ruined the one groups (who's property was stolen) new years and trip, along with ours. The fact that they asked what room we were in when we LEFT our rooms, random phone calls/hang ups late morning and early evening to see if we were in our rooms, etc... it all added up. DO NOT VISIT THIS HOTEL WHEN IN MONTREAL!! It may seem like a good deal at the time, however, I'd STRONGLY advise against it.

We wanted to spend a weekend in Montreal, but without breaking our budged: I believe the price I paid was $76 plus taxes. I have to say \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if you value your comfort and you want a big room with a big bathroom, this is NOT the place for you. This hotel must have the smallest rooms I have ever been in, though it was clean. It looks more like a hostel. I personally didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care so much for the furniture, or TV, or for any of the other little things, as I was there just to sleep, not to spend my day. It is a very modest looking place though!! The breakfast was little but OK, though I could see how this is not enough for a guy. Also, the eating area was pretty poor looking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c yet, I would not hold this against it. The pluses: the hotel is located close to many clubs and bars, and for young people this would be an ideal location. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care much for most of those clubs, but the hotel is in walking distance (maybe a 20 min walk) from the more upscale clubs and restaurants. So if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want the hassle of finding a parking place in downtown and just ride the subway, returning to the hotel late in the night won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a problem. Also, I would list the price as a plus. The staff was helpful, and we had no issues. The minuses: because it was close to so many bars, it turned out to be a very noisy location too. I mean, extremely noisy, because I am pretty tolerant myself. The parking could be an issue in the winter. We parked a block away, in the garage at Cegep Du Vieux Montreal which was I believe $15/night. There are cheaper options, but these are not covered parking lots, which may be an issue in the winter. And obviously, if you are all for comfort you will be a bit disappointed about this place. For instance we had to ask for towels because there weren't enough.

True, that this isn't exactly your Ritz Carlton, but remember that you get what you pay for. Don't expect a five-star hotel for $80 a night. It's basically your no frills hotel. Would this be a good hotel to bring the family? Maybe not. Is it a good place for young people to stay to save a couple bucks so they can party harder in Montreal? Absoutely. For a couple of young guys in our 20's, we had a memorable time in this hotel. Being on St. Denis, it's close to many popular restaurants, clubs, and bars. Interestingly enough, the hotel is right beside L'Axe strip club. That may be a good thing for some of you boys out there. It's also close to the St. Catherine scene (if you know what i'm talking about). And for those who like to party crazy until the sun comes up, Aria is just right down the street--the hotel is in a perfect location to stumble in for a late morning snooze. As well, the hotel is within reasonable walking distance to the popular St. Laurent club and bar scene. The hotel is crammed with many young money conscious people. So if you're looking for a couple of guys or gals to party with, this could be the place. There were a few negatives about this place: - First, the parking situation at the hotel was less than ideal. I did not trust parking my car behind the back alley of the hotel. Parking was very cramp and would only hold about 8-10 cars max. The parking was also very incovenient. You basically had to walk up to Ontario St. and then make your way down St. Denis to the hotel. - The rooms in the hotel are very small; however with some creative rearranging of the furniture, our standard one bed hotel room was able to house 3 guys and 2 air matresses. - Third, our hotel room had a really funky smell to it. The smell was so strong that I was able to notice the noxious odors while I passed out after a night of heavy drinking and partying. - Finally, the wake up call system was non-existent. We put in a wake up call for Sunday, May 21, 2006 at 11:00am and to this date we're still waiting for it; they never called. As well, there are no alarm clocks in the room, but thankfully cell phones have alarm clock features. The Latin Quarter definitely has some character to it. If you're looking to have a good time in Montreal and only need a hotel room to sleep, get intimate, and house your personal belongings, then this is the place for you. Montreal is a fantastic place with all its history, culture, nightlife, and most importantly, its dark-haried French beauties. It's a top-notch place to unwind and have a great time. When in Montreal, there's no need to be uptight. It's a great city and when you're having this much fun with all the things to do here, the hotel should be the last thing on your mind. Yes, I may have noted more negatives than positives, but I think this hotel rocks!

Don't believe them!!! I'm 23 years old and have travelled extensively through Europe. If you are a young, budget traveller and have ever stayed in a hostel or pension, this place will make you very happy. It is rediculously cheap too. The location is amazing, especially if you are going to be going to nightclubs. We walked everywhere. I personally was extremely pleased. The staff was very helpful and spoke English. The towels were thin and scraggly but who cares, you are getting a budget hotel because you have no money, if you require plush towels then pay to stay somewhere nice, it doesn't take a genious to figure that out. The room was clean, the bathroom was clean. Since everyone is so hair obsessed on this site, here's what I have to say: There were 2 brown eyelashes on my pillow. I plucked them off the pillow and ate them because who cares about a couple of hairs?!!! You won't die. You won't even get sick. You won't get a disease. Brush them off. The sheets were obviously clean because they smelled like a fresh spring day. The room was BIGGER than expected. I was so inspired I hung up my clothes in the closet and put my socks in the drawers. I never do that. There was a TV. There was a hair dryer. There was soap. That is all you need. My girlfriend who is deathly afraid of bugs, hairs and stains and who refuses to stay in hostels was totally fine with this place. Not a complaint at all from her and that says alot. If you are an conservative adult who is used to staying in big chain hotels and never roughed it in your life, or you are the kind of person who demands an entirely new burger at a restaurant because they accidently put tomatoes on it and even if you take them off \"there's still a little bit of juice on it\", or you used to tell the teacher when people cheated when you were in high school, or you correct people's grammar during ordinary conversation, or you home school your children... then don't stay here. You are obviously very uptight and picky. Go to the Holiday Inn where you can get all that complaining out of your system, snidely acting like a big shot when you tell the manager you are going to \"contact the regional offices about this.\" Hotel Quartier Latin is $60 Canadian for a room, are you nuts, what do you expect??!? Obviously this place isn't worth a 5. I mean its a 2 star hotel. But really, I was generally impressed by this place for the price. We got a double bed room for $74 Canadian. 2 couples sharing the room, we $20 each a night for our stay and loved every minute of it. PS- Budget minded, relaxed adults don't think that this is a \"party hotel.\" It was actually extremely quiet as well!! PPS- If you are under 25 years old and have a problem with this place, it's time to learn to \"chill out\" a little bit. COOL TRAVEL TIP: In this hotel, there is no stereo in the rooms... But the TV has auxillary inputs in the front. So, if you bring your iPod and the cable you use to connect it to a stereo (headphone jack to red and white plugs), you can plug that into the front of the TV and use the TV's speakers as a stereo!!

Admittedly, the room was not as clean as it should have been -- there was hair in the shower and on the bathroom floor, and I'm still not sure what the smudge was on the toilet roll dispenser but I'd rather not think about it. But we were having such a good time we decided to let this slide, and booked again for July. What a mistake. I phoned in June and made a three-night reservation for late July. I received a confirmation number over the phone and assumed all was fine. When we arrived, everything again was fine, and I filled out a (completely blank) check-in card with my address, license plate info, etc. All seemed well and we settled into our very small but adequate room for two uneventful nights. There was a refrigerator in the room, great for my husband's medication, and the room was reasonably clean. On the morning of our third night, however, the problems began. The day clerk told us upon returning from brunch that he'd expected us to be out at noon. I explained that he was mistaken and we were reserved for three nights, and he said that was wrong and we would have to leave the hotel. I dug out my confirmation number and personal notes indicating the correct dates I had requested. The clerk, who had no real evidence to the contrary, attempted to convince me I had agreed at check-in that we were staying only two nights and that I had written it on the check-in card. This card was blank when I filled it in, and after the fact he had written in the dates to turn on and turn off the phone -- not real evidence at all. He then told me outright that I must be mistaken about the reservation because he would have tried to charge me $174 for the Saturday and not $89 as he had the previous two nights! Apparently there is no system for writing down reservations at the hotel with accurate information that he could show me, despite the fact that I had a confirmation number handy. The clerk attempted to call, or pretended to call, the hotel manager twice to discuss the situation and eventually said that he'd handle it himself since the manager \"probably wouldn't be as nice\" as he would. (?!?) His \"nice\" solution was to have us move rooms (why??????) and charge us not $89, $89 and $174, but rather $109, $109 and $109 for the three nights. Since I was reserved for $89, $89, and $89, I was put off to say the least. But since my husband is ill and we hadn't the time to reschedule anywhere else on a very busy night (with Gay Pride right behind the hotel -- hmm, do you think they were hoping we'd leave so they could get a better price?) we agreed to let the hotel charge us an extra $60 *just to continue staying there when we were already reserved*! Then we were not allowed to stay in our room since it was \"rented\" already, and were moved to a larger, much dirtier room! This room had no refrigerator, had black scuff marks on the wall next to one bed, hairs ALL OVER the sheets of both beds, and the bedside lamp was broken. It was an inexplicable and inexcusable \"solution\" to what was in the best case a mistake on their end, and the room was definitely not worth $109 no matter how busy a day it was. The clerk also tried to get me to pay him in total up front numerous times, despite having my credit card on file and my insistence that I would pay my balance in cash at check-out. Perhaps this was because he knew the next day's clerk was exceedingly bad at math, even with a calculator, as another reviewer mentioned. This actually worked in our favour as he failed to overcharge me *quite* as much as the other clerk had intended. I also complained at check-out about the dirty sheets and the clerk seemed confused and embarrassed, and when I mentioned that the lamp was broken, he just said, \"I don't know anything about the lamp.\" Add us to the list of \"never agains\"!", "Date": "August 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cI should've taken pictures of the icky\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3650621", "Content": "If I had known I could post pictures to this site I would've taken photos of: 1) The supposedly \"clean\" sheets which were covered in human hairs (well, by covered, I counted 18 different hairs). 2) The brownish/greenish/yellowish slimy mildew on the lovely, forest-photoed shower curtain. 3) The weird stains on the carpet 4) My boyfriend's face covered in white pills of cloth from the translucent towels. 5) The tacky picture that was fastened to the wall in an incredibly crooked position. 6) The look on the staffer's face when I asked for new sheets (not nice). 7) The cardboard bed. 8) The yellow stains on the pillows. 9) The bag of Fritos left behind from the last occupant. Overall, I don't expect much from a one-star hotel...but to me one-star is like a Motel-6. All i ask for are clean sheets, clean shower and a halfway decent mattress. Not here! First, there is no parking so be warned that you're going to have to park a block or so away which is about 40$ for 2 days. So it'll be worth spending an extra 40$ for a better hotel with parking. Second, expect to wait 25 minutes for someone to come to the desk to give you your key. We even tried calling the hotel from the front phone... the other phone just rang and rang and rang... Third, When dragging your luggage in, don't expect the staff to open the door for you. Instead, just let them watch you struggle. Fourth, When you ask for clean sheets, don't expect concern or even sheets right away. I got the inquisition even after I showed the guy all the hairs. He kept pointing to the creases telling me that was proof that they were clean. Fifth, you can't cancel a reservation completely. If you do, your cancellation fee is one night. You also have to give 48 hours notice. We wanted to cancel our 2nd night and were allowed the option of paying and giving up the room...even though they were sold out and could've sold it.", "Date": "July 9, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cThe worst experience of my life!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3606819", "Content": "This place is a dump!

Although my floor was technically the 4th floor, the 2nd floor was actually street level and 1st floor the basement, so I only had to haul my luggage up 2 flights of stairs. I found my room adequately clean, basically furnished and ok-sized, given that this is a budget, European-style hotel (i.e. small rooms and few frills). At least I could move around the room without having to worry about banging my arm or feet against something. My room was at the back of the hotel with a view of the back alley and some parking lots beyond, but I did manage to get a glimpse of the fireworks on Saturday night when the International Fireworks Competition was active. The TV with cable channels was quite well sized for the room, probably 21-inch. The rationed breakfast was available in the breakfast room during the short time frame of 8-10am, and I never bothered to eat there because of the wealth of cafes and breakfast places immediately outside the hotel. Parking is available in a parking lot 1-2 minutes away by foot, but the price varies from free to C$10, depending on how busy the hotel is and who you speak to. Basically the hotel maintains a couple of monthly passes at the lot which they then give to guests. I stayed during a busy weekend (much of the Latin Quarter was pedestrianised for the Francofolies festival) and paid C$7 per day for the parking. The staff can be friendly, but the guy who did my bill was lousy with math (even with a calculator), so check your bill carefully. The biggest selling point of the hotel is the location - close to the UQAM subway station and the Central Station for trains, and right in the middle of the Latin Quarter on rue St-Denis.

It's surrounded by lively restaurants - there's a great vegetarian buffet across the road, and Italian, Thai, pizza, Chinese etc just a few doors away. There is a university in the area, so there are lots of people out and about till quite late and it feels quite safe. It's toward the fringes of the restaurant area, so the rooms are quiet. It's very easily walkable to Old Montreal and, if you like walking a little further, to many other great areas. Although there's no parking onsite, it's only one block away from a major subway station. The subway will take you around town and to all major tourist attractions, and also to the shuttle that goes to the airport. The rooms are small, but adequate, and have a small refrigerator. The views are of the surrounding streets etc, but if you're going there for the location and price, they really don't matter! The tvs only have basic channels, so plan to see Montreal while you are there! Breakfast is simple, but nice, with croissants, muffins, various cereals, juice and coffee, and they will try to give you as much as you can carry! CONS: There are no laundry facilities, however we were told that there was one nearby if we needed it. There was also no iron available, so bring non-wrinkle fabrics, but they do provide drawers and hangers. If you like thick toilet paper and towels, bring your own, but they will happily provide more if you need them. Next door is a strip club, but it has pleasant security guys, you can't see in, and the rest of the area is nice. It never bothered us, however if you are taking your family and don't want to explain what it is .... In conclusion, this is a great budget hotel (we paid approx CA$70), in a lively and convenient location.

After 7 hours of driving and just wanting to get settled, I arrived and was told I had to drive around crowded city streets and try to find an open lot with space. I never saw any sort of breakfast.
