This place is great - fantastic location and reasonably clean rooms. I preferred the 6th avenue location as it was closer to the subway station, though there are more food places at the Annex. The only 2 complaints which I have are that 1) there is no elevator to the 4th and 3rd storey of the 2 locations respectively, which makes luggage carrying very challenging and a great workout, and 2) the shower did not really work very well at the Annex, though they can be overlooked given the great value.", "Date": "October 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tokyo", "Title": "\u201cWould definately use this place again!!!\u201d", "Author": "hielo55", "ReviewID": "UR65291178", "Content": "As you all know, accomodation in New York could be a bit too pricy, especially if you're planning to stay for a long period of time. So, when I found this place, I thought I'd give it a try. The location is GREAT! There's a subway station near by. Using the bus was also another great option for me! There are plenty of places to eat. There are also grocery stores around the neighborhood. There is a small kitchen. Can't use the stove/oven but can use the microwave for cooking. The bathroom has a shower booth, which may be a bit small if you are big... I stayed in February. Experienced snow storm while I was there. Was very cold out side, but was very warm inside. It was nice coming back to a very warm room!!! If you're hoping for a HOTEL class experience, this may not be the place for you. But if you want to experience New York, this might be THE place to stay. What else do you do than to take a shower, get some sleep...? You're out enjoying the city most of the time!!! I enjoyed the nightly conversation I had with the other visitors, something you can't have if you stayed at a hotel!", "Date": "May 25, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "NY Oyado", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d1497821-Reviews-NY_Oyado-New_York_City_New_York.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">823 6th Ave</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New York City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NY</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1497821", "ImgURL": ""}}
