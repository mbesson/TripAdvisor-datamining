I now regret not consulting this website's reviews before deciding to book there. Although we didn't see any of the infamous cockroaches my wife spotted a \"roach trap\" placed in the hallway so clearly they do have \"roach issues\"! We had a room out the back below ground level which was small, dark and smelt of stale cigarette smoke. The bedsheets were ingrained with the stench of cigarettes and my pyjamas still stank when I got them home the following day. What's more we had an awful night's sleep because some inconsiderate residents were moving around and opening and closing doors at regular intervals throughout the night, and there didn't seem to be any staff around to do anything about it. The shower was good for 1 shower's worth of hot water and then it went cold.

So I read some of the other reviews on here before checking in but I still checked in, optimistically. I really wish I had not bothered! The room was small but I could cope with it as it was just me - that was until I sat on the bed and was thrown to the other side of the room. The bed was on wheels! To get to my room I had to walk down some metal fire-escape type stairs which when I returned from dinner were wet (it had been drizzling) - when I slipped and landed at the bottom in a heap - nobody noticed I'd even fallen. When I complained, they looked at me blankly. I then had to complain to reception because the only way I could turn the lamp off at the bedside was by turning the entire electricity off in the room by removing my card! The switch was broken. I asked to be moved and they told me they were full! My colleague had to leave the hotel at 10pm at night and at his own expense had to check into another hotel because his bed was covered in bedbugs when he arrived back from dinner! He complained to reception and the only excuse/apology he got was \"We are fully booked\".

We slept more on the mattress as on the sheets and on top of it all the linen had holes in it as well. 3 Breakfast What a disaster This hotel do not understand the meaning of continental breakfast. What you get is - A water downed artificial juice which tasted like nothing ever tasted before. - Over Boiled cold eggs as blue as it can be. - Cerials with no taste at all. - Cheese (one variate) slivers so thin that in the event of lifting them they tare apart. - Meat slivers from the lowest grade and standard possible. - Only sliced bread which you had to toast yourself no other option of buns or muffins, fresh fruit or even yogurt available. - One platter of the same cheese and meat every day - Dining room without table cloths and packed with to many tables and chairs for you to move around when 50 % occupied. In conclusion The world rate South Africa as a 3rd world BUT I can assure you that our one star Hotels are better than this three star dump (hotel)", "Date": "October 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cClean room, decent price\u201d", "Author": "leefacanada", "ReviewID": "UR41717409", "Content": "This was a great place to spend our night in transit back to Canada.", "Date": "September 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cGood enough for my 24-hour layover\u201d", "Author": "ALBinWDC", "ReviewID": "UR35102073", "Content": "I had a short layover in London on my way home to the US. It was decent enough for my needs -- clean, well kept, and most importantly for me, it was just around the corner from Paddington station where I had direct access to Heathrow via the Heathrow Express. The major drawback, though tolerable for my circumstance, was the lack of elevator. My room was small but since I was alone, I could deal with it. Had there been 2 of us, no way!! I concur with other reviewers about the breakfast. Also, there was no air conditioning. For me, not a big deal as I prefer fresh air. Would I stay there again? Possibly. I think if the hotel offered an in-room mini fridge to where I could store beverages and restaurant leftovers for later snacking, I would be more inclined.", "Date": "July 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vejle, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cWon't come back\u201d", "Author": "Mopa1009", "ReviewID": "UR21497547", "Content": "I booked The Beverley City hotel as a last minute act of panic.

It is easy to find from Paddington station (walking distance) so is very easy to get to from Heathrow airport. It is one little hotel in several similar hotels all in a row, set back from the street. There is no lift so pack light! The hallways, stairwells and rooms are very small and 'English' and I loved that. We stayed in a room for two and you wouldn't have fit three people in the room but it was cosy! The rooms are clean and tidy and the bathroom is tiny but functional. It's not for the fussy travellers because of its size, but we are not very fussy and we loved it! would definately stay there again.

We made the mistake of booking 5 nights here and it was so bad that we left after the first night. In no particular order, the bad points are: 1. There is no lift or elevator so if you have large suitcases and are staying on the higher floors, you will either have to lug them up to your room yourself or pay some poor cleaner 5 pounds to help you. The guy at reception will not help in any way. 2. The rooms are TINY - one person and one suitcase cannot fit in a twin room at the same time. Also, two single beds will only fit in a twin room if they are pushed together, so don't expect any personal space at night... 3. Supposedly 'non-smoking' room smelt terribly of stale cigarettes. 4. Guy at reception goes home at 6pm so if you need assistance after that time, you are out of luck! 5. There is no ventilation so the rooms are very stuffy. 6. There is no 'full English Breakfast' - what you get is reconstituted orange juice, thin pieces of toast and fake jam-type substance to put on it. This place is like many others near Paddington Station - an overpriced dump masquerading as a hotel.
