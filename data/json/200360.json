Got into Berlin Tegel early from Amsterdam after KLM flight from JFK. I had the day before called ahead to set up our rooms (2 twin rooms) for early arrival with the manager. After our adventurous cab ride from the airport, we got to the hotel @ 11AM, and sure enough, the girl at the front desk had the rooms ready and waiting, check in was a breeze. I was there with 3 of my buddies, we dropped off our bags, and headed out to see the sights, it was our one and only day in Berlin, unfortunately. The hotel was very clean, I don't think it had free internet, but to us that was no big deal. Rooms were about average size, bed wasn't the biggest for a twin, but I've slept on worse. Bathroom and shower was decent. The hotel was a 5 minute walk from a U-bahn stop, I forget which one, but it's very convenient. From there you can get to all over Berlin and the myriad of sights to see, we saw as much as we could in 1 day, I think. After we were done sightseeing, there was a little bar/restaurant right outside of the main entrance where we had our dinner, the waiter spoke excellent English (despite his claims only speaking \"a little\" - why do all Germans say that when they usually are very proficient?!) and was hilarious...and on top of that, the food and beer was delicious. All around a great, fun dinner experience for our rapidly tiring selves. After that went back to our rooms, turned on the TV and watched some German programs before zonking out. The room and area was very quiet, esp for a Friday night, no rowdy drunks or parties or anything. Woke up in the middle of the night, but that was due to time zone screwup, not the bed, which was quite comfortable. There was no free breakfast the next morning, but there was one of the delicious, ubiquitous pastry shops around the corner, and we stocked up before catching our train to Frankfurt.
