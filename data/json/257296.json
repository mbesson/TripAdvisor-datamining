We had an average stay. The best thing about the hotel was its location, right in the middle of downtown with lots of restaurants and shopping. It is also very close to all the major tourist locations in Sydney, such as the Opera House, Sydney Harbour Bridge, Botannical Gardens, Circular Quay, Darling Harbour, etc. All this is well within walking distance. The room and bathroom was quite new and elegant but a bit on the small side. Felt a bit cramped inside especially after having stayed at the Marriott with their enormous rooms. Didn't like the fact that there was no free Wifi in the rooms. Also, when I asked to borrow an adapter for one day, they wanted me to buy one for AUD$15. Surely there is no need for this. The Marriott gave me one free. The pool and jacuzzi on the roof are extremely small. At most only two people can swim at any one time. The view of the city from the rooftop is nice. This is a perfectly adequate place to stay and the art deco style of the building is nice.

I emailed the contact address from the website with a request for a room on the upper floors facing inwards as I'm a light sleeper. The Hotel emailed back and said they would do what they can. On arrival, I was greeted with a velvet rope barrier and had to wait there while the young chap tapped on his computer for a few moments. Once I was served it was all pretty standard, though I did have trouble understanding his European accent. I got the impression he was pretty proud of it, and didn't want to make too much effort to help people understand him. I was placed on the eleventh floor with a window looking in. I could not hear any street noise at all. The room itself was a King Deluxe, and as others have reviewed, it's a very pleasant experience. I found the room was thoughtfully laid out, particularly the work space for business travellers who need a desk, phone and work lamp. I don't even bother with in-room internet any more as it's just so outrageously expensive in Australian hotels, so I can't comment on that. I did notice a wireless network available. There's an Irish-themed pub downstairs with the usual authentic Irish refuse all over the walls, though it did have a pretty good atmosphere for a quick beer before dinner. For dinner I thought I'd try the in-house restaurant, but was met by a surly 'barrista' who was too busy for customers. I then tried the doorman, who was very helpful and sent me to an Italian restaurant around the corner. He was very courteous and helpful and knew his job. More hotels should have these types of older gents who know the area and know the clientele. As mentioned the room was very quiet until 4.30am when a very inconsiderate person slammed a door. That was it, and I just lay there for the next couple of hours. Breakfast was pretty good. I was seated quickly and the coffee came shortly after that. The selection was as good as you'd expect, and I had no complaints about the service or the food, only the very noisy people at the table next to me. Why do people think everyone wants to hear their conversation? Check out was prompt and uneventful. I'll probably return.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGood location, facilities variable\u201d", "Author": "maxie88", "ReviewID": "UR127858787", "Content": "I stayed at the Grace for one night, on business.

Other locations within the CBD area, e.g. Sydney Tower and various shopping malls, are within a few minutes easy stroll, and Circular Quay is not too far away. If one enjoys Irish Pubs, P.J.

We were travelling with another couple, on a tour of Australia, and because we flew from Cairns to Sydney, we didn't arrive at the hotel until quite late in the afternoon. On our arrival we were told that we had been allocated rooms 909 and 536. Now, it was obvious that we were couples travelling together because our bookings were made under one reference. So why had we been given rooms 4 floors apart? We had made a request via our travel agent for \"hight floors and kingsized beds\". When we questioned why weren't allocated rooms together, both on high floors, we were told, quite bluntly that these were the only rooms left as the hotel was \"very busy\". Our friends had room 909, which they were happy with and which overlooked the street. However, room 536 faced onto the inner square of the hotel and looked directly into brick walls and the windows of other rooms. There was no natural light to speak of and the room was dark and claustrophobic. We went back to the reception immediately and complained. We were told that we could change rooms the next day and that if we left our luggage packed, the staff would move it for us. This was done and we moved to room 835, which was a very good room, with nice big windows, overlooking York Street. Had this been our room in the first instance, we would not have had cause to complain. The both our rooms were large and very comfortable. We had a walk in shower in our room, whilst room 909 had a bath with a shower attachment. We were all happy with the cleanliness and overall condition of both rooms. The breakfast at the Grace was excellent. There were lots of choices in both the continental and the cooked breakfast. There is a chef for \"cooked to order\" eggs and omelets and their honey yoghurt was to die for! The Grace Hotel itself is beautiful throughout and the only negative I would say is that it is a rather impersonal hotel. The staff are polite, but with the exception of the consierge team, not very friendly. The location of the hotel is very good, within 10 minutes walk of Darling Harbour, and probably only 15 or 20 minutes walk to Sydney Harbour.

The location of the room in the heart of the city does mean that there is a lot of street noise at night, so I did get woken up early with traffic noise. The other key drawback of the room was that the aircon was very loud, so you could not have it on when you are sleeping, making the room a bit stuffy. I used the hotel pool, which again was spotless, but you could not have more than two people in the pool doing laps. Hotel gym was small, but had bike, XT, rower, runner and some dumbells.

We booked it through Wotif and it turned out to be a good choice in Sydney, in terms of its location and price. We arrived from Sydney Airport thoroughly jetlagged, and despite being early the room was ready for us, which was good. It was a \"superior\" room (their lowest grade) and was generally fine, though we were slightly puzzled by the inclusion of a baby cot in the room (we don't have children and didn't request this), though it was removed the next day by the equally bemused hotel staff! The hotel is in a central location, a few minutes walk to the tube and walkable to the Rock's, Circular Quay, Darling Harbour (the closest to hotel) etc. The concierge provided some maps etc to help with our travels, and was also able to book a shuttle bus back to the airport at the end of our stay. It's worth doing this to get from SYD airport to the hotel incidentally - it cost less than half the price of a taxi for two of us to go by shuttle service. Our room was comfortable and (with the cot removed) spacious enough, though not enormous. The bed was extremely comfortable, and the room also had a good easy chair, workstation, tv, tea/coffee etc. The bathroom was smallish but functional, though I'd have preferred a full shower curtain to the half-length screen, but that's just personal preference. See photos for a better idea of room layout etc. We slept well all four nights (including weekend nights) and weren't troubled by any noise, though we had requested and got a high floor room which may have contributed to that. We visited the pool area one evening, on the roof. There's a lap pool and a jacuzzi, both of which were fine for one group but could be a bit crowded if there was more than two of you (or more than one group) there at a time. Not bad for a couple of minutes relaxing though. In summary this is a good choice of hotel if you need a base in Sydney (where even regular hotel rooms can cost the earth), with comfortable rooms, helpful staff, and a good central location close to tourist attractions and the CBD.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cAlways a favourite..\u201d", "Author": "Etoile76", "ReviewID": "UR124795511", "Content": "I have stayed at this property a number of times over the past few years and it never disappoints.

Very pleasant at desk - only thing is they didn't tell me how I would use the WiFi/ internet (did I need a log in?). As some mentioned, it is $25 bucks a day for WiFi - ouch. Concierge/ doormen/ bellhop were two guys working all aspects - super friendly. Up to room 739: pretty basic, but very clean. (see pics) King bed looks nice - mounted reading lights on each side. HUGE wardrobe with dresser inside. Usual ironing board & iron and a clothes brush (nice). Wardrobe lights up when you open it - nice touch. extra pillow and blanket in the wardrobe. Safe is a bit small - barely fit my mac book pro. Electric kettle & tea in room and mini bar where you fill out the form to take with you at check out. appears to be soda, beer, a few sweets. Outlet at desk for computer - you have to turn on the outlet. This hotel is an eco/ green hotel - you MUST put your key card in a slot by the door to turn on any lights/ air conditioning, etc. good desk light as well. Ok flat screen (I'm guessing 30\"?) The hotel has all their info, guest messages, etc via the TV as well via a messaging system. I was worried b/c on the hotel info on the TV it seemed that there were only 5 TV channels - but there are more when you just surf through them. (I know nobody goes to Sydney for TV, but when jet lag hits!) Small sitting chair/ side TV and lamp - two big windows. not a great view though - some high rises on this side. Two large side tables with leather look on each side of the bed. lots of room. Alarm clock. Full length mirror. Bathroom: haven't tried yet but clean and spartan. Ok amount of room for supplies - but I have a lot of things. One of those attached hair dryers. HUGE shower, no tube in this room. Probably fit 4 people in the shower. No additional lock on the door - which I'm used to with American hotels. Just the one latch. I will try out the business center, pool and sauna later. Food: There is apparently 24/7 room service which I will try out & report on. As well as the Grace Brasserie and Cafe. I did go to the P. J. O Brien's right around the corner. Typical pub place - go up to the bar and order & pay and you get a number for your table. So Americans, don't expect to be seated:) Fish & chips were good, but nothing amazing. Service friendly. What's around? There is a HUGE row of shops one block down on George Street. Boutiques, Apple Store, Tourist places-- you name it. There is a pharmacy/ drug store almost right across York St. from the hotel - perfect for anything you forgot. Besides toiletries they have some candy, snacks, soda, water. There are a few corner shop/ bodegas around the corner as well. Getting around: There is apparently 1 block away on George St. in front of the Apple Store the \"Free 555 Green Bus\" - that goes in a loop for free to the Circular Quay.

The breakfasat on the second floor was an average buffet and one section of the restaurant was tacky and looked as if a range of conference tables had been added to extend seating capacity.

I was very disappointed to have to pay $25 a night for the privilege of Internet which is standard in most 4-5 star hotels all around the world for free, even mc donalds around the corner had it as a free service. Anyway, I tried to set it up but I couldn't get a signal. I rang front desk and they sent their tech guy up, he couldn't get it working, said he would be back and I never saw him again. After waiting over an hour I told them what happened and they sent 2 guys up this time, both struggling with English so it was hard to make myself understood. They tried at one point to connect with the phone line but gave that up after I said iPads aren't wired that way. I knew at that point I was in trouble. They proceeded to walk off in defeat but didn't come back either. So, no wifi as I gave up, at least I saved myself $100. My next gripe was something I had read about while reading the reviews of the hotel, this was the sound levels from the street below. 2 Biggs in. Row I was woken up by sirens and car noise as well as the noise coming from the pub across the road. It is hard to believe they didn't design it with double glazing. On the positive side, it is quite central and the doorman was superb addressing me by name and always pleasant. As I travel alot OS I still find this hotel lacking in many areas especially for the price compared to others I frequent. I would like to say that after leaving my charger there, I rang them and asked if they could post it back to me, they told me the postal rates and I said that considering the poor effort with the Internet maybe they could consider wavering the few dollars postage and send it up to me in the name of good service. They did indeed!

The Grace's location is so central with everything within walking distance. The building is a classic, maintaining its history through the decor and lighting, giving it a nice welcoming feeling. Unfortunately, the same couldn't be said for the doorman whom we only spotted once during our stay. Upon arrival, we were given our room promptly, however, the concierge did not take our bags to our room despite having an 8 week old baby in our arms. My husband was left to take our two suitcases, backpack and baby bag while unoccupied staff members did not offer to help. Our room was comfortable and clean with a very nice bed. The shower was brilliant with a great flow of hot water. If you're after a view, then this is not the hotel to go to. We had an internal facing window which offered very little. We ordered room service a few times. Food was prompt, plentiful and tasty. However, it's probably best to wander down to the cafe on the ground floor to get a wider range of food at cheaper prices. They do offer takeaway! Room service staff were friendly and cleaned the basics well, though didn't replace the sheets in our baby's cot which was a little disappointing considering the mess babies make. The range of amenities was great. It was so helpful to have a guest laundry with the amount of washing a family has to do. Though $8 to use the machine per load is a little steep. The gym is reasonably equipped and the lap pool is a great idea though could be cleaned a little more often. WiFi is available, but at $11 per hour or $23 per day, I think most people would pass. It's disappointing that Internet access is treated as a luxury in hotels like this one. Our checkout experience was fantastic. The concierge of the day was very helpful in getting us a taxi with a baby seat and helped us all the way to the taxi. It was greatly appreciated. Overall, this hotel has the potential to be something outstanding. Unfortunately, it's let down by a number of niggles that could easily be rectified.", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cWonderful business travel accommodation\u201d", "Author": "goldie01", "ReviewID": "UR119454608", "Content": "I have stayed at the Grace approx. 20 times in the last 3 years, always for business.

Definitely not good enough for a 4 star hotel. Suggest eating elsewhere - for both value and quality. Fat Buddha (Chinese restaurant) and Yama (Japanese and good breakfasts) on level 2 QVB within easy walking distance and both excellent.

The building architecture is classic neo-gothic in style and looks great from the outside. We approached the front counter to check in to speak to a staff member who had very basic english skills. We shrugged this off as being part of multicultural Sydney and moved on. When we checked in at 12.30pm there were no porters available to assist with luggage or show us to the room. The card was placed on the table in front of us and we went from there. Letting ourselves into the room, we found it to be clean but extremely small and almost no natural light whatsoever. The shower in the room was only capable of producing luke warm water at its hottest. I brought this issue up several times and it was never investigated. I found this to be one of the worst aspects of this hotel. On the second night we called down to room service for an ice bucket only to be told that it would be \"at least 30mins because they are busy\". When this was questioned, I was advised to \"get the ice myself from level 5\". I then proceeded down to level 5, eventually located the ice machine in a closed off room, but realised there were no ice buckets there. I approached the restaurant on the first floor to request an ice bucket. I explained the reason I was there was because room service had advised me they were too busy. The staff member at the front of the restaurant told me to approach the bar and go through the same explanation again. I went to the bar and requested the ice bucket, eventually getting it and filling it on level 5. I was starting to wish I hadn't chosen champagne for the evening! On the last morning of our stay we were awoken early twice to loud knocking (despite having the privacy please sign hung on the door). They became aggressive at 10am (apparently their checkout time, never come across such an early checkout time in my life). I called down to reception and spoke to the \"duty manager\" who advised me that I would have to pay $15/hr for each hour after the 10am checkout time. I tried reasoning with the duty manager, but it was ultimately a waste of time. I complained to the front of house manager when I was checking out, his face expressionless and kept asking him what I wanted him to do about it. I guess he gets that feedback pretty often.

This led to an absolute debacle on checking out with staff scratching their heads whilst the queue got longer and longer. Eventually someone got the message and found the email with the order number and off we went. A week later I got an account in the mail where they had charged my credit card for accommodation and parking. A day later I got a credit note for the accommodation but not the parking. I called the hotel and they were going to check with the company. A month later I am still waiting. The hotel has an Irish Bar which is certainly Irish. For my first beer I ordered a middy (10oz) of light beer. I was told I could only have a schooner (15oz) or a pint (20oz) so I ordered a schooner. For my next drink I asked for a schooner of another brand and was told I could only have a half pint (10oz) or a pint. Duh! Overall I rate this hotel as a desireable place to stay in Sydney. It is in a very convenient location, but the staff really need to get their act together and the pretentious nonsense in the bar is dumb.", "Date": "August 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canberra, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Very Bad Service\u201d", "Author": "watermelon_23", "ReviewID": "UR76433819", "Content": "I booked this hotel as a mystery deal through the Need It Now website.

We went back down to reception to try and get a different room with twin beds only to be told that my booking for twin beds through Need it Now was \"just a request\" and they couldn't guarantee that I would be able to have a room with that configuration.

We were then told that they *might* be able to put an extra bed in the room but that it would cost an extra $55. We then went back up to the room and upon closer inspection discovered that the king size bed was actually two twin beds that had been pushed together. Off we went back down to reception and requested that the beds be separated and made up into two twin beds. While we were out at lunch the receptionist left a message letting me know that housekeeping considers the bed a king and that they have put another bed in the room at the addtional cost of $55. After attempting to get this issue sorted out with the receptionist three times, in the end I just gave up!! This hotel has been beautifully refurbished and the location is extremely handy if you are looking for an inner city hotel, but unfortunately those benefits do not outweigh the poor customer service I received from the staff on hotel reception (IMHO). In addition to the $55 I was charged for the extra bed, we were also charged extra just for using a credit card.

It is convenient that there is a cafe in the lobby, a bar upstairs for a quick drink and more of a pub just off the lobby. So if you're weary after a day of sightseeing, there are plenty of good options without venturing out. But there are also plenty of great restaurants within a few minutes of the hotel. We left The Grace to tour other parts of the country, but returned for one additional night on our way home so that we'd be in Sydney the day before our departure.

Check-In was quick and friendly - and early - at 1:00 in the afternoon. Both rooms that we had were clean and in pristine condition and the beds were amazing. It was a shame to not spend more time in them! The bathrooms were great and the showers worked well - although it was a bit of a step to get over the side of the bathtub. The staff were very helpful and the concierge held some of our luggage for a week while we were enjoying the Outback. Only to have it swiftly returned to our new room on arrival. Initially, I was slightly concerned about being too far from Circular Quay, but it turned out to be a non-issue. It was easily walking distance to the Quay, the Rocks district, the Opera House, etc. The location of the hotel is actually quite good because of its close proximity to Darling Harbour, which has at least as many good things to offer (Wild Australia, the Aquarium, the Maritime Museum, IMAX, and even a casino...). Our only concern about the Grace was the expense. We did not use the internet, but we did have one dinner in the restaurant - for 72 dollars. The food was good, but there are many other options in the area. Also, we opted to take advantage of the guest laundry machines before leaving for our Outback excursion. 8 dollars per wash, 8 dollars per dry and 2 dollars for detergent made our one load of laundry worth 18 dollars. Convenient, yes - reasonable, no. Make no mistake, the Grace is a beautiful hotel. It is well situated, the service is excellent and the beds are fantastic.

Only real complaint was the king bed -- the mattress was at the end of it's life. The two sides were people usually sleep had significant sag and can be uncomfortable. The centre of the bed was still fresh and much more pleasant to sleep on, as long as you don't roll to the side and fall into the sagging spots again.

I actually found the 4* Holiday Inn just as comfortable, except at half the price. So you'll need to ask yourself how much you wanna pay for the location and nice decor.

I spent a very pleasant two days here in August 2009. Friendly staff and pleasing art deco style. The hotel was built in the early 1930s as a flagship department store, later acquired by the government as used as a headquarters by Douglas MacArthur's during. WWII. Thoroughly remodeled in the 1990s and converted to a hotel. Pros: Location--Central Business District, about 15-20 minute walk to Circular Quay (harbor area). Numerous stores and sights within walking distance. Room--Clean, well appointed and equipped. Flat screen TV, but no refrigerator. Quiet--No discernible street noise from my 4th floor room. Quirks and Cons: To use the bathroom and entry light you need to insert your room card into a slot near the door--an energy saving 'feature' It took a call to the front desk to figure out what was wrong with the lights. Skip the Brasserie on the second floor--the one meal I had there (breakfast buffet) was mediocre at best, Perhaps the entre meals are better. In contrast, the breakfast I enjoyed at the ground floor Cafe was very good. The Irish Bar on the ground floor looked fun, but was very loud and crowded--as should be expected on a weekend night. The Business Center charges $11 per hour for internet service on their two computers. I don't know if they have WiFi, or how much it costs. I didn't use the parking garage, so can't comment on it. One standout restaraunt for me was the \"Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe\" (http://www.redoak.com.au/) which was a block away out the back door of the hotel.", "Date": "August 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "hampshire", "Title": "\u201cterrific\u201d", "Author": "sandburn", "ReviewID": "UR38829467", "Content": "what a fantastic hotel very central for all the sights and the shops. hotel reception staff were friendly and welcoming rooms spacious and clean will definately stay there again next time I visit Sydney", "Date": "August 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland OR USA", "Title": "\u201cGreat 4 star value in central city\u201d", "Author": "Tferrari", "ReviewID": "UR34320927", "Content": "This is a great hotel unless you are looking for 5 star luxury.

On a recent stay at the Jamison where the staff welcome and greet you at the door, take luggage to your room and have ample parking available under the hotel this place was closer to 3 star than 5. There was no welcome, no sight of a concierge and as the parking station was full we were told to park 2 blocks away in a public parking station where we had to pay daily rates and where we could not take our car out unless we wanted to pay an hourly rate of $10-20. When we arrived in our room we were very happy with the spaciousness and the comfortable bed but the furnishings were rundown, had obvious scratch and scuff marks on them and we had a lovely view of the club next door. Breakfast was good, nice service here from staff and the buffet had a lot of variety. Unfortunately the problem was with the staff. Whilst in the a bar within the building I badly injured my foot and needed bandaids. When my husband requested these from reception he was refused then questioned about his occupancy at the hotel. Only when he fought to prove he was staying did the receptionist offer to call to get some (and asked him to wait 10mins). When both myself and my husband were returning for the bandaids the receptionist was closing the doors to enter reception 5 feet in front of us. He turned, shut, then locked the doors and rudely ushered us out onto the street to walk around the block to the front door!! (My feet bleeding and no shoes on) When we got to reception the new receptionist knew nothing about bandaids but got them for us straight away. When this was mentioned to the manager in the morning he was very apologetic and said he would investigate and call us in the next two days. We recieved a call from him SEVEN days later stating that the 'receptionist did not recall the incident but he was sorry anyway'. Working in this industry for 5 years that is the first time I have ever heard a manager of a 5 star hotel tell an unhappy customer that his staff don't remember the incident but he is sorry if it happened. He might as well have told us that as far as he was concerned we made it all up. Not exactly what I expected.

We are generally easy going guests and didn't tax the hotel staff at all. Check in and check out were quick and efficient.

On returning to the hotel about 4pm the room was ready but we had to chase up our bags and I ended up literally getting them myself from the luggage storage area (to be fair it seemed maybe 2 tour groups had arrived as there was luggage all over the lobby so the porters were pretty busy). Our room was on the 9th floor so was almost shielded from the noises of the city but not completely. However I figure some noise is the price you pay for a central city hotel. Still I didn't appreciate the police sirens at 4am or the helicopter hovering outside both mornings (delivering equipment to the rooftop of a nearby building). The room itself was an Ok size, no comfortable seating which annoys me and an old TV, with only a few channels to choose from. Shower over bath is also annoying, especially in what is essentially a reasonably modern hotel. Amenities were basic, standard horrible hotel coffee and UHT milk. No robes but otherwise everything else seemed fine. Housekeeping wasn't totally sharp, they only washed out one of our coffee mugs and neither of our used water glasses, there were significant smudges on the windows but otherwise the room was very clean.

Due to the fact that this is an old building - the elevators seem to be a problem - you have to wait a long time between them - and when they arrive they are often packed. Staff - a bit quiet and a little grumpy, although effiecient enough. I've been spoiled by other places I think. My package had the breakfast included in the restuarant on the 2nd floor. Was pretty standard - with a good western and eastern selection. Nothing too fancy. Weirdly the Bacon was of the streaky American type rather than the standard Aussie/English type - this may reflect the nationality of much of the clientel (which appears to be elderly American package tourists). There is a cab rank right outside the hotel - and the drivers seem very very disappointed and grumpy if you aren't going to the airport.

It was real easy to connect through the wired cable the hotel provided. They listed some common problems and solutions to those problems as well on a little pamphlet. The internet was reasonably fast. It definitely satisfied my desire. The second item of note was the gym closed at 9:30PM. My days are long, and I usually required late night access to a gym. The view from my room on the fifth floor was limited, but expected for the price and location. The location placed me within walking distance to so many markets, areas to eat, and attractions. The only taxis I had to use were work related activities. The area around the hotel has a quieter night life compared to other areas of Sydney, but I wanted that, so I was quite pleased. The area around the hotel provided food up until midnight which was the latest I tired to eat something. Inside the hotel, there were two stores, a restaurant, and a bar. You could stay inside the hotel and have a full experience. The iron included in my room was a hot plate type iron. The hotel also uses your hotel key as the source of power, so you need to keep the key in a slot need the entry door to maintain power throughout the room.

It has the \"grand old\" look of a classic National Trust building, but the rooms are quite basic. We spent two nights in the Grace just after New Year's 2008, and found it to be an acceptable, if unremarkable, lodging. Read on for details... LOCATION: The Grace is on York street, roughly equidistant between the Wynyard and Town Hall train stations. It's not immediately adjacent to anything with tourist interest, but it's an easy walk to most major locations including the Botanic Gardens, Aquarium, Sydney Tower, and some of the historic sites and museums. The hotel is perched on a street with several restaurants, pubs and clubs, so especially on weekend evenings, the surrounds can be a bit raucous. Request a room on a high floor or away from York if you're an early-to-bed sort. Additionally, the \"vision-impaired\" beeping crosswalk signals are located just below the York street-facing guest rooms, so a quiet but noticeable beep-beep-beep is a continual presence. Another reason to request a high floor. ROOMS: The rooms are basic but adequate. A small TV, bedside clock/alarm, overhead reading lights and the usual hotel furniture are all present. The bathroom is acceptable, except we had issues with hot water and pressure in the shower. The water pressure would \"pulse\" in the shower, and with each pulse, the water temp would swing a good 10-degrees. So showers were often an exercise in freezing and broiling, alternately. This evened out after the first day, so the problem would seem to be intermittent. The room had wired Internet (at a cost) available, an in-room safe, and plenty of closet space. SERVICE: We had no issues with the hotel staff. We arrived quite early in the day, and were immediately given a room well before normal check-in times. The staff answered our questions and were pleasant, even though they were not quite as helpful (especially the concierge) regarding arrangements outside the hotel as one would expect from a higher-end hotel. They did seem to make a solid effort though -- at one point when we had to leave a message at the front desk for another guest, they left a voice notification on their phone, slid a printed message under their door, and left an on-TV message for them! So, they're at least as thorough as they're able to be, for any given request. AMENITIES: The hotel itself is fairly basic, but the street-level amenities are pretty good. There is a trendy bar/tapas restaurant, a full-service cafe, a buffet Brasserie and an Irish pub in the building. Not world-shaking cuisine by any means, but perfectly adequate for a downtown meal, without paying the higher prices of the more touristy districts. Overall, the Grace is showing a bit of its age. The windows are slightly drafty. The fixtures have been polished a few times too many... But I believe the official description for somewhere like the Grace is that \"it has charm\". If you're into staying in the classic hotels, The Grace stacks up well to its generational counterparts around the world. All-in-all, if you're able to secure a good rate, there is no reason NOT to stay at The Grace. For most travelers who don't intend to spend too much time in their rooms, this hotel will serve adequately. But if you're going for a special occasion or a romantic weekend getaway, and don't mind paying a bit more, you're likely to find slightly fresher options within a short distance of this location.", "Date": "February 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cThe Dis-Grace Hotel\u201d", "Author": "explore_&_indulge", "ReviewID": "UR12832735", "Content": "I occasionally travel to Sydney for work or holiday and had the misfortune of the Grace Hotel being on my employers approved hotel list.

The concierge and porter were very polite and welcoming and relieved me of my bags immediately. However, the member of reception with whom I had the misfortune to deal, was extremely SURLY and RUDE. I was understanding of the fact that, as I had checked in early, my room might not be ready. (However, on reading this website, I see that some people have been far more fortunate than I was and have been allotted their respective rooms on early check-in.) While I was waiting for my room, I went into the Caf\u00c3\u00a9 off the lobby for breakfast. The staff in there were very friendly and, on hearing that I had just arrived in Sydney for the first time, proceeded to give me advice on where to go and what to see in the immediate area. The breakfast was also excellent! Afterwards, I went back to sit patiently in the lobby, where I remained until after 10.00a.m. I then noticed a busload of people checking in and immediately going to their rooms. On observing this, I approached the reception desk to politely inquire why a room was not ready for me at this stage, as I had remarked on booking that I would be arriving early. The same member of reception I had encountered on check-in spoke to me, once again, in a rude and insulting manner. I then informed him that, in all my travels, I had never encountered such bad manners in any hotel staff. I requested to speak to the manager and, quietly but firmly, made him aware of my disgust at the treatment I had received from his colleague. He took this on board and assured me that he would deal with the problem. I stayed in the Grace Hotel for four nights in November and returned for two nights on December 9th and 10th. I was very satisfied with my accommodation on the first occasion and loved the upgrade I received when I came back. My room was on the eighth floor and was spacious and bright. I loved many things about this hotel - the beds (only in the Omni Parker House Hotel in Boston have I experienced beds as comfortable as those!), the art deco surroundings, the lifts!, the location (brilliant for shopping and sight seeing). As it was my first time visiting Australia, I think it was rather unfortunate that I had to meet up with the rudest person I ever met in a hotel reception, on my first morning in the country. All my other experiences in Sydney and Australia were brilliant! From other postings here, I notice that I am not the only person who has experienced rudeness from a member of reception at this hotel.

After much research, we chose The Grace for the first week of our stay. We needed to book a further 4 nights in Sydney following a week of travelling around NSW but waited until we had arrived in Sydney so we could look around the city and see if there was a better situated hotel. It was immediately clear that the location of the Grace was perfect - 5 minutes from Darling Harbour, 10 minutes from Hyde Park and 10-15 minutes from Circular Quay. We did check on a hotel near Circular Quay for our return stay but they quoted AUD435 per night, compared to AUD250 at The Grace! We had arrived from Hong Kong at 0810 and had gotten no sleep on the flight so were pretty tired. Our room was available for us when we arrived at the hotel at 10am, for which we were very thankful. So many previous reviews mentioned the comfortable beds so we were looking forward to testing it out, since I suffer from back pain. We had a look around Darling Harbour and got back to our room at around 5.30pm. By 6.30 we were asleep and woke up at 8.30 the next morning! How's that for a comfortable mattress! We slept through all our jetlag and were completely acclimatised when we woke up. The room was very nicely decorated, contemporary furnishings and was cleaned to a very high standard. An added bonus was the laundry room for guests use. As we were away for 5 weeks and were trying to travel light, we found it very useful to be able to wash our clothes without the expense of having to use the hotel's offsite laundry. When we checked out of our first stay, we reconfirmed our return and asked for a room on a higher floor than before. We were very pleased on our return to be given a room on the 10th floor, with great highrise views - we could see the Sydney Tower from our window! The only thing that was disappointing was the lack of a hotel bar - the new Bar 77 only opened the night before we left. There was an Irish bar which could be accessed from within the hotel's reception area but on the Saturday night, when we came back for the night and would have liked a nightcap, we found that the internal door was locked. The Assistant Manager came up to help us and said we would have to go out into the street and stand in the queue to get into the bar! The cafe was good for snacks but that, too, was for public use.

The heritage of the building is beautiful especially when you walk into the grand lobby through the original Grace department store doors. The floor tiling is spectacular and it's like stepping back in time. Adjacent to the lobby near the elevators, is a history of the building which is rather fascinating to read. We stayed on the 10th floor which is the heritage floor. Our window looked directly up at the Centrepoint Tower, which illuminated at night is wonderful. The decor is modern dark timber which is a favourite look of mine, yet the decor didn't detract from the building heritage. The floor above has the pool and gym. The pool is really a lap pool, we didn't swim there at all. Take a ferry out to Manly or a bus to Bondi and enjoy the beach culture whilst in Sydney. The hotel is located so central to the city shopping and eating. Eating is a short 5 minute walk to either King Street Wharf, Darling Harbour and Cockle Bay Wharf. We walked numerous times down to Circular Quay, however it is a good 15min walk but fairly easy. Sydney is rather pricey to eat, however I can recommended Velvet Slide at King Street Wharf and Blackbird at Cockle Bay for reasonable price eating. Ghengis Khan is great too. Some restaurants have specials on different nights. A full breakfast buffet was included in our room rate, however it was nothing spectacular and I can only say don't pay for it, it's not worth it. The hotel being run by a Malaysian consortium, I expected better, since staying in Malaysian resorts. There are plenty of great eating places out of the hotel that are a lot cheaper than paying for the buffet.

However, since I was promised a room upgrade due to having booked more than 3 nights, I wasn't too perturbed. On arrival I was put off by being asked if it was \"just you\" booking in. Well, yes, since I was the only one standing there and the booking was in my sole name, that was the case. Single women do travel alone - revelation! I was proudly told by this silly woman that I was being upgraded to the Heritage floor. I then asked her what that meant, she replied she did not know, she then smirked and said \"extra things in the room....\" I was baffled by this and on arriving in my 11th floor room I was as baffled as previous reviewers as to what the difference could be, since this room looked like your average 4 star hotel room. The dark furniture depressed me until I got used to it, the view is over rooftops. The air con is great. The bathroom is average, only a bath, I found it uncomfortable showering as the bath is quite narrow and it is quite a hike into the high bath, don't stay here if you are even slightly disabled and you want to take a shower, though the hotel does acknowledge this as there is a sign on the bath offering aids if one cannot get in the bath. The room service meals were awful, I didnt think I could get a bad steak for $33 but you can at the Grace. I found a lot of local bistros, so don't eat in the hotel. The ice machine was broken on my floor which was a real hassle in very hot Sydney weather. I was there a week and no attempt was made to fix it. There are only 2 cable TV stations, CNN and BBC, they should have more. You can hear the plumbing of the surrounding rooms, the hallways are very humid as the air con does not stretch to that. Each evening a lovely man dropped off a liquour chocolate and a 600 ml bottle of water, which was very nice and does not happen in any 5 star hotel I know!
