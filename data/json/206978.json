The Calle de Alcala is boring with very few restaurants or shops of interest and is too far from Chueca to be comfortably walkable. The staff were accommodating but officious. I stayed here one night and would not have stayed any longer, although I would stay here again if I needed to overnight in Madrid. Another option to consider is the NH Sanvy, which is in a brighter neighborhood and slightly closer to Chueca. It also has a Pans and Company downstairs and is close to a small grocer, so there are more options for food there if you are traveling by yourself.", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rome, Italy", "Title": "\u201cMay be it was NY but staff disinterested\u201d", "Author": "Marshmellow66", "ReviewID": "UR124010869", "Content": "Stayed for 4 nights over New Year.

Two metro lines within easy walking distance, and Retiro park just a couple of blocks away. When we asked at the front desk for them to call us a taxi to the airport they called for one and said it would be there in five minutes. Several taxi's stopped out front before ours. When the concierge came and told us ours was there the driver spoke fluent English. The luck of the draw? .. or perhaps they had called an individual who they knew spoke English.

We did not eat breakfast there, there are endless cafes nearby, but did eat in the bar one evening. The choice was very limited, more like sandwiches or pizza with one or two larger dishes. The food was not great and overpriced and given the number of restaurants, eating out is a better option.No noise for us perhaps because we were not looking onto the road.

Amenities used to be great, not anymore (nice robes, all kinds of soaps, etc.-- now, no kleenex, no lotion, no shoe shine cloth, no radio, no desk lamp). There is no free WiFi. Some rooms are nice, others so small there is no room to walk around the bed. If you get one that hasn't been renovated, ask to switch. The beds and pillows and the bedding are very nice, that's a plus, and the heating/air conditioning controls work reasonably well. Watch out for the cost of the buffet breakfast if it is not included-- it is much more limited than it used to be, and about double the price-- way too expensive if all you want is a coffee and roll.
