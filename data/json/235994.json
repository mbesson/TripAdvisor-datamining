There are some steps to climb, (2 1/2 flights) but they are not steep and they are wide. Might be a problem for unfit or older people with heavy luggage though. We found it good value (only 275 Euros for three nights in a double superior room). The shower was in a bath so no problems with flooding like others have mentioned. Rooms have high ceilings and antique furniture and our balcony backed onto a private garden. One advantage of being a little away from the centre of Florence is that it is quieter than central hotels (though I dont think anywhere is completely quiet in Florence, particularly in August.) High ceilings and air conditioning make it bearable even in very hot weather such as we had.", "Date": "Aug 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR641148753", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "morriselectrical"}, {"Content": "Pensione Annalena is a hidden gem to stay in Florence!

It's three minutes from the Pitti Palace and Boboli Gardens, five minutes from Ponte Vecchio, and is very close to two bus lines. The hotel was quiet and had a great breakfast (included), but the best part by far was the staff. All staff members we were in contact with were friendly, helpful, and spoke great English. They allowed us to store our bags behind the desk for free for a whole day after we had checked out, and also helped us navigate the bus system. The only drawback is that there is no lift, which could be a problem if you have a lot of bags (we had a lot of bags, but didn't find it to be hugely detrimental). Also, my wife would have liked carpeting in the room, but I thought it added to the appeal because the floor was clean and had a very nice pattern. We weren't interested in wireless (which is available in each room) or watching tv (mostly Italian shows and poor reception), just in cleanliness, location, and staff, all of which were fantastic. We felt the price was good for the service and room, considering Florence is a very expensive city to stay in.

Since I only took the bus once, my guess is that the best stop is the 3rd stop on via dei Serragli and then walk to via Romana and look for the numbers on the houses, to see if you turn left or right.

It has been turned into a lovely, peaceful, spacious hotel. They have a huge, inviting lounge and bar area in the main lobby. There are some stairs to climb but they are broad and easy. There are large, modern bathrooms with plenty of hot water in the big tub/shower combo. My husband and I stayed there for 3 nights in early October 2006. We had been in Rome before that and our room at Pensione Annalena was so quiet compared to Rome. It is located behind the Boboli Garden. Our huge French window opened onto a secluded garden/greenhouse area. All I we could hear were birds singing. It was wonderful! Our room was huge and the bed had a good mattress and one of the softest blankets I have ever felt. Clean, crisp sheets every day. Wonderful thick towels, too. The furnishings were very pretty. We were on the other side of the Arno River from all the museums but still within a short walk of the bridges. We walked everywhere easily from our hotel. The only taxi we took was to get back to the train station. The breakfast was large, with a good variety, and there was delicious coffee made any way you liked it. The staff was very friendly and helpful and always wanted to know how our day had been and what we had seen. The taxi they called for came in less than 2 minutes! We hated to leave!

We had our complimentary and quite good coffee and breakfast on the terrace there. The bathroom was excellent and altogether we enjoyed our stay. Walking distance to museums etc but far enough away from the city center to have a little peace and quiet. The Annalena is across from a beautiful -- really beautiful -- garden connected with a famous palace -- this was a few years ago, and I've forgotten the name of the palace! But it's in all the guide books. Ask for one of the terrace rooms upstairs. Maybe some small rooms downstairs are not so good. Ours was excellent, however, and the price was good for Florence.

Breakfast was OK....just the basics, but the conversation with other patrons was lively and fun.Our triple did have 3 beds and a lovely terrace which we found somewhat ridiculous: the only access was by stepping out the window, which was NOT at a low enough level to provide easy navigation. The lovely garden was not at all lovely, and could only be considered a garden by stretching your imagination.The front desk people were fabulous, however. We really liked them, and they seemed somewhat horrified by our concerns (our mother's safety in the bathroom, for one....) The hotel was fully booked, but they did offer the use of a family apartment which was basically a 2 bedroom apartment with a bathroom. We declined, as we were unwilling to pack up and move all our luggage down a treacherous internal staircase for one night, then back up and down the main staircase to the street (see below).ALSO, you need to know that the hotel reception desk (don't call it a lobby...) is 2 1/2 LONG flights of stairs from the street.
