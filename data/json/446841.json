Kitchen, Dining and Lounge, and a comfortable queen size bed. The bathroom was a shiny marble one, shower over the bath, and there was also a seperate toilet elsewhere in the apartment. There was no washing machine, something that we thought would be included. The kitchen was not well equipped, and so we didn't use the facilities much We were disappointed with the apartment overall, I think comparably to Australia it was a 2 star! After our first night there we warmed to the place, it was all we needed it to be, though it was the standard wasn't what we expected. The Pearl is close to some small supermarkets, about a large block away from the underground air-conditioned train service. A large shopping mall, the BurJuman, is also a block away.

Its far from a sleazy area however, the constant small gathering of foreign women at certain corners does suggest something. But its not all doom and gloom, Dubai is a beautiful place and the wonders of this City are only a taxi away. (20 odd minutes to Emirates mall) Back to the hotel, It doesn't consist of what you'd expect from Dubai. No plasma TV's screens in the rooms, No fancy toiletry or furniture. Very basic (microwave, fridge, Oven, two baths, bedroom and living area) but it does serve its purpose. However, when going out and seeing all these other superb hotels, some which are only 40 odd pounds extra per night, You do think ''Maybe next time Ill stay here''. Staff are basic yet helpful, food wasn't to my liking, Rooms are very basic. But its not too bad! Would I stay here again? No!
