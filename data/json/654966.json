Although the Maridel is chock full of vintage era furnishings our experience was that it was clean and comfortable, but quite possibly in a crime strewn area that may require more detail, security, and safe procedure for their guest's parking area. Most disappointing was the owner's, Nancy and Paul, lack of attention to the destruction of our 1994 Fleetwood Brougham while parked on their property where Paul had directed us to park. \"You can just leave it parked in front there since you are just staying the night\", Paul said the day we checked in. Little did we suspect that the area was so dangerous. Had we known we would have parked our car in the secured lot with the rest of the guest's vehicles. Things happen in life and business. I am a business man. I know. I also know when a little common courtesy and at least an acknowledgment of how a patron's misfortune while being served by a business can go a long way toward's good relations and a better rating then what I am giving this motel. There was no offer of compensation for the damages to our beautiful classic car. No offer to compensate us for being up until 4AM cleaning glass out of our car at a distant 24hour Walmart so we could tape up the gaping hole in the back of our car where the window was - rain was forcasted for the day! There was no acknowledgment of their responsibility in directing us to park our car at the front of the motel exposed to pedestrian traffic. There was not even a simple 'sorry' offered up by Nancie as we checked out or by Paul as he zoomed past us with his head down like he didn't see us. Really?? Is it the Mariel's fault our car was damaged? Yes, I believe so. They know their neighborhood. Yet they directed us to park it in an exposed area. We did not have damage insurance on our car and these repairs; our return trip to Worcester County courts on Dec 4th to try to collect from the culprit Nicholas M Maher; our stay at another motel for that trip and the fuel will be out of our pocket. Some sort of acknowledgement and compensation would have been appropriate. Too bad the management of the Maridel is so poor. The old motel itself is suffering for it.", "Date": "September 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mount Airy, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cClean, Well Priced, Great Service!\u201d", "Author": "Greg L", "ReviewID": "UR138019612", "Content": "When we arrived, we tried to check in an hour early and they were happy to give us our room early. The check in went smoothly and quickly. When we got to our rooms we noticed that the room was outdated, but clean. We checked the sheets for bugs and stains and found none. The air conditioner worked good, as well as the microwave and refridgerator. We did notice that behind the curtains is a bar to hang towels or bathing suits and it smelled a little over there, but nothing noticeable if not standing back there. The bathroom was small and the shower was a little dirty, but nothing too unbearable. I also want to note that they do not include any extras, just the bare necessties, as far as toiletries--they only provide the towels, plastic cup and a few bars of soap, but nothing more. Inside the room, we could not hear any loud talking or televisions. Good location for convention center and other restaurants. For the money, this motel is a great place to stay!

It was much cheaper than mostly all of the other hotels in Ocean City. The look of the building is very old and outdated. There are power lines and power transformers right behind the building, so when you are in the pool, that is the view you have. The pool was on the smaller side, but was clean. The cushions on the pool lounge chairs were very dirty, but we just removed them. Check in went smoothly and the front desk staff were friendly and helpful. The room left a lot to be desired. It was quite small and had a bit of an odor. The carpet was very dirty and after only a few minutes of walking around on it, my daughters feet were black on the bottom. I had to wear my flip flops the whole time in the room. I also found hair one one of the bath towels that was hanging up. With all of that being said, the motel is a 5 minute walk to the beach and was priced much less than pretty much every place else in the area. Would I stay there again? No, but if you are traveling on a budget and don't mind less than good, than it is for you. I will pay the extra $100 for better accommodations next time.", "Date": "July 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brentwood, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cClean, Low cost, and Close to Convention Ctr\u201d", "Author": "threeMainCoons", "ReviewID": "UR115219438", "Content": "This small motel is clean and very very close to the convention center.

I would recommend this motel if you want to save money and want a clean, quiet place to stay. This was a business trip so I can't comment on access to the beach but I saw others who were coming and going daily to the beach by car.
