They don't have an in-house restaurant but there's a 7-11 in the MTR station so you can grab some midnight snacks, chips and some cup noodles, there's also a McDonalds nearby for your breakfast fix. Housekeeping was great, room was always spotless and in order every time we come home, which is just perfect since it was such a small room, one shoe or suitcase not pressed against the wall and it can easily get crowded.

However for Hong Kong standards the price is relatively cheap, but again no ample space. Fit for Asian guests ONLY. Free WIFI in the room also compared to other hotels in Hong Kong in which you have to pay 100HKD for a day's use.

Not many rooms in Hong Kong have this Very clean and modern and very comfortable. The shower is small but very powerful and hot We would love to take the mattress and pillows home with us. We slept very well as it was very quiet About 5 mins walk to Prince Edward Station and 10 mins to the local markets (didnt see any tourists there except for us). Later we went further down Nathan road and found the tourist market where we found the same stuff for 50% higher price Lots of small local restaurants with great food but you have absolutely no idea what to order so make sure there are other people eating so you can just ask for what they are having!! If you want to go down to the Star Ferry to watch the night light show catch the double decker bus number 1 or 2 from Nathan Road HK$4.40 (HK$2.20 concession) Free internet in room.

Rooms are a lot smaller than I thought. We were unlucky to get the room at the corner when the space were cut off half by the door. The moment we open the door, we had to jump on the bed so that the other person can come in. Toilet is tiny, too. The shower place is practically 2x2 big. When you shower, the shower curtain tends to stick to your body. That's how small it is.Nevertheless, it's clean and bed & pillow are comfy as well. It also comes with the basic ameneties. As to get there, it's not as near as it stated from the Prince Edward MTR. You'll have to cross 2 or 3 streets to get there which takes about 10mins. It's not exactly near when you are lugging a big luggage or just came back from a whole day sightseeing and shopping. Lastly, a more friendly staff would be a plus. They were not really that accomodating and helpful.

They were rude to me and rude to my friend who is a local here. When I called the front desk to ask for help finding an adapter so I could use my computer and other things that require electricity the staff member that answered the phone was really rude, hung up on me and never brought the adapter. I had to call back later and talk to someone else to get one. For the last two days of my stay the water in the shower and sink disappeared. There would be a few lucky moments where if I was fast I could get a shower, but I had to be fast or the water would turn off. The staff apologized but offered no explanation or solution to the problem. The shower was a real problem, it just had a flimsy curtain and tiny lip on the floor to keep all the water in. It never does keep the water in though and the floor is always completely flooded. My shower also had a problem where the cord for the shower head had several leaks so the water pressure was minimal and a lot of water was being lost that way. It seemed really wasteful to me. For the price of a room I would not stay here again, I'm sure I could find something better for that price.", "Date": "January 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cWould stay here again\u201d", "Author": "minghui79", "ReviewID": "UR50327596", "Content": "We stayed at the Oriental Lander Hotel for 3 nights during our recent HK vacation. Located about 5 minutes by foot from the Prince Edward MTR Station, the hotel was tricky to find at first. However, after familiarise ourselves with the local neighbourhood, it was a breeze for the rest of our stay. The hotel is tucked into the quiet Tong Mei Street opposite the Mongkok Fire Station. The immediate neighbourhood was quiet at night which gave us a peaceful 3 nights stay. Checking in at the hotel at 2pm, the process was fuss free. I like that they had already written down our names in our breakfast coupons prior to our arrival. As expected with most HK hotels, our twin bedroom was very small, yet good enough for 2 of us. The toilet was tiny but it was very clean and well stocked with toiletries. An in-room safe was provided with a functional plasma cable TV. Our beds were very comfortable. The minor drawback were that there was no mini fridge and there were no complimentary drinking water available. The complimentary breakfast was always a plus but it was a mixed affair. There was one morning when we arrived at the cafe at 9am only to find the lights off even though it was clearly stated that the breakfast hours would be until 10.30am. This aside, we liked our stay with the Oriental Lander. The service at the hotel was never outstanding in my opinion. But they were not rude either. They were willing to listen to our queries but it would be good if they were more welcoming.", "Date": "November 30, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Oriental Lander Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d1528911-Reviews-Oriental_Lander_Hotel-Hong_Kong.html", "Price": "$84 and up*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">No.206 Tongmi Road, Mong Kok, Kowloon</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Hong Kong</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">China</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1528911", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/7e/26/7e264abbf8f8919d1ab2e4f1060c42631large.jpg"}}
