This hotel is a few blocks form the Castro Pretoriano stop on the blue line. However, the immediate area was lacking in any enticing restaurants or other amenities. We did not feel completely safe walking around in the vicinity except when near the armed guards for the consulates across the street. Our biggest complaint was the utterly rude and unhelpful staff at the reception desk. Upon check-in we were not given the remote control necessary to operate the A/C and he held our passports with no explanation. Later in our stay, I asked if he could assist us in making 2 dinner reservations. He looked at me like I had three heads, then informed me I would have to pay him for the 3 local phone calls he reluctantly made. Since I was not expecting this I told him I would have to bring the 0.60 cents to him on our way out to dinner in a hour, and he expressed concern that I might not get it to him before his shift ended at 11 pm. Another time, we had to wait for the attendant to finish his cell phone conversation outside before we could retrieve our room key (which they required us to leave with them). I do wish to say that the one female desk attendant was always willing to help and she was friendly, but spoke poor English. (The hotel's website advertises \"multilingual staff\".) We were not happy with the selection at breakfast and the other reviewer who compared the waitress to a member of the Addams Family was not far off. We didn't mind the basement setting but it was deathly quiet in there. The room was dirty and had some problems. The bed was seriously lumpy and the sheets coarse. The armoire door did not stay closed. The hairdryer was coming unattached from the wall and got far too hot to hold after a few minutes. There was a white stain on the extra blanket that I could not bring myself to identify. Worst of all, the toilet could barely flush and took several tries to get just toilet paper to go down.

The elevator was too small to even fit a large suitcase. The hotel was older, and felt similar to a hostel. Our room was a bit musty and hot (mid-winter so the heaters were cranking), so we opened the nice veranda double windows, and it airred out nicely. The room was small and old, with very old furniture. It had two twin mattresses (this is called a 'double' in Europe) on a weak bedframe. The AC did not work, but they probably disconnect it in the winter. The bathroom in our room was actually large, newer, and quite nice and was the highlight of the room. The shower stall was small though, but I find this common all over Europe. The walls and door were thin, but we didn't hear anything. Breakfast downstairs was nice with plenty of choices. It kind of felt like an underground bunker or dungeon. The selection of meats and cheeses with bread, fruit, cereal and hard boiled eggs was good. As far as location, this hotel is not in any kind of tourist area! You can take the subway, which is only 2 or 3 blocks away to the Colosseum (3 stops), so that was nice.
