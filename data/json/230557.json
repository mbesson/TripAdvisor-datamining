The fridge in the room had enough space for us to put our own drinks , but all the mini bar drinks were only 2 euros each! Breakfast was typical continental fare, lots of fruit, bread, cereals, pastries, cheese and meats - no toast and no hot food, but more than adequate. There were lots of shops and restaurant in easy walking distance of the hotel and it was very handy as a touring base, being in walking distance of all the major attractions except the Vatican and only a short walk to the Termini and tour bus stops. All in all I would have no problem recommending this hotel as a base for your stay in the beautiful city that is Rome.", "Date": "July 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cA wonderful hotel\u201d", "Author": "Ezziem", "ReviewID": "UR8115660", "Content": "I booked a double room for the first two nights, and was very happy with the room and the assistance from the front desk.

Average service with average amenities. Nothing in the decor would allude to the fact that you are in Rome.

Fortunately, we were able to work around this and didn't have a problem getting into either place.

The location was excellent, about a 5 minute walk from the Terminus just off Via Cavour. The room was clean and well maintained. The view was off the back of another building, but that is quite common in Rome. After a long train journey to Rome, we went straight for a drink from the minibar, which we thought was very good value at \u20ac2 per item. The hotel is about a ten minute walk from the Colosseum ( straight down via cavour) and there are a few nice restaurants on Via Cavour also. You can also reach the Spanish Steps and the Trevi fountain quite easily. The staff in the hotel were friendly, especially the concierge that was on duty when we arrived and left. He spoke excellent english and was very helpful with directions etc. He also arrange a transfer to the airport for \u20ac48 in a well maintained mercedes. The breakfast was continental , however it did the job. There was a small residents bar, with an eccentric but nice barman ( i think he was covering for the normal guy), there was also an Irish bar around the corner with live bands most nights. In summary the hotel was in a good location, clean , reasonably priced and the staff were nice, we would stay there again.", "Date": "May 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Raleigh, North Carolina, USA", "Title": "\u201cGood place to stay, convenient to the sights\u201d", "Author": "adbracey", "ReviewID": "UR4827830", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel as part of a package from Air France Holidays.

We had no view but the back of another building...but it was quiet. This is very close to the train station but virtually nothing else. Breakfast is 7-10 but we went to breakfast the 1st day at 9AM and they were virtually out of everything...even plates! We do not watch much TV while traveling but do turn on the news occasionally while dressing. The small (13\"?) TV was perched on top of the minibar under the window & difficult to see from that angle. The one good thing they do offer is a driver (48 euro) to take you to the airport.
