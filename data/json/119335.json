Bout a hour in to our stay the toilet over flooded, the room furniture was run down, scratched, the room had a disgusting odor, the bed was hard & very dirty, the door lock was loose & the air conditioner was missing the cover. <- this was all in the first room we had until the toilet incident they switched us rooms. The 2nd room was a little better, but the bed was a lot dirtier. Stains were on the mattress & mattress box. There was crumbs under the bed and sofa. The air conditioner was dirty. The next day we were gone all day & by the time we got back to the room we were tired & worn out. But then our keys didn't work which meant we had to walk down to lobby & wait for the front desk staff to open door & re scan our keys. Once we opened the doors to our surprise the room was still dirty. The housekeeping staff had not come by to our room & neighbors. for 2 nights we paid 181.62 in hopes we were getting a nice hotel. Before our trip we looked at the hotel photo gallery online & chose to stay here because of the way the motel was presented. Turns out this was the biggest mistake & a waste of our money! Your better off staying at a Red Roof Inn or any other hotel. I wish we got our money back but that was a long stretch of happening. Save your money & go for a nicer hotel experience!", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tucson, AZ", "Title": "\u201cNot Pleased\u201d", "Author": "Zfamily123", "ReviewID": "UR123500762", "Content": "We booked our room through Priceline and were very excited by the price we received. We contacted the hotel directly to request (2) beds in the room. We were informed that there was a $10 upgrade fee for that type of room. We were also informed that there was a sofa bed in the room we had, so it could accomodate our party without the upgrade fee. When we arrived to check-in, we were asked if we needed sheets for the pull-out bed and we were handed a fitted sheet and a flat sheet. We made the assumption that there would be blankets/pillows in the room. When we opened the door to our room, there was an overwhelming odor of cooked food. We turned on the fan immediately to help circulate the air and hopefully lessen the smell. The smell was still noticeable upon check-out the following morning. In the shower, when you pull up the button on the faucet to make the water come out of the shower head, a fairly steady stream of water continues coming out of the faucet, making the water pressure pretty pathetic from the shower head. When we pulled out the sofa bed, there were crumbs and dirt under the mattress. If you are unfortunate enough to be on the door-side of the room when you pull out the bed, you must literally crawl over the bed to get back to the other side of the room. Once we put the sheets onto the bed and crawled back to the other side of the room to look in the closet for blankets and pillows, we could only find one pillow. There are only 2 pillows on the standard bed, so you cannot borrow from there. We called down to the desk to request a blanket. We were told they ran out of blankets and we were offered a mattress pad or additional sheets. All in all, I have to say that the room was clean and it was very nice to have a full-size refigerator in the room. However, the mattresses on the pull-out, as well as the standard bed were terrible and the amenities are non-existent. The only thing in the bathroom is one hotel sized bar of soap. Be sure to bring all of your own toiletries! For $29.00 per night, which is the rate we received through Priceline, you cannot expect the Ritz, but you should at least be able to get a blanket, a shower that works properly, an odor free room and a path around a bed.", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cNot family friendly.\u201d", "Author": "Trayzus", "ReviewID": "UR120998407", "Content": "Staff was very nice and helpful, but the place is very run down and dirty.

I've made the \"just need a place to crash\" 2-star mistake before and at first I thought I made it again. Upon arrival it seemed obvious that this is the kind of place that caters to the likes of contract employees and workers sent out of town for a spell, based on the types of trucks and vehicles in the parking lot. The rooms are outside-access which I am not too fond of but typical for a 2-star. Inside, the room was pretty small but had a kitchenette with basic kitchen tools. Viewing the bed, I was concerned but it ended up being pretty comfortable. The pillows were mediocre. The bathroom looked as though they had recently installed hardwood laminate (or whatever that woodgrain tile stuff is called) and the tub and toilet looked new. The thing that struck me was that the room was very, very clean. The room smelled good too. No smoke and no cheap room freshners. The towels looked, felt and smelled fresh and safe. Did not get any creepy vibes. Air conditioning was a wall unit but ice cold. Early in the morn you could hear the workers heading out but in no way were they too loud. In the morning I was able to check out the lobby and it was nice and clean. Very pleasant and the desk clerk was awesome, helping with maps and internet access. She was an example of awesome customer service. The *only* suggestion I have is that they clean the outside ash cans. The one at the top of our stairs had about 200 butts in it and was sort of gross. Otherwise, this was a great 2-star to crash at or if you need a basic exteneded stay residence.", "Date": "October 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "chapel hill nc", "Title": "\u201cBasic\u201d", "Author": "caplow", "ReviewID": "UR30088986", "Content": "My company booked me into the ESA on E Oak because of the low cost.

King bed, Pull out sofa bed, desk; tiny but adequate bath room with tub/shower (good water pressure) and separate sink vanity area. There were no amenities other than tiny soap bars and tissues - no shampoos, etc. Kitchen was minimal with 2 burner cook top, small microwave, and full size refrig., 4 cup coffee maker with coffee packs on demand; table and two chairs. Kitchen utensils were minimal. TV with Dish cable service (2 Showtime movie channels). They did not offer any even marginal breakfast. \"Fitnes Center\" was a tiny room with a treadmill and exercise bicycle. Swimming pool was tiny. pay laundry on site. Can't beat the location if you have business near the airport or on that side of town - just across from a shopping center with Costco, Fry's, Target, and chain restaurants. I have to admit that I was comfortable and the accommodations served my purpose - but for $60/night you can probably do better. For a little more you can stay at the Marriott Residence Inn just a bit south of here - and I would certainly opt for that if my wife was traveling with me.", "Date": "May 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern California", "Title": "\u201cBetter Than Expected\u201d", "Author": "Ninee", "ReviewID": "UR27312720", "Content": "Our reason for being in Phoenix was for our father having heart surgery at Banner Good Samaritan.

The hotel allows you to park there for FREE while you are gone provided you stay at their hotel atleast one night. They also provide free shuttle service to and from the airport. Our room the first night was a queen-size and was sub-standard. Too small and the bed was hard and there was only one nightstand and lamp so the other person in the room could not read in bed. Rug was in shabby condition. Sofa was tiny. Not very nice at all. Upon our return we did not intend to stay, but were too tired once we got back to pick up our car. The front desk clerk was not the smilingest I have ever come across (and having been a motel manager for 23 years, I have seen a lot of them), but she was very helpful and went out of her way to find us the best rate available and this time we paid a bit more (see why below) but we also agreed to pay even $10.00 more on top of that to be upgraded to a king room, end unit which was much larger and nicer. Full size sofa this time. Bathrooms still small, but adequate for one night. Burnt out bulb in bedside table this time, but that was the only complaint about lighting, as there were two nightstand and two bedside lamps in this larger room. Carpet a bit better than the previous room. The rooms was so large it was equipped with two air conditioners which adequately cooled it quickly as the a/c had not been on when we arrived. Rates were reasonable both stays, but it seems the hotel was sold during the week we were away and new managment might greatly increase the prices (which is why the price was higher the second time as they had already raised them some) which would perhaps not make it such a desirable place to stay as what brought us to the hotel were the rates. The hotel has no restaurant but is two minutes driving away from an Applebee's and large shopping centre for those last minte holiday necessities - there was a Costco, Target, Ross and many, many more shops in the same shopping centre. Would recommend it if you request a king-room and the rates do not go too much higher. They DO give you a nice complimentary breakfast where you can even make your own waffles! Also nice, small kitchen area in the room which we did not use.", "Date": "October 14, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Extended StayAmerica Phoenix-Airport-E Oak St", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g31310-d119335-Reviews-Extended_StayAmerica_Phoenix_Airport_E_Oak_St-Phoenix_Arizona.html", "Price": "$64 - $74*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">4357 East Oak Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Phoenix</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">AZ</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">85008</span></span> (Formerly Wellesley Inn)</span></span></address>", "HotelID": "119335", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/ae/09/ae09badd61b37f276cedc8faacafea5f4large.jpg"}}
