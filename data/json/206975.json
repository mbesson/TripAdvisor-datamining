It is few metro stop from the centrum, so if you are a tourist looking for good and nice price hotel, these one is recommended. HOTEL: The lobby is very simple, the person front desk are amable, except for one, that is kind of rude, they have a breakfast also recommended if they offer you the promotion off 50% off, if they offer you for full price forget about it, go outside and have breakfast in one of the caf\u00e9. The breakfast have scramble eggs, sausage, sort of breads and pastry, ham, cheese, fruit, coffee, milk and chocolate powder. The hole place is very well keep it, and have 4 elevator, that will keep you run in even in rush-hours. THE ROOM: It is a very nice and big room, will flat tv, minibar, airco, security box, toiletries amenities and extra blankets and pillows. The room was clean and made every day, also if you choose to they will change your towels every day. CONCLUSION: If you are looking for a place outside of the center, good quality-price relation, and still close enough to take either cab or metro and be there in 5 to 6 minutes, or even walking, these is your place.", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "cairo", "Title": "\u201cNice location, old facility\u201d", "Author": "David R", "ReviewID": "UR132701296", "Content": "NH is nicely located near the center of Madrid and at the same time with easy access to the highway. the rooms and hotel are nice. but the facility is a bit old. for instance there's only two power outlets in the room.", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milan, Italy", "Title": "\u201cClose to Plaza Espana\u201d", "Author": "PATRACLEO", "ReviewID": "UR130630027", "Content": "This hotel is 5 min. walking distance from Plaza de Espana, and close to chopping centers.

There are quieter rooms away from the front, but the hotel was full so I could not be moved. If your place of work is away from the centre, you would do better to stay nearby.

First initial problem was that I was hoping to pay in cash but the hotel said it was already paid when i booked it months ago. This was not true and I had taken out the money at a favourable exchange rate a month before so now I was going to have to pay at 1 euro to the pound!!!! So I forgot about that until I got home. The room - I stayed the 26th-29th of December and all I can say is the walls and ceilings were paper thin. You could hear the cleaners crashing about and moving furniture in the mornings, people flushing toilets, taking showers, talking. The road noise was acceptable because of double glazing, but there werent any blinds to pull down and the curtains didn't close fully letting in an annoying beam of light. For me I can sleep through most noises and light levels but my girlfriend hates it and she just could not sleep and because she was restless she kept me awake!! This is unacceptable for hotel that actually charges much more than i paid so I feel quite relieved in one respect! So I returned home late in the morning and checked my bank account..no money had been taken out. Next day I checked it again and there it was money taken by the Hotel not Booking.com. So that made me overdrawn and another 22 quid charges. Overall I would avoid this hotel unless you like noise, bright light and not being given the choice of how to pay (cash,card etc)", "Date": "January 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cPossibly the worst nh Hotel in the chain?\u201d", "Author": "Hotel_traveller32", "ReviewID": "UR13114566", "Content": "Hello travellers, A few rants on this hotel so please bear with me. I arrived at this hotel a day before my partner and was told i could not check-in because my name was not on the booking, i apologised for not letting them know but was still refused even though i had all the documentation for my stay. i was informed by the 'reception manager' that i could not check-in because i could be a TERRORIST. What is the world coming too. i eventually got my partner on the phone and was allowed to check-in (he could have been anybody on the phone) it was quite comical. i was then told i couldnt have a double room because they had all been given away. i booked a double but was refused. once again the most charming reception manager told me \"NO ROOM IS GUARANTEED\" although it does say it is on website, so i had to change rooms for the second night. the rooms are small, the interior rooms are even smaller, so if you choose to stay here do not accept an \"interior room\" there is nothing to do in the hotel, room service is 12 hours a day, no restaurant, laundry on weekends. breakfast is nice and so is the power shower. i wouldnt recommend this hotel to anybody. the staff are incredibly rude and think all customers are an annoyance!!!! if you read my other reviews on hotels i have been very genuine, and im genuine on this one too. maybe i look into it a little more because i am also been a mystery shopper, which does annoy me a little in life cos im always on the lookout. if you need anymore information on this hotel please email me and i will be happy to answer your questions as best i can.

Only 25-30 minutes from the airport (an evening journey, I might add) the hotel occupies a convenient location, being served by an abundance of taxis, and only a short stroll from the nearby \u2018Arguelles\u2019 or \u2018San Bernardo\u2019 Metro stations. The rooms are of an excellent standard, and appear to be regularly (and thoroughly) maintained. The only drawback is the paper-thin walls and proliferation of wooden floors, which meant that, during my stay, the tip-tapping of high heels and the dull drone of a wheeled suitcase could be easily heard from the floor above, not to mention the amorous couple in the room next door! Annoyingly, the \u201cdouble\u201d bed comprised two single beds shoved together, which kind of took away the point, but nevertheless, the mattress and pillows were very comfortable. Wi-fi is available in all of the rooms, but sadly (and all too commonly) at an extortionate cost. The mini-bar was well-stocked with a variety of products \u2013 at least for the first night that is. On a number of occasions, I had to ask for it to be re-stocked (with water, I might add \u2013 nothing stronger!). This was slightly annoying as it led to some confusion as to what items I had taken that day and what items had still to be re-stocked! Nevertheless, this was swiftly resolved by the very efficient staff, and the itemised bill at the end of my stay seemed to add up correctly. Breakfast was served in the someone soulless restaurant (the views obscured by that bloody petrol station again!), although a wide range of hot and cold buffet items more than made up for it. I never actually tried the restaurant in the evening, so I cannot vouch for the atmosphere at that time of day, although the bar always seemed somewhat under-used and it closed very early for a hotel. Overall, I would say that the three stars awarded to this hotel are pretty much justified. The hotel is a little rough around the edges perhaps in places, but overall I enjoyed a very satisfying stay at a convenient, well-run establishment.", "Date": "May 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cOk the first night but noisy the second\u201d", "Author": "SoHappyTraveller", "ReviewID": "UR7368324", "Content": "I stayed in the Alberto Aguilera for 2 nights on a business trip.
