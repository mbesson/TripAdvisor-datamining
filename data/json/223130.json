We chose the Spring Hill Suites due to its close proximity to the cruise ship port and it did not disappoint! Upon first getting to the hotel, most travelers will feel that it is in a \"not so good\" part of town, but this is not the case. It gives this impression because the buildings directly surrounding the hotel are a bit run down - definitely not a glitzy area of N.O. You'll quickly realize that this area is frequented heavily by locals (due to the 2 night clubs that are located to the east side of the hotel). Needless to say, the N.O. police tend to patrol this area frequently as it has a ton of foot traffic/party-go-er's at night. Even at night, we felt safe walking around the areas surrounding the hotel. Check in was a breeze. The staff was nice and helpful. We stayed on the 4th floor east side. The hotel's layout can be somewhat confusing. So either bring a compass or pay attention to the signs directing you to your room...... The view from our room was to the east, so we had a view of the nightclubs. This made for some interesting people watching at night...... :) The room itself was very spacious and clean. The beds were very comfortable (beds are a bit on the soft side - the way we like them). Just about the only complaint I have about the room was that it needed a new iron. Overall a great room! The hotel's public spaces are spacious, kept clean, and are well maintained. The continental breakfast is what you would expect a continental breakfast to be. Nothing fancy here, but still good. Be aware that there is a per day fee for parking at this property ($20 bucks plus taxes of $2.40 per day). The parking feels secure, but is a bit annoying. For one, the spaces are cramped - so pray that you find parking next to someone that takes the time to park correctly :) ........ Also, the hotel staff does NOT do a good job of preventing guests from using the only entryway to the hotel as a vehicle loading/unloading/exit area. When this happens, it creates a bottleneck for guests attempting to get into the hotel and therefore creates backups that spill out from the hotel's entrance and into the street. If any of the hotel's management personnel are reading this, please ask your staff to monitor this and not allow it to happen! Anyway, all in all a good stay. Just a few annoyances.....

Check in around 3:00 p.m. was met by no one at the desk and finally after calling out two to three times help arrived. The actual check in was easy and the room was clean and neat. The style of the interior looked early 70's style. The suite had a two queen size bed and a sofa and chair. There was a 32\" TV and it was mounted on a stand/small dresser between where the two beds were located and the semi-room with the sofa(pull out bed) and chair. This side of the room also has a microwave, refrigerator, sink, desk and chair. Unfortunately when the sofa bed is pulled out the amount of room left between the TV stand and pull out bed is minimal. The amount of drawer space is also minimal. The bathroom is quite nice with the tub and toilet separated from the sink. Every morning there is a free breakfast with scrambled eggs, sausage or Canadian bacon, waffles, cereal, yogurt, fruit, coffee, juice and tea. I found the pool small and inadequate, however the whirlpool and exercise room are better choices. Parking especially on the weekend was quite tight and could be a problem. Remember parking cost $20,00 a night. This is a good property in an area I believe will only improve with time. Unfortunately I believe the layout of the rooms leave something to be desired.

Every morning at the very nice breakfast, despite the standing room only turnout at times, the ladies that kept the food stocked (nothing ever ran out) were smiling at the least. One of the ladies seemed to always be singing. Besides the folks behind the counter and the breakfast staff, housekeeping was efficient. They did a great job with our room and when you saw them in the hall they too were always cheerful. Because we were in New Orleans for one of the conventions, having only a 2 block walk to the convention center was GREAT! Many of the folks I attended the convention with had to walk a number of blocks. One may think that with such close proximity to the convention center the price to park would come at a premium. Well, think again. While I wasn't excited about paying $20 a day for parking, I talked to several folks who paid $30 or more per day.....and they had no idea where there car even was! One person said that they were told that their car was about 6 blocks away! Not at SpringHill Suites. I parked my car myself in the on-site garage and I could come and go as much as I wanted. Of course no one should go to New Orleans without taking in the culture of the French Quarter. Though we did drive the few blocks and pay to park, you really would not have to do that.

Bear in mind these are not suites, so there's just a tiny divider between the king bed and the sofabed with 1 large flatscreen TV in the middle that swivels. Breakfast is included here, and the choices are typical for this type of Marriott property, so if you crave a real southern breakfast you should probably head out of the hotel. But if, like me, you just want some coffee and yogurt to start your day, this is fine. (I was saving room for all that JazzFest food!) The staff in the breakfast area is cheery and helpful and keeps things running smoothly and cleanly. Front desk staff was competent and polite. To those who say that they are not good at making dining recommendations I say, really, can you blame them? They're working in a Marriott, which usually trains employees to be careful about making recommendations outside the hotel. Plus, you're in NOLA! The choices are overwhelming and you can't expect a hotel employee to suss out your dining preferences and budget, better to check on here or Yelp for advice. The location is excellent, 2 blocks from convention center in the heart of the Warehouse District. Yes, there is a taxi stand right outside the door, which was very convenient for us JazzFesters ($5 per person to the Fairgrounds and yeah, why not share a cab with complete strangers? Makes for a fun ride and better for the environment.) As for cabs to French Quarter, there are better options: 1. You can walk it, it's about a mile or 2. If you walk down to the Convention Center and turn down it's side on Julia Street there is a Streetcar!! It runs up and down the waterfront all the way to Frenchman Street. They come about every 5-10 minutes and cost $1.25 (exact change recommended but not mandatory). There are stops about every 4 blocks, so you can get off at French Market, Dumaine or Frenchmen or other streets. The driver of one told me they run from 8am-10pm 7 days a week. And for those who say the area around the hotel is sketchy at night I say: This is a big city! All big cities get a little sketchy at night! So don't wear your diamonds or carry all your money, be aware of your surroundings and you'll do fine. We had no issues. There is a nightclub across the street from the hotel - Republic of New Orleans - it has excellent music shows but if you don't want to hear noise at night on weekends, request a room on the quiet side of the hotel (we did, and it was very quiet). Silver lining is you can go to a show there and stagger home to the Springhill and crash out-no need for transportation at all!

It's only about eight blocks to the French Quarter from the hotel at St. Joseph @ St. Peter in the Warehouse District and a bit shorter to Harrah's casino. There is also good access to the riverfront trolley (tracks behind the Riverwalk and between it and the river) to take you to the French Quarter and back if you tire of walking.

The segregated sleeping area was large and the bed very comfortable. The bathroom area was nicely sized with a tub/shower combo and commode in a closed area and an open vanity with sink nearby. A roomy closet with iron/board was handy. The large, flat screen TV was nice but situated between a sitting area with a sofa and the bedroom so the sight line from the bedroom was a little less than idea as the TV could not swivel much. A large courtyard area was rather non-descript. The trio of elevators were roomy and worked well. We took the train so parking was not an issue for us. The area was safe and vibrant with nightlife but not in the hotel so things were pretty peaceful within its walls. We were catching a cruise on a Saturday and were very glad we chose this hotel as the cruise terminal was very accessible by walking with moderate luggage. The new terminal was a mess, jammed with traffic and people. Some were let out by their taxi drivers long before the terminal so they could avoid the traffic and seek other fares. Within five minutes of leaving our hotel, we arrived at the terminal after a very pleasant walk. We even had time to have one last po-boy at the dining area in the Riverwalk before boarding our ship while others were frantic and stuck in traffic.

The weather was unusally hot, even the locals were complaining. So New Orleans in August plus extreme heat and humidity, wow, quite the experience. The hotel was nice, the floor we were on (4th) recently remodled so the room was very nice. The A/C was wonderful and thankfully worked very well. The suite was nice and big, but no true door between sleeping area and sitting area, so if you want to watch tv whlle your partner sleeps, it doesn't really work too well, plus the tv straddles the two rooms. Since you have to swivel the tv to watch it, you cannot watch from the bedroom and the sitting room at the same time.The one really negative about the room is no in room safe, so no place to secure your electronics while you are gone. The lobby really has no sitting area, only two chairs space on opposite ends of the room, but that may have been due to the renovations going on while we were there. The comp breakfast was so so and the hot entrees were always cold. Again, due to the renovatons going on, the breakfast was held in a meeting room as opposed to the dining room. The business center had four pc and two printers (one of the printers was not working while we were there). The staff were all nice and helpful. Nice small workout facility and indoor spa , however the outdoor pool was in a courtyard where you heard the roaring of the a/c units, not too relaxing, It felt like I was sitting on the runway at the airport, very loud. The hotel has a nice location. About 100 yard walk to the convention center and lots of good restaurants close by. Mulates was a wonderful place to go, good food and good cajun music. Harrahs casino was a short walk and riverwalk was close by as well. We took a cab to bourban street and did manage to walk back to our hotel.

Plus a desk with a nice leather chair with computer docking station. The towels were kind of sorry but over all it was clean and not a bad value. We paid $141 a night. They had a hot breakfast. My gripe about the breakfast was that the grits were lumpy but other than that it was a well rounded breakfast selection. There were a few restaurants in the immediate area. We walked five blocks to catch the trolly to see St. Charles Street (and the supposedly million dollar homes which wasn't much to look at) and we ended up on Bourbon street and had a great time.

The toilet had a ring around it so it had not been cleaned in quite a while. The chair and ottoman that was in the room was so soiled that I wouldn't even sit in it!

I definitely think Marriott needs to take a look at this hotel and either update (and clean) it up or consider closing it.

The other young lady sympathized with me and said the only reason they did not want early check-in was b/c the parking was not available on the proprety but as long as I put some money in the meter I was fine and prceeded to alow me to check-in and since I confirmed I should be allowed to check-in. I came down at 3:30PM to move my car on the property and they advised that still no parking on the property for $20 a day and I would have to valet for $30 a day and only allowed to use my car once a day and if I used my car a 2nd time it would be $10 for each trip. So I went ahead and valet parked and asked if I can check on the next day to park on the property for $20 a day. They said no problem. The next day, I checked at 11:00 about the parking and the lady at the front desk advised she was still checking out guest and had not had a chance to look at the list but to check back.

I tried to change hotels during my stay but the convention center meeting had taken almost all other hotels. Look out for this place - here are a few of many reasons: 1. Their \"light touch\" housekeeping policy, which you won't find out about until after you've checked in. This means that once you're checked in, the only houskeeping you'll get is to have your bed made without changing sheets, used towel replaced and the wastebasket emptied on weekdays only. No clean sheets, no vacuuming, etc. On weekends there is nothing! I discussed this policy with the front desk and pointed out that the initial room rate included (I hope) clean sheets and a full room cleaning but this policy meant they were providing less service without decreasing the room rate. The response I got was \"Well, we're not a full service hotel - and we're not treating you unfairly, nobody gets clean sheets.\" Had I known, I never would have booked there. 2. Other glaring deficiencies - no facial tissues at all, only one small wastebasket, only a few cheap plastic hangers in the closet and some were broken, rough toilet paper, bathroom wall had a large crack through the tile from its top down to the tub, etc. 3. Upon my arrival at 5PM, I was told my room wasn't ready because \"Some people from housekeeping decided they didn't want to work here anymore.\" and I could wait in the lobby. Excuse me - management's problems belong to them, not to the guests. 4. The 2 chairs and the couch in the lobby were so tired looking and their arms were so slick with dirt that I couldn't bring myself to even drape my sportcoat over one and decided to walk around outside instead. 6. Upon check out on Tuesday, 8:00 AM, no one was at the front desk - only the 'chief engineer' fixing something. He said he didn't know how to do check out but \"They'll be right back.\" One half hour later, no one back yet and he felt so bad he said \"I'll try, I don't know where they are.\" 7. The 'pool' was \"closed for construction\" - but the only way to find out was to ask. Never a \"Sorry for the inconvenience.\" Lest you think all was negative - here's the positive I could find: there was a hairdryer in the room and an iron and ironing board in the closet - I know the hairdryer worked, didn't try the iron.", "Date": "November 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Delaware", "Title": "\u201cJust right!\u201d", "Author": "Schotzy", "ReviewID": "UR10640496", "Content": "I stayed here for three nights for a convention being held at the convention center, which is just two blocks away.

It's a pretty healthy walk to Harrah's, Canal Street (shopping, souvenirs, other hotels, restaurants) and to Bourbon Street (probably a good 10-15 minute hike), but other than that I was quite pleased. Parking is expensive ($15/day), but parking tickets are more expensive, so it depends how far you want to look around. A word about Harrah's - NOT A GOOD PLACE TO GAMBLE. Harrah's is the only land-based casino allowed in New Orleans by law. They won the bid, so they have no other competition in the area and they know it. They don't have to loosen their slots or care whether you win or not. Riverboat casinos are not even allowed to dock at the nearby River Walk. Don't waste your time and throw away your money gambling at Harrah's New Orleans. I suggest the Treasure Chest, a smaller floating casino located outside New Orleans. Otherwise, go to Las Vegas or better yet, give the money to charity. Harrah's is OK to eat at, however, and they have good breakfasts. I don't recommend the local MacDonald's on Canal Street either. As the cheapest place to eat in town, they also get a lot of derelicts, street people, and unsavory characters in there.

The sitting area, work area, and kitchen area were comparable in layout and size to other Springhill Suites where I have stayed. The staff could not have been more accommodating and friendly.

The hotel has a small outdoor pool in a nice courtyard setting. We did not use the pool but had a pool view from our room and saw others using it. The expanded continental breakfast was convenient. They probably could have used another person preparing food to handle the convention rush, but when they ran out of prepared fresh fruit, they fixed more right away upon our request.
