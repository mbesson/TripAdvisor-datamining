The room was very luxurious and although there wasn't a separate room for a sitting area - do you really need one? Bathroom included large bath, great shower and separate WC area. I thought it was good value for money given the size and spec of the room and its central location - you'd pay twice as much for the equivalent in central London. The staff couldn't have been more helpful and had a seemingly endless list of restaurant recommendations. We didn't have a single bad meal and again I was pleasantly surprised by the prices. A very fancy five course tasting menu at \"Life\" on Via Vita (lobster and the full works) including five glasses of wine each came to 130 Euros for two. Maybe I'm too used to the prices in London but I thought that was good value. Beware of the shops.

After a great deal of research I took the plunge and book Babuino 181 because it looked well located and good value for money and, of course, it has been well reviewed on here! I am pleased to say that it was a good decision. As other reviewers have said this is not a 'full service' hotel simply an elegant selection of rooms and suites conveniently situated on a high end shopping street between two metro stations (Flaminio and Spagna) and 50 yards from a taxi rank. We were well greeted on arrival and shown to our room. A good sized deluxe room with a well appointed bathroom that had a big deep bath and boy, was I pleased to sink into that bath after a hard day pounding the pavements of Rome! My only word of caution is that the bath is quite low down and the door to the shower very narrow so if you are someone on the larger side you may find using these facilities a little difficult. The toiletries provided are good quality and plentiful with lovely big bars of soap not the slivers that are the norm in most hotels. The front of house staff were very helpful. They recommended Edy's a very local trattoria for our evening meal. I am pleased to say it was only five minute walk for my tired legs and we enjoyed a fairly simple but pleasant enough meal that was reasonably priced. Breakfast was included in our room rate. It came on a tray to our room. We ordered the 'healthy' breakfast and the 'continental' breakfast and it was more than enough for us. We had fabulous fresh orange juice, fresh fruit and cereal as well as a good selection of pastries and coffee. All in all we had a very comfortable stay. On our last day they looked after our luggage and we were able to take advantage of coffee and biscuits in their small first floor lounge whilst we freshened up for our journey home.

We had a deluxe suite 50 sq meters. I think this was one of the best rooms from my travels in Europe. Here is why 1. Excellent bathroom- two sinks - a great tub (yes I used it) and a spacious shower cubicle. The WC area is not cramped behind a door as one often sees in Europe. Better than the pics on the website show you. Airy and spacious and the styling is really excellent - contemporary chic, earthy colors - lovely mosaic on the wall. Great toilet amenities and enough robes/towels - (the weighing scale was innacurate though !) 2. Spacious and comfortable room - very cleverly designed. Enough wardrobe space - including hanging space and drawers. And great place for keeping your suitcases (we had 2 large ones and one small) - not the clumsy racks you get at most hotels. Overall for the comfort, elegance, space and design - I would give this room 10/10 3. Location - right next to Piazza Del Poppolo is wonderful. So many bars, restaurants, shops around that you will never miss the common areas which a more traditional hotel has, but this does not (It does have one nice room one can use if one wishes) 4. Front Desk Staff: They were friendly and efficient and more than willing to help. They arranged 2 lovely tours for us on short notice (Vatican and Ancient Rome). And also made restaurant recomendations and reservations. The drop off to the airport - S class merceded for 60 Euros is also a lovely idea. In fact they had been in touch with us immediately after we had booked and were very helpful and responsive. 5. Breakfast in bed - thats great - i love it. why would you want to go down for breakfast when you can get it in bed. Having said that the breakfast selection is limited. Also a wonderful surprise - our minibar was included in our rate - we didn't pay for our water and cookies/chips A word of clarification: As you would have seen in the other reviews this is not a classic hotel with a big lobby or tons of staff to fuss over you. The space is top class - stylish and better than what you would see at the top hotels. But there are no substantial common areas. I was apprehensive about this but after having stayed there I can say with confidence that given the location and all it has to offer as soon as you walk out the door - I don't think anyone would miss these common areas. I would also like to add that in Rome you see a lot of rich/classical architechture/art all around you. So having a hotel room which is contemporary in its styling offers relief. In fact I believe that the contemporary style of the hotel offers itself to be juxtaposed with the more traditional styles one sees in the city, and this actually helps you appreciate the latter even more. This is a subtle but in my view important point. I also think that overall it is better to stay in this area rather than in the veneto area which is above the steps (Spanish Steps). Most of the grand old hotels are in the Via Veneto area which is a bit \"dull\" in my view compared to the streets below the steps. Finally don't miss Pincio garden just minutes away- its a wonderful place to relax and get some open space Keep it up Babuino !!", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyable stay\u201d", "Author": "JohnHenryH", "ReviewID": "UR125516214", "Content": "We had two rooms on the same floor for ourselves and two adult children. we were able to get one room early as we arrived around lunch time, was appreciated. we were shown to our room and bags were handled well.

When we returned to our Room the TV was not working, so I called the concierge they repaired the fault within 20 minutes, however after the repair during the night the Sky box that was fixed fell from its mounting onto the desk below the tv hitting the top lid of my apple MacBook and cracking the screen. After a quick discussion with the concierge in the morning I was surprised when the very friendly manager turned up almost immediately and took my laptop for repair! Within 24 hours they had taken my laptop to repair at Apple Rome and replaced the screen. I was impressed to say the least and now I understand why they are number 4 on trip advisor. In my opinion they should be number 1. Breakfast was included in our room, and when my wife wanted a banana which didn't come with the Anerican Breakfast the hotel brought us a entire fruit basket! On leaving the hotel the hotel arranged a Mercedes car service for us at a very reasonable price, I checked several local taxi providers and \u20ac60 was very reasonable, as a regular taxi probably would have cost the same because we left at rush hour to the airport.

There was also a spacious living/dining area, an elegant bedroom, a well stocked bathroom, and a separate toilet. For European standards, the suite was huge, and being fairly high in the building, there was plenty of natural light. - EATING: Tea and coffee facilities are complimentary in the suite, and for coffee fans, there's a Nespresso machine. Snacks are available for a price. Breakfast is served in the room, and all you need to do is call reception and they'll bring it up in 10-15mins. There were a choice of 4 menus: diet, American, continental, and children's. Regardless of the menu you choose, it was a nice and varied selection of food; could have been a tad better with less prepackaged items, but it was substantial enough to last us a good number of hours. Complimentary tea, coffee, and cookies are also available in the lobby on the first floor. For restaurant suggestions/bookings, ask the concierge and they will happily help. Babette and Edy are literally on the sidestreets across the road - one left, one right, respectively. Both were great, but personally, my favourite was Babette (great service, great food). - LOCATION: Perfectly located in every way! The street it's on is called Via del Babuino, which is Rome's answer to London's Bond Street, and likewise, the Oxford and Regent Street equivalents are adjacent. My boyfriend and I walked to all our sights: + Piazza del Popolo is literally to the left of the hotel - a nice square to while your time away. + Turn right and the Spanish Steps are a mere 5mins' walk. + Vatican City took approx 20mins to get to because we wanted to walk along the river and cross the Bridge of Angels, but there were quicker routes via the more ordinary bridges. + Colosseum took no more than 30mins. - CONCLUSION: I loved my stay.. and I love Rome. Service was faultless and the location was fantastic. Every evening, I felt as though I was going back to my own apartment, and that can be quite hard to come by. IF I had to nitpick, then.. + Breakfasts could be more exciting. + The bath salts didn't get replenished on our last evening.. + Would have been easier viewing if the living area's TV was adjustable (i.e. rotatable). + Though it didn't really bother us as a couple, the spare toilet's door lock is faulty (forgot to mention to staff, sorry!).

The fresh orange juice was very full of pulp.The Philadelphia cream cheese felt a little out of place without a bagel. There are so many good Italian cheeses American ones are not needed. The restaurant Eddy was recommended . It was pleasant , close by and reasonably priced. The best restaurant we found was the Trattoria del Pantheon da Fortunato off the square near the Pantheon.

Service was great - all staff really friendly and helpful. Never stayed in a hotel that offers a 'turn down' service! Photos on the hotel website don't really do it justice - it looks even better when you see it. Location of hotel is perfect. It might look a bit far North on a map but we got round all the sights on foot. It's about a half hour walk to the colosseum or Vatican city with plenty of things to look at on the way. Comfy shoes are a good idea. Some people have mentioned the street noise but we didn't really notice it. The windows have shutters on the outside and inside, we only closed the inside ones and it was quiet enough. Breakfast is served in your room and you have a choice of diet, continental or American. We had continental one day and American the other. Both were pretty similar and both really nice. Kept us going until lunch time. The hotel recommended a nearby restaurant 'Edy'. Food was good, but service very laid back, and being a small restaurant on a Saturday night meant it was very busy and we had to wait a long time for the food. Don't let that put you off though. We also think it's worthwile having the hotel arrange a taxi. It's more expensive (\u20ac60) than getting a local taxi (\u20ac40 I think) or the train then tube, but you get picked up by a smart driver in a posh Mercedes and the experience of being whizzed through the centre of Rome is fun.", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paphos, Cyprus", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Boutique Hotel\u201d", "Author": "sandra s", "ReviewID": "UR121455145", "Content": "We have spent 3 days in this lovely boutique hotel.

We typically book two rooms and always ask for either an adjoining room if possible, or at least rooms in close proximity ( e.g., next to each other, across the hall). I can't tell you the number of times when we get to the hotel we are not even on the same floor. Such was the case for Babuino 181, one room on Floor 1 one on Floor 2. Now having said that, the hotel is small and the distance was not great, but there was a lot of running up and down stairs. This leads to one of the imperfections of Babuino 181, the front desk. After apologies about not having us together and after we were settled in and unpacked, the front desk informed us that we could be accommodated with rooms that could be made adjoining and that one of the rooms would be an upgrade at no extra charge. However, construction was going on outside the rooms. We thanked them and declined. Now let's start at the beginning. When our driver pulled up to the hotel and told us we were here, we looked around and said \"we are? where?\" He then pointed and said \"there.\" That is how unassuming the entrance to the hotel is. No large signs just a small designation to the front doors. You walk into a small, modern reception area. A small glass elevator at the back and stairs encircling it. Reception was pleasant, but a little confused, though that may have been due to language differences. The rooms were lovely and modern and relatively spacious. The bathrooms were definitely roomy. The second floor room faced the street, but the sound was blocked nicely. The first floor room faced a small side-street with restaurants, but outside noise levels were more pronounced, which is probably to be expected. There is no restaurant on the premises, but the hotel provided us with a nice breakfast on our request as we had an early morning tour set up. As far as location, it can't be beat. High end shops lined Via Babuino, and we were just up the street from the Spanish Steps. Most sights were within easy walking distance and though we took a taxi to the Vatican we were able to walk home with little trouble. Another thing to recommend Babuino 181 (and I regret that I can not remember her name) is the woman at the front desk who hails from Croatia. Extremely helpful with tips for dining and gelato and places to go and providing a warm smile and lovely conversation. Now on a negative note we had issue with house cleaning and some missing personal items. Apparently, \"Do Not Disturb\" signs do not pertain to house cleaning. We had run out in the morning to get a quick bite to eat and then prepare for our days touring. Both of our rooms had Do Not Disturb signs displayed and when we returned both rooms were being serviced. So we had to wait for them to finish before we could continue on plus we had personal items out that normally we would have put away or placed in the room safe. As it happens we later discovered that some of my daughter's personal items were missing. The two confused men at the front desk (those who checked us in with difficulty) weren't sure what to do and told us that house cleaning didn't arrive until 8 the next morning. We offered to go through the laundry, thinking that the items were scooped up with the sheets, ourselves, but were told that wasn't necessary that they would do it. After a nervous, sleepless night, house cleaning arrived and the items were found. Another thing we were not informed of by the front desk was that croissant's and muffins and a daily newspaper were provided free of charge in a small lounge off the first floor. This certainly would have saved us a very expensive breakfast at a nearby cafe. As you can see there are some glitches that still need to be worked out. Once that is done this will be a truly great find.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat boutique hotel in fabulous location\u201d", "Author": "WallStreet10005", "ReviewID": "UR117674441", "Content": "We spent two nights here the last week of August for a quick visit to Rome before heading south to the Amalfi Coast.

The nearest metro station is by the Spanish Steps and a cab ride from Roma Termini is around euro 15. In other words, the location is great!

The bathroom was huge and had a great walk-in shower and large bathtub. Finally, the art work was beautiful and the room just 'flowed' as the design and color coordination was speculator.

First and foremost the rooms are truly fantastic. Definitely large by Rome standards and designed with such skill and taste. We loved the spacious classy bathroom, warm woods, soft intricate lighting and especially the double pane windows and good soundproofing. Our room was a perfect getaway from the hustle and bustle and heat of Rome in the summer. Which brings me to the location - which is perfect. We've enjoyed staying near the Spanish Steps before but in that locale you're inundated with tourists day and night. The Babuino is still nearby and refreshingly close to the Piazza del Pololo which is a great meeting place in its own right, but when you leave the hotel you're not confronted with hordes of tourists every which way you turn. Moreover, the area is wonderfully chic with many of the latest small boutiques and restaurants within a few blocks. We really loved the area. The staff were very friendly and helpful and accommodated us in more ways than we could have asked. The only downside, if there is one, is the lack of any breakfast area and the availability of only a continental style breakfast. Although very good, we would have preferred a bit more choice and even a small room outside of your suite to eat breakfast. We had friends staying at the St. Regis and when they visited our room, the immediately wanted to change to our hotel. That says alot about the Babuiino.

Babuino 181, however, has plenty of it. You wouldn't think it from the humble facade and the petite entry and elevator, but the room we had (303) was large - even by US standards. The bathroom was completely renovated and well appointed. Also, important to note is the great AC. Since visiting Europe, we've realized that US air conditioning and EU air conditioning should not be considered equal. Babuino 181 knows what US A/C is all about, which is really important in August in Rome. A few other nice features included the innovative door locks, lighting system and in-room coffee maker - a must have for caffeine addicts like myself. Plus, Babuino is in the perfect location for shopping and seeing some of Rome's most beautiful places: Gucci, Fendi, Ferragamo. But seriously, there are great restaurants in this area and finding a cab takes just walking half a block to Piazza del Popolo. More importantly, getting a cab back only requires you tell your Italian cabbie \"Piazza del Popolo, which always seemed to please them (it's a cab stand - they get to rest some more while waiting on their next fare and Italians, if anything, love to rest). My reason for not giving a full five stars is the lack of amenities. I guess you can't have it all, space and services, but there is no fitness center, which you will truly need given the amount of food you'll be eating. And I had some difficulty in getting some laundry done. (We had been on a 10-day cruise before arriving and truly needed some fresh laundry.) The hotel's solution just didn't work for me, but I was able to locate a sweet Italian lady a couple of blocks away who was able to turn around my laundry in about 12 hours. Otherwise, a beautiful hotel with friendly staff - the chamber maids in particular were very sweet.

First thing we noticed in our room was the noise coming from the street \u2013 you could easily hear people talking outside, 4 floors down, not to even mention cars and other noises. It literally sounded like our window was open, but it was not. In the morning, we were woken by construction work right below us. I\u2019ve spent hundreds of nights at hotels in loud cities like New York, London, Paris and others, but this was actually the first time I had to switch rooms as I had trouble sleeping. Thankfully, we were able to change to a room located on the courtyard side which proved to be quieter. But even here, I could hear people talking next door, someone taking a shower behind the other wall and heavy footsteps from the room above ours. The AC made a loud humming sound even though it was turned OFF. This sort of noise inevitably takes a toll on the comfort of a hotel room. The breakfast, served in a tiny lounge room, was very limited. White toast, sweet croissaints, random fruit, coffee and water. The hotel is small though, so perhaps it\u2019s understandable. I\u2019m pretty sure we were told it\u2019s served until noon, but on one morning it was cleaned out at 11am. We booked through Tablet Hotels and paid around 300\u20ac a night, which I thought was decent for a boutique hotel. I noticed that their rack rates are \u20ac650-850, which is just ludicrously overpriced; \u20ac300 is the maximum I would consider paying. Service was good and friendly, design wise the hotel was appealing and the location is excellent.

However, significant evening street noise and a typically hard European mattress made sleeping difficult. Our rate included a nice continental breakfast delivered upon request each morning. They asked what we wanted, but it would have been helpfulif we had been provided with a list of what was available. Still the breakfast was very nice and, most times, promptly delivered. Unfortunately upon arrival found the only outlet in the bathroom broken. Reported it on several occasions over several days to no avail. Finally went down to the desk with wet hair one morning in frustration and got the attention of the manager who was appalled it hadn't been taken care of. Returned that afternoon to a complementary bottle of champagne (nice touch) and a working outlet, but found it odd that when we asked 2 days later the inn didn't have ice available to replenish our champagne bucket . Also washcloths weren't supplied in the bath on the first day (not unusual in Europe), but appeared on Day 2. However, we didn't get them again for the next several days. On our last evening I ran into the housekeeper and requested some, but was told there weren't any available. It was a little thing, but an inconsistency in service I found frustrating for a \"luxury\" inn.

The first day we ate in our room before we realised that we could just use the little reception area on the first floor right outside our room. We walked to the Coliseum which took about 45mins at a slowish stroll, the Spanish steps are just down the road and it's easy to get to the Vatican. My only issue was that we were on the 1st floor at the front and there was a fair amount of noise. It's a busy shopping street in the day, less so at night when the shops are shut. But being inner city there was an enthusiastic driver tooting his horn at 1am and street cleaning at 4am. The second night (Sunday) was quieter. A bottle or two of water at night would be a nice touch. The hotel were great in organising a car, which knew all the shortcuts and saved us a long wait on the motorway.

Lots of shopping and places to eat and drink all around. Basically, we spent almost four days eating, drinking, and walking. The room was very comfortable and decorated in a modern, Italian style and had some very thoughtful design touches not necessarily found in other hotels. It wasn't a huge room, but it was laid out pretty well. Loved the bed! It was an extremely comfortable, platform bed. The platform framed the matress an extra six or so inches, but it was cushioned so there was no fear of bumping into it. Nespresso coffee maker in the room with a full complement of coffees and teas. Free internet (and it worked!). Mounted flat screen with satellite had Italian channels, so not a lot of English channel choices, but it was fun watching reruns in Italian. Walk-in closet, with motion sensor lights. Light-blocking drapes, to include one for the door. Bathroom was very spacious and very clean. Separate tub and shower. Didn't use the tub, but it looked to be good-sized and it was very clean. The water pressure in the shower was fantastic! The toilet/bidet area had a sliding door to separate from the rest of the bathroom. There were motion sensor lights in the bathroom to act as a nightlight so there was no need to turn on the lights in the middle of the night. That was a nice design touch. Although the hotel is on a busy street, it was surprisingly quiet in the room. We did not hear other guests within the hotel. The staff was really great- they were very attentive and friendly. They arranged our amazing Vatican tour and our car to the airport, as well as some very nice recommendations to local restaurants. There's not much of a lobby as it is very small and there is no seating, so don't expect to hang out there. However, why would we? Small glass elevator takes you to the upper floors. We arranged to have a private Vatican tour, which was organized through the hotel. Four+ hours going through the Vatican museums and getting detailed historical context (and by-passing all the lines)-- it was phenomenal. Perhaps the one area that can use some work is the breakfast. There wasn't much of one. There was food- danishes and minimal choices of fruit, some juice and coffee. Not much choice and it did not seem that appealing. It was also an awkward arrangement, in what seemed a day room. No real table to eat at- a couch and a coffee table.
