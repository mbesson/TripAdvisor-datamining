The hotel is located on a beautiful walking street in the area of Eixample. This is where all the upmarket shopping and dining is in Barcelona. The hotel is about a 15 minute walk to the Ramblas area but away from all the noise and tourists to enjoy a peaceful nights sleep. The rooms are quite small but furnished beautifully and we had a small balcony which we had coffee on each morning. The concierge desk was extremely helpful and both the bar, restaurant and breakfast were fantastic. The bar had an exclsuive outdoor area on the walking street where you can have drinks and food and watch the world walk by. There is no pool here but you head over to their sister hotel \"Hotel Majestic\" and use their incredible roop top pool and bar. Even if you don't go for a swim, head over to take in the sunset and 360 degree views of Barcelona with a cocktail in hand. The spa at The Majestic is also incredible and I had the best manicure and pedicure here.

It was fine but you would have to be quite tall to see properly over the walls - the view was not really good but that was really the \"luck of the draw\".

Throughout our stay, the staff at the Murmuri were very attentive and quick to respond to any questions. All in all, this hotel exceeded all of my expectations.

It was literally walking distance to everything, so the location could not be beat!

I booked a room on the top floor with a private terrace and 2 double beds for under $200USD/night. If we needed new towels or an iron they were just a phone call away. My only pet peeve was that they did not have wash cloths (only handtowels and regular towels), so I would suggest that you bring your own to plan to buy them in town. The front desk staff spoke English fluently and ensured that we were able to check-in immediately upon arrival at 10am. I unfortunately neglected to get the name of one of the women at the front desk who made fantastic lunch and dinner recommendations (Tenorio and Tragaluz respectively) - she was our culinary savior after one too many meals at sub-par tapas restaurants near La Rambla.

I don't normally bother that much about size as you are on holiday and usually out and about but with large suitcases in tow, it actually makes quite a difference. Our second room was avalable about an hour and a half later which was really great. The only drawback was that the rooms weren't near each other. Even though my kids are teenagers, I like our rooms to be nearby, it's much easier when we're sharing suitcases and one night someone tried the door on our room. This was probably another guest who'd made a mistake but at 3 am, if it had been the kids' room, and they aren't next to us, they'd have got a scare. After our early check in, we came back in the evening and our rooms had been cleaned with fresh towels provided since we'd all had showers that morning. A nice surprise. The hotel is really nicely decorated, all the staff are very nice and very helpful and the location is excellent. The drawbacks are that the rooms are small, as previously mentioned and there was no tea/coffee making facilities in our rooms and the mini bar was expensive, as is usually the case in hotels (over 3 euros for a small bottle of water). My big complaint is the internet charges. This is an expensive hotel, so I do think it should be complimentary. I was told I could have one hour free on the lobby computer for the length of our stay (even though we had 2 rooms). This wasn't very good as apart from anything else, I couldn't access Facebook and it took up valuable time trying to get around in Spanish. I decided to buy internet access for our room which was 15 euros for 24 hours and it was pointed out to me that this was continuous and not 24 hours in total use. Plus it was only for one device (we have 2 ipads) Some might say you're on holiday and don't need Facebook etc but I was trying to contact friends who were also in Barcelona, trying to make bookings for the next part of our trip and trying to check on bank card statements that were on Australia time, never mind 2 teenagers who love their Facebook. All in all, I liked this hotel. If it had internet included I would definitely stay again if I were ever visiting the beautiful city of Barcelona. One tip is be careful when the hotel orders you a taxi.

These rooms are alright, ours had a little terasse, nice bath (no bathtub though), small mini bar, small flat TV (No HDTV).

The location is absolutely fantastic: right on the Rambla de Catalunya, near the metro, shopping, restaurants, and just a few blocks from Casa Pedredra and Casa Batllo. Really convenient and lovely. The apartment itself was spacious and comfortable, with a beautiful terrace. The hotel staff were very nice and accommodating. The bar was fabulous. And it was great to have access to the very nice Hotel Majestic fitness/swim facilities. Now, the big minus. It seems that there is a restaurant kitchen just below the Liceu apartment, and we were kept awake (or were awakened) by crazy restaurant and kitchen noises, including most irritatingly a regular \"thump\" sound - maybe a swinging door? - that echoed throughout the apartment every minute or two. It wasn't so bad on Wednesday and Thursday nights. But Friday, Saturday and Sunday were really bad, and went until 1:30 a.m. The front desk claimed no one else had complained about the noise, but I find that hard to believe. A couple more quibbles. WiFi. As many others have noted, there isn't free wifi in the rooms. The hotel is moving in the right direction by offering free wifi in the lobby. But this seems hardly adequate. Sure, I'm on vacation, but I want internet access to be able to book tickets online, research restaurants, check flights, etc. (never mind about work). I don't understand why the hotel can't fix this issue. Coffee. The apartment came equipped with a nespresso machine. Which was great. Except that there were only a few nespresso capsules provided and we didn't realize (because no one told us) that even these were not replenished daily. We were supposed to scout out nespresso capsules during our vacation in Barcelona? That seemed really silly.

From the moment we walked into the hotel, we were WOW'd. From the decor to the friendly staff (who informed us that they had upgraded our room), and the attention to detail in our room. The bed was extremely comfortable - wonderful pillows - bathroom fantastic - large, plush bathroom towels - warm colors - very, very nice. Hotel Mur Muri is in a great location as well. Right out the door you'll find great restaurants, fantastic shopping and tours of Barcelona (the hotel staff can sell you tour tickets at the front desk). Hotel Mur Muri has a bar that is a great place to have a glass of Spanish wine. Don't miss it. But rarely do you find this kind of personal service. The morning we were leaving, I wanted a cup of Starbucks coffee (which is only 1 block away). It was early and to my dismay, Starbucks had not opened. As I was walking back through the lobby, I asked the staff what time Starbucks opened and was told around 9:30. Mentioned that I really wanted a cup of coffee but oh well...I'll just have to do without. At that moment, one of the staff said - \"I'll go into the bar and make you a cup\". WOW!

I normally use trip advisor to choose hotels because it is generally accurate and had really good experience through its recommendations. Given that the room rate is quite high at ~US$320 per night (we even booked 1.5 month in advance) for a 2 person room and that it is situated in one of the best neighborhoods in Barcelona, we expected service to be just as good. However, the service was a disaster and here are a few bad experience that we experienced. I have never complained on trip advisor, but really feel I should this time since I don't want any reviewers to stay there without knowing the following: - Upon check in, they gave me a room located on the 1st floor. Given that I am a light sleeper, I asked to change room to a higher floor. The manager that was serving me literally rolled her eyes and said \"no\", with no further explanation. Afterwards, the male staff standing next to the manager took over and suggested and magically found me a room. Just surprised me that the staff was more nice than the manager. Perhaps it's an European thing. - They are extremely understaffed and don't think they even have room service reps. When i asked for hotel slippers, the check in rep came to my door with the slippers. Very odd. - A few days later, my sister called the concierge (which also happens to be the same check in rep) to ask for recommendation on restaurants and she asked my sister to call back later because she is busy. I've never been asked to \"call back later\" by a concierge, not even when I stayed at Best Western etc. - I had originally prepaid for the first night through an online booking agency. When I was checking out, they said they never got the prepayment from the agency (very large agency) even though I provided the confirmation. They later acknowledged the confirmation but still asked me to pay in full and that they will later credit the amount back to me once their accounting office is open again (I checked out on a Sat). I told them that I don't live in Europe so it will be difficult to communicate later should I not receive the credit. They weren't happy that I refused to pay extra, literally. - After the check out dilema, I asked to leave my suitcase and to pick it up when I head to airport later that evening. When I went back for my suitcase, it was right in the middle of the lobby where I have left it hours ago. Some safe keeping there!! - Also, don't get worked up with the gym that they offer at another sister hotel (Hotel Majestic) because it is really not worth walking 2-3 blocks. It's tiny and the shower is horrible, worse than my high school gym and locker room (from 10+ years back). Perhaps others experienced better times at Murmuri but I definitely will not return there.

Pros: 1-The staff is very polite and always helpful, ready to give you information, directions, suggestions, etc - this is a major point for us while choosing a hotel. 2- The hotel is very clean and the room, although very small, was nicely appointed. Very comfortable bed and good bathroom . We took a privilege room with a private terrace ( room 603)- it is incredible tiny! It is difficult for two people to move around the room and the luggage block your passage. The door that leads to the terrace doesn\u00b4t open wide because the bed is too close to it. The front desk woman did warned me about the size of the room and offered as an alternative to take a privilege room without the terrace, which is indeed much better in terms of space. We refused because we wanted the terrace. If you don\u00b4t mind the terrace, pick this one without the terrace. 3- Location could not be better. The hotel is in a neighborhood called Eixample, which is very nice, safe and with lots of good restaurants, bar and upscale stores. It is in Rambla de Caltalunya ( don\u00b4t mistake it by Las Ramblas, which is noisy, crowded and dangerous). From the hotel you can walk to the the historic center, a nice walking , take a bus or metro. There are bus stops and a metro station (Diagonal) a block away. Hop on hop off buses also have their stops a block from the hotel. The hotel is a block from Paseig del Gracia which is a beautiful avenue, with its high-end stores and nice bars. You are a block from La Pedrera ( Casa Mila) and a few blocks from Casa Batlo, Gaud\u00ed\u00b4s wonderful buildings. 4- We didn\u00b4t try Restaurant Murmuri because somehow it didn\u00b4t attracted us, but in our way back to the hotel we always stopped at Terraza Bar Marfil for a few drinks and tapas ( a nice outside area on the avenue, good for watching the movement ). Good service. CONS: 1- The breakfast is far below reasonable. Few options, very poor buffet, terrible coffee. If you ask for anything cooked like a simple omelete you have to wait for a long time. The service is terrible, the staff here doesn\u00b4t speak English and it is not properly trained. They don\u00b4t clean the tables right after the customers leaving which leaves the general impression of a very dirty place. Sometimes the cups and cutlery are dirty. You get the feeling that the breakfast area doesn\u00b4t belong to the hotel and complaints are just ignored. That is the only point why I am giving this hotel a 4 stars instead of 5.

It was small, but perfect for sitting out with a drink and watching urban life from a 4th story perch. When we came inside and closed the balcony door, it felt as quiet and peaceful as a private getaway - not a sound from outside - it was amazing! Close the blackout curtains and you wouldn't even know that there was a city outside your window. Now that would have been plenty for me to write a glowing review - but Murmuri deserves exceptional recognition for going above and beyond. The room and all public areas were immaculately clean, the staff was always friendly and helpful, our room was cleaned every day no matter what time we left the room, and they surprised us with a complimentary bottle of champagne and a fruit plate our first night there to welcome us to their hotel and to the city.

So, not a great view, but surprisingly quiet, even with the window open. There was a flat screen TV which appeared to show only Spanish progs (mainly football), but not an issue with us. The furnishings were stylish and clean, but the black furniture was beginning to look a little worn. Disappointingly we only had a shower, but this was probably because we had booked one of the cheaper rooms at Euros 165 per night through hotels.com. The shower cubicle itself was enormous, but its design meant that, instead of water draining through a plug hole, it dripped over the edges and stained the floor of the cubicle. Otherwise, the room and bathroom were v clean and the chambermaids did a good job considering the debris left around the room from my daughter's backpack. (Sorry!) Housekeeping also collected and returned her trousers promptly for cleaning (at Euros 11). The location and stylishness of the hotel are its best bits. It's an easy taxi-ride from the airport at about Euros 27, but also within a stone's throw of the fast, efficient, clean Metro. Along the median running through the boulevard outside (La Rambla de Catalunya) is a succession of restaurants. We tried the recommended Cerveceria Catalanya on the first eve for good tapas, but surly service from a Rowan Atkinson lookalike waiter. El Fornet, just down from the hotel towards Placa de Catalunya, has lovely pastries for breakfast. Also good for dinner was Meson Cinco Jotas nearer the hotel and on the opposite side of the road. We did not try any meals in the hotel itself as it seemed prohibitively expensive and I preferred Spanish food to Asian fusion. But we did treat ourselves to cocktails, which were excellent but dear (Euros 11 for a Martini) and we ended up paying extra for nibbles, which seems a bit mean. We visited Casa Battlo, which is v close, and Parc Guell, which isn't. (Tip: go by Metro; it's a long way on the No.24 bus, although you do get closer to the top). On a wet day, we went to the Picasso Museum to find an enormous queue at 5.00pm. So, even if we'd bothered to stand in line, the museum itself would have been packed. Overall, it was an enjoyable, if expensive trip. Free wi-fi in the hotel would have been so useful for my daughter checking reservations, etc, for her onward journey.

The hotel isn't cheap and any decent hotel that I have ever stayed in in that price range has offered free wifi. We stayed at the gorgeous Viceroy in Miami a week later and not only did we get free wifi, but our room was three times the size and about two thirds of the price of the Murmuri.

One of the restaurants we went into for lunch had free wifi so why on earth wouldn't a 200 euro a night hotel offer it? It makes it very clear that they aren't attracting business oriented clinetele. I also have to agree with another reviewer about being pushed to do the tacky bus tours around the city. I think the front desk staff must be on comission because we got a 10 minute spiel about the bus tour and were really pressured to book a two day tour! I would imagine that most of the clientele that stays in this gorgeous boutiqe hotel would be too sophisticated to be interested, it seemed quite unusual. To sum up I would say that the hotel is beautiful and well located, maybe the management should just re-examine some of the smaller details that takes away from this truly being the high end boutique hotel that it should be.", "Date": "September 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cStayed in Two Bedroom Murmuri Residence Apartments - Very Nice\u201d", "Author": "ensco3", "ReviewID": "UR117582213", "Content": "We stayed for two nights in the suites that are part of the Murmuri (they are about 50 meters down the laneway adjacent to the hotel.

It is a small boutique on the far north end of Rambla de Catalunya, close to the action but in a much quieter area; a perfect location actually. Though I was there for business, I was impressed by all the shopping, dining, and nightlife around the hotel. My room was comfortable, reasonably large, clean, and well equipped with plenty of closet and drawer space, robes, slippers, safe (large enough for a laptop), minibar, hair dryer, toiletries, and other amenities you would expect a good hotel to provide. My room was on the fourth floor facing Rambla, but I was not disturbed by street noise. The room also had a cool little balcony with chairs. High points: * An iPod dock, which was convenient and could be used as a wake-up alarm. * The room had a fairly sophisticated lighting system that allowed several different settings for different moods and uses. * Wireless internet was no charge \u2013 at least for me. My colleagues were unable to find a complimentary connection. * The air conditioning was superb. I was able to get the room down to about 19C/66F. This is a particular concern for me in European hotels, where air conditioning often seems more like an after-thought and I end up sleeping poorly because of a hot, stuffy room. Downsides: * The bathroom had a variety of hair plastered to the sink, tub, etc. The tub had some grunge that was not very attractive. Otherwise, the room and common areas were clean and appeared well maintained. * My room rate did not include breakfast but given that my room rate was only 157\u20ac, I would not really expect it. However, there was no in-room coffee either and this was inconvenient in the mornings. Nevertheless, they did offer breakfast at 12\u20ac if (I think) I agreed to buy it for each day of the stay. I declined, but this was a pretty good offer considering many hotels want as much as 30\u20ac for breakfast. I was very pleased with the Murmuri and I definitely recommend it when in Barcelona for business or pleasure.

My hours will hopefully pay off for you if we have anything in common and you are very picky. First i don't burn money but i have great taste. I must have certain amenities in a hotel. This one had them all. Murmuri is a best bet and after my trip i am certain of it now. First of all i reviewed all of the neighborhoods and chose L Eixample for location. it was very convenient to food, metro, shopping. While we do not spend too much time in the hotel, i need the luxury. The bed was great, sheets were amazing, pillows perfect. Staff friendly. Quiet on the fourth floor. CLEAN. Great bathroom, great mirror in the bathroom and clean towels daily of course. Turn down service in the room was nice as was the lighting. all in all the room was a ten for the price. Location was a ten as well. it is within a short distance to Casa Mila and all of the upscale retails stores. Great little pastry shop to the right and down the next side street. We had coffee and pastires there every day. Maudi is ok but this was better. We took the Metro to Familia and La Ramba. Easy to get on and off but we did do the tour bus the first day to make our way around the city. Nice to recover from your travel by sitting up top and getting the lay of the city. Not necessary but it helped. We skipped food in LaRamblas and was glad after taking the better advice of the locals. Within walking distance is the Catalana restaurant -by far the best tapas in the city ...you must try the Cabreaos. Try all of their desserts especially the Catalonian Cream. We ate there three times and had completely different meals on every occassion. Sangria is great too as is their local beer Estrella. This too is a short walk from the hotel. The Majestic was rated high on the list in Trip Advisor and is located a few blocks down. I didn't like the big scale of it and the Murmuri is actually owned by the same company...so for a boutique experience and smaller size, this was for me the best. I saw the locations of many of the Trip Advisor options and still would book this site over any that i saw. The photos on the web site are accurate and we had a Superior Room. The LaRambla tended to be a big disney like stroll with hundreds of people which at night would be nothing but noise if you are trying to sleep. If sleep is not an option you are reading the wrong review and you will find many options for less money and more noise. The Murmuri has a sexy bar attached and an upscale restaurant attached. We did not typically eat past nine and this restaurant didn't open till 8. We didn't opt since we had other options. We hit the high spots of the city and glad we checked out Parc Guell with its beautiful gardens. We took a cab since the walk was straight up. Only about 5 euros. We also went up the Columbus column again great views worth it. We did Montjuic via the tour bus and got off for some Sangria at the first stop to catch the view. The Picasso museum did not have his full collection but seeing his first works was very enlightening. Don't go on free days line is crazy. Gaudi's Casa Mila was great doing the tour to the roof. The Familia was sufficient just doing the exterior. The lines were hours long. We took a half day trip to Montserrat and it too was worth the trip. We took the train about an hour out of the city and it stops right at the base of the mountain. Take the cable car to the top. We skipped the three hour line to see the Madonna and instead used our camera zoom to view the small statue from the sanctuary. You can check the weather from a webcam online before you go. If you only have a few days in the city, stick to the old parts of the city if you have not traveled to Rome or Paris. It will be enough to keep you intrigued. When you are leaving, don't forget to appreciate the beautifully designed air terminal. It was an architectural high. The only other mention would be our travel time was in June and the weather was great with no humidity. Trip Advisor comments have always paid off for me so i hope this helps you. This is not Rome but cleaner and you don't have to pay to pee. This is not Paris but the waiters are not snobs and they don't pee on the street. We loved the city, the people, the music, the tapas and sangria at Catalana.

The subway is half a block away, and the No. 24 bus (to Parc Guell) is only a block away, so the location is very convenient. We initially booked a smaller \"design\" room but upgraded to a superior room with a balcony overlooking La Rambla Catalunya for not a huge amount more. That was a real treat. The room was large enough, though not huge, but nicely appointed and furnished, with a very large extremely comfortable bed (2 twins together) with lots of comfortable pillows. We loved the balcony--great place to have a glass of wine and watch the strollers on La Rambla. The bathroom was huge, and very nice, with large tub with shower in it, towel heater, thick, large plush towels, robe, slippers, nice toiletries, and openable window. The flat screen gave us ready access to English-speaking news channels. We used the room safe which was very easy to operate (with English instructions.) Plenty of closet space. The staff was very courteous and solicitous-extremely helpful. We wanted ice-they brought it. A wine bottle open-they opened it. The glass elevator and sleek modern interior were neat features. The building itself is very attractive. We didn't use the bar or restaurant, as we ate in neighborhood places while out touring. But both looked inviting. The hotel was quiet, had turn-down service, and made one feel pampered and taken care of. I would highly recommend the Murmuri, and would absolutely stay there again if we return to Barcelona.

Good - the location is fabulous! There is a metro station just a few steps from the apartment door, lots of restaurants, shops and bars nearby and Murmuri's proximity to the major Gaudi attractions was excellent. The welcoming bottle of Cava and fruit platter for our honeymoon was also a lovely touch. The apartment itself was very well designed and an excellent size. It had a well designed bedroom, including a desk area and quite a lot of cupboard space, reasonable size bathroom with large shower, excellent lounge and kitchen area complete with dining table and a separate laundry with second toilet. It was lovely to come home after a busy day of sightseeing and be able to relax in our lounge room before heading out again. I must note that having access to a clothes washing machine and dryer was fabulous and saved us lots of time and / or money. Booking several months in advance and taking advantage of the long stay offer meant the apartment was extremely good value for money. Not so good - the reception staff were aloof and not very helpful at all. There are no maps or tourist related information in the rooms so it was just as well we were equipped with reliable guide books. The cleaning staff's attention to detail was also a little haphazard. For example, the room set up was different most days and some days they forgot to collect the rubbish and on one day they even left the large garbage bag with our rubbish and the rubbish from their cleaning in the middle of our apartment entrance way. The apartment was also not as described on the internet when we booked. We booked the one bedroom apartment with terrace however on arrival discovered that they do not have a one bedroom apartment with terrace. (It was still however a well appointed and spacious apartment however a terrace would have been a treat and as we booked this we were expecting it). The supplies in the kitchen were very limited so if you were wanting to cook you would be quite restricted with what you could make. Similarly given there was a laundry in the apartment I expected there would be an iron and iron board however not so. After waiting around an hour an iron and ironing board were delivered to our room however I would recommend that they update their iron as this was very old and fairly ineffectual. Also the apartments are located directly opposite a construction site so even with the roller shutters (excellent light block out) the construction noise was very loud. This started from 7.30am with lots of shouting and truck unloading followed by power tools starting at 8am. There was definitely no opportunity for a sleep in. Finally the other negative would be the cost of wifi. To access wifi you had to buy a card which was reasonably expensive, particularly when everywhere else we stayed had free wifi. So for location, the convenience of having more space in an apartment and the excellent price we received I would recommend Hotel Murmuri.

They leave the doors to these establishments open and every time you walk in the hotel, if the bar & restaurant are open, you are hit in the face by smoke. - While we were on a non smoking floor, there was a ton of smoke coming through our vents.

Kelly, let me tell you that a double bed in Murmuri's superior room is actually two singles pushed together and held together by nothing but gravity and any sort of cross-bed travel that you may decide to undertake for whatever reason is likely to get your bottom bang onto the cold floor between the two of them. Let me tell you also that there is no concierge in this hotel at all and the reception people are sleepier than Siberian bears in the middle of January. Rooms are tiny. Water from the (swanky, stylish, boutique and generally glamorous) tap trickles into the equally glorious sink with at such vertiginous speed that it takes only about half an hour to wet a toothbrush. The haute couture shower seemingly lacking a thermostatic valve flips between boiling and freezing at its own discretion quickly and without warning.

My husband was attending a meeting at the Palais de Congress just below Montjuc. He had a 15 - 20 minute trip via Metro. The Metro station (Diagonal) is one half block from the hotel. The Rambla Catalyuna has a wide pedestrian median with narrow one-way streets on either side. In the median are many outdoor cafes, bistros, etc. One block over is Barcelona's equivalent of Michigan Avenue in Chicago.; the Ple de Gracia is lined with top designer stores. On the side treets are the top restaurants in Barcelona. On every block there is a bank, a pharmacia, a parfumeria, a bakery, a lingerie shop, a shoe stores etc. The \"all important\" Starbuck is an immediate left down a side alley. 45 minutes of internet access per purchase. For Americans, it is one of the few places with \"Amercian or British or French style morning coffee. The Catalans drink espresso either straight or with \"latte\", i.e. milk. I love espresso in the evening, but I need my large drip or french press coffee in the morning. Did I mention that the Familia Sagrad is a mere 2 metro stops away? We stayed in 301, which fronted the street and had a king size bed. There was no street noise at night. It is a lovely street, but it is not a \"main drag\". I noted in an earlier review the mention of lack of drawer space. Not so! The two small wardrobes had ovehead shelves and two bottom shelves. The night stands each had 2 drawers and the TV stand had drawers. It is hanging space that is in short supply. Only one wardrobe had hangers. Those with many suits, dresses, etc. will have limited space. The bathroom has a large amount of storage space due to a shelf under the sink and counter. My only complaints were first the lack of an iron in the room. Yes, housekeepig delivered a board and iron upo request, but the iron was a puny appliance incapable of reaching a hot temperature. My second issue was the TV. It is a lovely,flat creen TV. Sadly, the hotel advertises that international channels are provided. International must mean Catalon and Spanish. There was not one English speaking channel. French and German did not exist either. Given the nationalities of the cliental, this must be remedied. We have relocated to a Hilton managed property which has over a dozen English channels includinging CNN, FOX, FOX News, CNBC, BBC, Europsorts and several French and German channels. Murmuri can do better. I don't understand the \"pricey\" comments. What do people expect to pay for a designer boutique hotel in a prime location in a major European or USA city.

My colleague and I arrived at the Murmuri ~ 10:30PM exhausted from a long work day and flights from Amsterdam. On arrival, we were greeted and asked inside, then we were told that unfortunately there were no rooms available (although we had both booked through American Express - our corporate travel booking agent). We were then asked to wait for a cab that would then take us their \"5-star sister property.\" Remarkably, I recalled reading the review, and objected, but was told there was no option. On arrival at the sister property, we were greeted in a rather ambivalent manner and given our rooms. I suggested that for the inconvenience, perhaps the hotel would like to buy us a drink. I was told no, but given the option of an upgraded room. I agreed. When show to the room, I looked around and saw no windows; sure the room was big, but there were no windows, only 2 small skylights. 5-star in this case was well beyond questionable. When I objected, I was taken to a much smaller room with a window (and a view of scaffolding) that smelled oddly of bacalao, body odor, and egg. Pissed-off, but with no obvious alternative, my colleague and I went to dinner. Over dinner, we relaxed a bit and decided to switch hotels. We moved after dinner at ~ 1AM. Best decision ever. There is no possible way I can recommend this hotel. However, he following afternoon, we did stop in to the sister hotel to speak with the manager and verify there would be no charges. She was very gracious, and a radical departure from her nighttime staff. She presented her card, and requested that next time I plan a stay in Barcelona, I call ahead and she'd guarantee a room in the Murmuri.

We stayed in Room 602 which I believe is shown on the hotel's website photos showing a Privilege Room. Small(ish) but has all the amenities and comforts we could have asked for. The kingsize bed was so comfortable and there was no noise at all from the busy street outside. The curtains are blackout curtains allowing for a quiet and restful night's sleep. French doors opened up to a very sizeable terrace with 2 sun loungers and a table/chairs for 2 - a joy in a busy big city like Barcelona. The bathroom had everything we needed and a great bathtub - be advised there is a window overlooked by neighbouring rooftops but we came to the conclusion that noone could actually see in and threw caution to the wind as we stood and showered by the window! I took baths which were blissful but my husband's mild complaint was that the 'raindrop shower' didn't give much pressure. The hotel is perfectly located. It's a short stroll to Gaudi's Casa Mila & Casa Botllo (on the parallel street Passeig de Gracia - where all the high-end luxury brands have their stores). At the bottom of Passeig de Gracia (or the hotel's street/Rambla de la Catalunya) is Placa de Catalunya, the other side of which is La Rambla. Don't confuse the hotel's elegant street with La Rambla - a bit rough round the edges these days and full of tacky tourist attractions although still worth a visit. Diagonal metro station is about a 2 minute walk from the hotel and from there you can go north to Gaudi's fabulous Parc Guell, or head in the other direction (just 2 stops) to the incredible Sagrada Familia or go 2 stops to Passeig de Gracia where you can switch lines to head to the Barrio Gotico, Barceloneta or a host of other hot spots. I really can't think of a better location in Barcelona from which to go sightseeing. We returned from a rather enthusiastic sangria drinking evening by the Cathedral and popped in the bar at the hotel for a nightcap. This was a bit disappointing - a very narrow bar with beautiful decor but funnily enough very little ambience. The drinks were way overpriced as they often are in hotels. I would suggest bypassing the hotel bar and instead finding alternatives. If you have a room with a balcony as we did, and fancy an early evening aperatif, there is a small supermarket about a block away which sells very cheap beer & wine (3 EUR for 6 San Miguel beers). It was a nice end to our jam packed days, to return to the hotel, wrap ourselves in the luxurious robes and 'slice of heaven' hotel slippers, have a shower/bath and then head to the terrace with an ice cold beer and a book to unwind before heading out for the evening. There aren't a lot of amenities at the hotel (no fitness room, etc although they do have a partnership with the larger Majestic Hotel about a 5 mins walk away for spa treatments) but if you're looking for a huge chunk of comfort, close proximity to all the main sights of Barcelona, wonderfully friendly staff and a lovely room, this is the place for you.", "Date": "April 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "United States", "Title": "\u201cFantastic!\u201d", "Author": "O2BCyrus", "ReviewID": "UR61227045", "Content": "We just returned from Barcelona where we spent three nights at Hotel Murmuri. The hotel was very clean (and we're picky about that point), and the staff was extremely helpful to us -- we simply could not have asked for more accommodating hosts! Other reviewers have done a good job of describing this modern hotel's features, but I wanted to answer for others a few of the questions I found unanswered before my travels. 1) This is a very nice neighborhood. No worries there -- it's probably the nicest (and safest) part of Barcelona. If you're looking at the tourist guidebooks, the neighborhood is called Eixample. 2) In addition to the Bar Marfil and Restaurant Murmuri on the hotel premises, there are plenty of cafes and restaurants nearby. Be aware that many of them will be closed on Sundays, but some will remain open (your number of choices will be diminished, but you won't go hungry!) 3) There are a pleasant number of people on the streets in the evening. Rambla de Catalunya is NOT Las Ramblas (which is the loud and noisy and screaming area with a lot of bars and horns honking and whatnot). There is plenty to see and plenty of people to watch, but not the level of noise and revelry that will keep you up late at night. You can walk or Metro to Las Ramblas if you want the activity, but then escape to more civilized surroundings when you return to your hotel to rest. 4) There is LOTS of high-end shopping in this area. Not my thing, but if you want to gawk at Gucci and other high-end design stores, this is the place to be. 5) You're one block from Le Pedrera (Casa Mila), and the local tourist bus stop; 2-3 blocks from the \"Block of Discord,\" where Casa Batllo is one of three stunning Modernista buildings; 1/2 block from Diagonel Metro stop, and right around the corner from a fabulous coffee and pastry shop (Cafe Mauri). 6) The staff at Murmuri are incredible and very helpful. They do speak English very well, which was helpful to us as our Spanish is poor (at best!). 7) The rooms do not have universal electrical adapters, but Murmuri has them -- just contact the front desk. 8) The hotel doesn't exchange currency, but there is a bank across the street that does, as does the more staid Hotel Majestic, which is located about 2 blocks away (Murmuri and Majestic are both owned/operated by Majestic Hotel Group). We thought exchange rates were decent at both places. 9) The rooms are spacious by European standards (less generous space than American travelers are used to, but our room at Murmuri was certainly more spacious than at the also-fine Majestic (see separate review for our first night stay at Majestic). Here are a couple of hints: HINT #1: Keep the hotel address at hand. This is not a giant hotel that every driver knows (in Barcelona, there aren't a lot of 1,000 room Hiltons -- it's full of the smaller, boutique hotels like Murmuri), so it's important to have the address in hand. It's also important to know the cross streets to look for so that you can find it (Carrer de Provenca on one side and Passtage de la Concepcio on the other); I recommend printing out the map on the hotel's website just to be sure you won't miss it the first time you look for it. HINT #2: Know that you will need to look directly AT the building to see the sign for Murmuri -- it is tucked inside the alcove to the doorway, rather than standing out at right angles so oncoming traffic can see it. Murmuri is an old building that has had a wonderful makeover on the inside, but the outside edifice still the traditional stone facade. (I'm probably not explaining this very well: what I'm trying to say is it's a great hotel, but the signage isn't great and you need to look AT it or you'll miss it. See their website at murmuri.com to take a look at their photo of the sign and you'll see what I mean -- I mention this because we almost passed the hotel without noticing it.).", "Date": "April 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel, gorgeous room and great location\u201d", "Author": "EnglandBeach_lover", "ReviewID": "UR61101005", "Content": "Stayed here for our 10th wedding anniversary and got a great deal on a privilege room.

The area is nice and there are plenty of places to eat and drink around it. Very convenient for Gaudi houses and only 15 mins pleasant walk to Place Catalunya (and bus to/from airport if you want) The hotel is very stylish and all fittings seem to be high end quality makes \u2013 bath, washbasin, shower, TV etc. We had booked a double superior and were initially allocated 202 which was a smoking room. After a bit of a wait we got room 302 which was non smoking. Our info in advance had said that designated smoking rooms were available on request whilst in practice it seems there is a need to specify non smoking. The room was very nice \u2013 a huge bed, good lighting with choice of settings \u2013 relax, ambient etc, good bedside reading lights and room light controls at bedside. Small balcony which was a pleasant bonus \u2013not really for sitting out but nice to get fresh air. Three narrow wardrobes at different points of the room gave adequate storage, although a bit tight on space to access the room safe in wardrobe beside chair and near window. Access to mini bar almost impossible as opened against the room where chair blocked robe door. Bathroom beautiful and all aspects worked well. All areas very clean and housekeeping did a good job \u2013 as if by magic (never saw them once anywhere in the hotel) TV had about 500 channels but we couldn\u2019t find one in English. A call to reception on day 2 solved this and girl pressed analogue button I think which gave access to English channels, so don\u2019t assume they aren\u2019t there. Breakfast was the main let down. The food was fine, but somewhat limited. Choice of 3 juices, cereals, croissants, pain au chocolat, some bread, nice preserves, smoked salmon or ham salad sandwiches, cheeses, ham. The highlight for me was the scrummy fruit kebabs. Have to say staff were not quick to replenish items. Also, breakfast was supposed to be until 11am but the food was whisked off about 10.50. Hot food was available to order but was all at an additional charge. One euro for bacon, 2 euros eggs, 3 euros for omelette. What a cheap move. I know times are hard but when you are paying these prices that is cheap and shoddy. However, the system/service was woeful. No one to greet you so you just sat down. You would wait ages until anyone came near \u2013 and they were only interested in asking your room number(which they usually forgot and had to ask again.) No interest whatsoever in offering tea or coffee (getting blood from a stone comes to mind) Tea was half a cup of luke warm water from a flask with a teabag to follow unless you asked for a pot. Never in 3 days were we asked would we like tea or coffee or would we like more tea or coffee. Easiest just to get up and go to the workstation and get it yourself but usually they had run out. There was a bottle of cava in an ice bucket on the way in at the opposite end of the dining room from the rest of the breakfast but it was certainly never offered by the staff. Maybe you had to ask for it\u2026on the basis of charging for bacon maybe you had to pay. I\u2019ll never know!! The bar was pleasant for a drink and was usually quite busy \u2013 seemed to be a place to be seen. However, as with everywhere in Barcelona smoking is prevalent ( if you are used to UK and Ireland no smoking in public places laws and don\u2019t smoke it can be very off putting but that\u2019s just something you have to get used to.

All in all, I recommend the hotel, with just a few reservations. We had a privilege room which was clean, comfortable and nicely decorated. The highlight was a large terrace that looked right out over Rambla Catalunya. Breakfast, included in our rate, was quite good, with a choice of fruits, yogurts breads, hams and cheeses, etc. One could order eggs as well. We liked the fact that the hotel is new and modern. It is also very well located-- only a 10 minute walk from the Rambla, but we were happy to be staying in a more upscale area, out of the noisy and touristy hub of activity. On the downside, the atmosphere in the hotel was very \"hipster, trendy.\" Accordingly, while the staff looked the part, we found them not particularly warm or friendly, and they ran the gamut from fairly competent to totally inefficient. We had asked the desk to make reservations at the hotel restaurant (located only a few feet from the front desk), but when we arrived for our dinner they did not have our reservation. The staff at the restaurant and bar were almost laughably incompetent. Also, the hotel itself did not have much character-- it was pretty sterile in tone. Aside from the bar and restaurant, there were no common seating areas. For this reason, we were especially thankful to have our terrace. We tend to like the smaller boutique hotels because they have a more unique personality than chains, but we did not find this to be the case at the Murmuri. Despite these issues, we thought that the Murmuri was a nice hotel and a good value compared to other similar hotels, and thought the location was perfect.

It's extremely well situated on Rambla de Catalunya, within walking distance of plenty of tapas bars/cafes/restaurants/tourist attractions (la Sagrada Familia is a 20-minute walk) and there's also a tube station just round the corner. Rambla de Catalunya is really pleasant as it has a pedestrian area in the middle where all the bars and restaurants have their terrace. The hotel bas (Bar Marfil) has a good atmosphere and lovely cocktails! The restaurant looked nice but we didn't end up eating there (too many tapas bars and local restaurants to choose from in the area). The hotel has no fitness center (really not a problem as far as I was concerned!!) but if you want you can use the facilities in the Majestic hotel just 5 minutes away. I'd booked a Superior room and was not disappointed. Quite often the photos that hotels put onto their website are not quite representarive of what you get but in the case of Hotel Murmuri I got exactly what the website showed: a bright, spacious and stylish room with plenty of gadgets (iPod docking station, ambiance lighting in room and bathroom, flat screen TV etc...). Bathroom facilities (and size) were excellent, and everything was very clean. As we were going for my boyfriend's birthday I'd ask them to get a bottle of Cava ready in the room. They rang me up the day before to confirm time of arrival and we found the Cava perfectly chilled when we got there. Front of House staff very helpful and polite. Breakfast buffet was also very good in my opinion with a decent selection of pastries, bread, cheese, cured meats, fruits, yogourts, omelettes etc... Shame that on day 2 the waitress in charge looked like she was having a bad day and was not exactly welcoming, but that really didn't stop us from enjoying ourselves!!! In summary, had a great stay and would definitely go back to Murmuri again.

Stayed in a privilege double/early booking offer. For this you pay up front for the room at a preferred rate and cannot cancel the booking. Included in this rate was breakfast. Firstly the hotel. small hotel in a nice part of town. Thursday night was very quiet but Friday and Saturday there was some screaming and shouting in the street, goodness knows how people cope with sleep in La Rambla, it must be a nightmare. Staff were pleasant and helpful. All bedrooms either look out onto placa de catalunya or a side street. We stayed in room 210 which looked out onto placa de catalunya and had a small balcony with 2 chairs. The room was on the smallish side but adequate, but this was perhaps due to the extremely comfortable HUGE (approx 7' wide) bed. There were two full length mirrors and you could choose from seductive lighting or full room lighting. There was a large flat screen TV with BBC and ITV channels and news channels. The bathroom was average size, lots of towels and the White Company products. There was a fairly powerful shower over the bath. Unfortunately the bath was a disaster. Being a shower perswon myself this is not usually a problem, but after hours of trumbling around Barcelona, a nice long soak was on the agenda. I sat in the nice deep bath lay back and nearly drowned. It was totally impossible to lay back in the bath without sliding under the water and drowning. The same happened when my husband tried the bath. I ended up laying on my stomach - I kid you not! The bar is very comfortable with seductive lighting and a nice atmosphere. There were people of all ages coming and going. Unfortunately the drinks were very expensive 11 euros for a coctail, 5.50 euros a glass of wine, 6.00 euros for a spirit plus 3 euros for a mixer. Perhaps not too bad when the exchange rate is better. After 2 nights dining in one average restaurant and one terrible restaurant, we decided to try the hotel restaurant which is thai/asian cuisine. The service was excellent, the portions very small, the food extremely tasty, and the price for 2 approx 100 euros (including a bottle of wine at 18 euros (the cheapest). This by comparison to other nearby restaurants was about average, many other restaurants were much much more. The breakfast was good - plenty of choice - cereal, fresh fruit, yoghurts, pastries, meats and cheese, toast and eggs of any type - scrambled, boiled, omlette, etc. but no other hot choices except bacon. This was included in my booking but i would not pay 20 euros for it. all in all we were very satisfied with the hotel, would recommend it and would go back if we could get a good deal.", "Date": "April 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham", "Title": "\u201cWould definitely return and recommend to family & friends\u201d", "Author": "StrumpetNottingham", "ReviewID": "UR28341614", "Content": "We had a fantastic stay at Murmuri at the begining of April.

We asked for advice on a few things, such as a good seafood restaurant in the area, and were never disappointed.

The MurMuri is a lovely hotel. I had requested an early check-in since I arrived in Barcelona after an overnight flight. My room was ready and waiting when I arrived at the hotel. The reception desk staff were outstanding - always friendly, pleasant, helpful. All questions were answered fully, and if the staff member wasn't sure about something, they would go online to look it up or check with another staff member. The room we were assigned was on the 6th floor (top floor) and had a terrace off of it. It was quite nice as was the bedroom. The room was not huge, but there was plenty of storage area for clothes and suitcases. The terrace had two chaise lounges on it and an umbrella table with chairs. There is also a larger terrace that is open to all guests on the rooftop. The bathroom was very large, modern, with a deep tub and shower and, a fully closing glass sliding door, something you don't often find in Europeon hotels. The room and bath were very clean and modern. Our room came with a continental breakfast which was about the same each morning. However, I never tired of it as it was quite good. It offered cereal, a choice of five or six pastries, sliced cheeses and meats, fruit juices, coffee and tea, and the very freshest and delicious fruit. The sliced fruit included kiwi, pineapple, watermelon, musk melon, oranges, grapefruit and whole strawberries. The fruit was top quality. I enjoyed the breakfast very much. There was an option for ordering off a small menu if you preferred a larger breakfast with eggs, etc.and I assume this was at extra cost. My daughter and I never felt the need to do so as the continental breakfast was so lovely. The continental breakfast was available from 7-11am so it gave us plenty of time to eat even when we slept in a little later. Because this is a smaller hotel, there is not a large lobby with sofas and chairs so it is not a lobby in which you gather there to meet, chat, or read. The reception area is somewhat long and narrow and there is only one sofa against a wall that was located right by the front door. It seemed to be a place to sit for only a short wait. The other thing I should mention is that there is a flat screen TV mounted on the wall in the bedroom, but I couldn't locate any English speaking stations on it. The hotel was very quiet and I did not hear much street noise. It is located in Eixample so it is a bit of a walk to Catalunya square, maybe fifteen minutes or so, depending on your pace. We thought the hotel was in a good location and we appreciated being in a quieter area, but within walking distance of much of what we wanted to see and do. There are many good places to eat in the area, and there is a Metro stop a short walk from the hotel. We have stayed at many hotels over the years in many areas of the world and this hotel was quite lovely. I will definitely stay there again when I return to Barcelona. I booked there because of reviews I read on Trip Advisor, and I am so glad I did. I think the hotel staff sets the tone for how you feel about a hotel, and this staff was surely outstanding in both making us feel welcome and always being helpful and pleasant.

Obviously this is a problem in most cities , but it is certainly rife in Barcelona , and I have since spoken to countless other people who have had bags and wallets stolen there - it certainly seems to have a much higher level of pickpocketing/ mugging then any other City i have visited.

The Staff: Impeccable is probably the easiest way to describe them, on hand 24/7 to ensure that your stay is what it is meant to be, perfection, front of house, bar and restaurant, cleaning staff and management were all great throughout the stay. The Service: We had 30 people all wanting different things from Barcelona during their stay and the service that the Hotel Mur Muri provided ensured that these expectations were delivered. The Restaurant: We had meals here on two of the nights and also breakfast every morning during the stay, excellent cuisine that is of the same standard of what has been set out above. The Bar: Class, World Class, brilliant service and great drinks. The Rooms: Designed with both flair and intelligence, simple touches such as the I-POD docking stations made for a great stay. On departing many of the Guests commented on wanting to bring the bed and pillows home with them as they were so comfortable. The Location: Ideal, close to everything but set in a calm street with little or no noise pollution I have organised many incentive trips for many people but the Hotel Mur Muri will set the standard for many years to come, brilliant service with the right attitude.
